detection and control directions of an Animal Control Officer, licensed veterinarian, law
enforcement officer, or state official concerning that dog. An owner receiving such notice shall

Section 12. Procedures on Violation.
The Animal Control Officer (ACO) or Police Department (WPD), on complaint of any person, or
on his own initiative, may initiate prosecution for violation of this ordinance by filing a complaint
with the Maine District Court for the division that includes the Town of Waldoboro and serving a
summons and a copy of the complaint upon the owner. In the alternative, the municipal officers
may, if they desire and if funds are available, engage and appoint counsel to prosecute the
alleged violations.
The ACO or WPD shall quickly and fully investigate all known or suspected violations of this
ordinance received from any citizen and keep a record thereof the ACO or WPD will report
complaint and findings to the Chief of Police. The ACO or WPD is required to maintain a public
file, located in the police department, of all complaints and findings. Nothing in this ordinance is
intended to bar or limit the right of individuals to make written complaints concerning dangerous
dogs pursuant to State Law, or bar or limit any law enforcement officer from proceeding to act
upon such a written complaint in accordance with the State Law.
A. Order of the court. If, upon hearing, the court determines that the ordinance has been
violated, the court may impose an appropriate penalty. If the court determines that a dog
is a dangerous dog, the court may order the owner to muzzle the dog, and to restrain it
and confine it to the owner's premises; however, if the court finds that the dog has killed,
maimed, or inflicted more than de minimis bodily injury upon a person, or upon a
domestic pet or farm animal, or the court determines that the dog has a history of
attacks, then the court should ordinarily order the dog to be euthanized. Such
euthanasia shall be at the owner's expense.
B. Failure to abide by a court order. An owner's failure to comply with an order issued
pursuant to Section 11, Paragraph A, constitutes a violation of this ordinance, and may
be punishable upon a new summons or as contempt, following issuance of a show
cause order on affidavit of a law enforcement officer. If an order of euthanasia is not
complied with by the time set upon by the court, the court may, upon application by the
ACO or WPD or other person, upon notice to the owner, issue a warrant to the ACO or
WPD to destroy the dog and make return of the warrant to the court within fourteen (14)
days from the date of the warrant. The owner shall pay all costs of any supplementary
proceedings and all reasonable costs for seizure and euthanasia of the dog. A failure to
pay such costs by anytime stated in the order of the court for making such payment
constitutes a distant violation of this ordinance, which may also be punished on
proceedings for contempt after issuance of a show cause order.
C. Complaint for dogs presenting immediate threat to the public. After filing a complaint in
District Court and before hearing, the dog shall be subject to muzzling, restraint, or
confinement upon the owner's premises upon order of the law enforcement officer who
filed the complaint to the owner, if that officer believes that the dog poses a threat to the
public. The owner may prescribe the degree of restraint or confinement. Failure to
comply shall constitute a distinct violation of the ordinance. Upon failure to comply, and
after notice to the owner, the officer may apply to the District Court for an order of
authorization to take possession of the dog that poses an immediate threat to the public
and turn it over to care of a suitable person or organization, at the owner's expense. The
Court in its final order shall include an order to the owner to pay such expense in a
stated amount.
Adopted by Town Meeting - April 28, 2016

Section 13. Penalties.
For initial violation of this ordinance by an owner, the owner shall be ordered to pay a penalty of
not less than fifty dollars ($50) nor more than two-hundred dollars ($200). In determining the
amount to be forfeited, the court shall consider any evidence in mitigation, extenuation, or
aggravation, it considers pertinent to the offense, including but not limited to the civility and
degree of cooperation exhibited by the owner. For further violations the penalty shall be
increased by a minimum of fifty dollars ($50) above the immediate proceeding violation. All
penalties awarded shall accrue to the Town of Waldoboro. An owner found to have violated this
ordinance shall pay all fees and surcharges assessed or required by a court or court order or
rule and shall pay court costs.
Section 14. Effective Date.
This ordinance shall take effect upon passage at any municipal town meeting.
Section 15. Severability.
Should any portion of this ordinance be found invalid for any reason by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then all portions not found invalid shall remain unaffected and will continue in full
force.
Section 16. Repeal.
This ordinance shall supercede the Town of Waldoboro Ordinance Regulating the Control of
Dogs adopted March 4, 1968 and as amended June 10, 1971 and June 10, 2004, which is
hereby repealed from and after effective date of the adoption of this ordinance which is April 28,

Preface
This is the 13th revised edition of the General Assistance Manual. It has been prepared in a
binder and loose-leaf format, with tabbed sections, so that the administrator can keep this
manual, the General Assistance Ordinance, the DHHS Policy and supplemental materials
together in an organized manner. Since DHHS’s audits require municipalities to demonstrate
the possession of a copy of its GA policy, along with a current municipal GA ordinance, this
binder should serve administrators in keeping all required material organized and readily
available.
Please note however, this manual does not contain a GA ordinance. Municipalities should
place a copy of the GA ordinance they have chosen to adopt after the Chapter 14 tab. The
ordinance was intentionally omitted because it could not be assumed that the municipality
has adopted the most recent version of the MMA model ordinance. In addition, the DHHS
Policy must also be inserted (after the Chapter 15 tab) once obtained from DHHS.
Consistent with the general style of all MMA Legal Services’ manuals, this manual is
intended to help the administrator interpret state law, while providing practical examples,
problems and possible solutions. Furthermore, where necessary, legislative history and the
reasoning behind certain laws and practices are provided in an effort to assist the user in
reaching a better understanding of the subject matter.
It must be emphasized that this manual is not a “law book,” and specific legal questions
should be directed to DHHS, the municipal attorney or the MMA legal staff.
The information in this manual reflects General Assistance law effective as of October 9,
2013. All references to state law refer to Title 22 unless otherwise stated.

CHAPTER 1 – Introduction to General Assistance
What is it?
General Assistance (GA) is “a service administered by a municipality for the immediate aid
of persons who are unable to provide the basic necessities essential to maintain themselves
or their families.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(5). The key terms in this definition are: immediate,
unable and basic necessities.
GA is intended to provide immediate aid, thus assistance must be granted or denied within
24 hours of an application. It is for people who are unable—not unwilling—to maintain
themselves or their families. Finally, GA is intended to help people with basic necessities:
food, shelter, utilities, fuel, clothing, and certain other items, when they are essential.
What it is not.
GA provides “a specific amount and type of aid for defined needs during a limited period of
time and is not intended to be a continuing ‘grant-in-aid’ or ‘categorical’ welfare program.”
22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(5). Despite the stated intent that GA not be an ongoing source of
income to an applicant, there is no limitation on the number of times a person may apply for
and receive GA.
One of the most common misconceptions about GA is that it is only an emergency program
and people cannot receive assistance after a certain period. Contrary to this perception, it
should be noted that the state law also reads:
“This definition shall not in any way lessen the responsibility of each municipality
to provide general assistance to a person each time that person has need and is
found to be otherwise eligible to receive assistance.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(5).
In other words, there is no limit on the number of times people may apply for and receive
general assistance if they are eligible.
2
Finally, because GA is not a “categorical” welfare program, it is not limited to providing
assistance to only specific groups or categories of people as is TANF,1 to families with
dependent children, or SSI for disabled people.
Theoretically GA is available to anyone2 in the state at any particular time who meets the
eligibility criteria. GA is the program of last resort—it is the “safety net” intended to help
those people who have no other resources. GA is the only comprehensive program to help
people who are not eligible for any other assistance program.
What is Required?
Ordinance, Notice of Hearing & Hearing
Each municipality is legally required to administer a GA program in accordance with the
state law and an ordinance adopted by the municipal officers. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305. Prior to
adopting the ordinance, the municipal officers must hold a public hearing. Notice of the
hearing should be posted publicly at least seven days before the hearing. Notice should be
posted in the same places where the town meeting warrant is posted or other places where
people commonly look for public notices. The notice must give the date, place and time of
the hearing and must contain the full text of the ordinance or indicate where copies are
available for people to review (see Appendix 1 for sample notice).
At the hearing the municipal officers should explain the purpose of the ordinance, give a
brief summary of its provisions, and then open the public hearing for comments from the
citizens. After people have had a reasonable period to discuss the proposed ordinance, the
hearing should be closed and the municipal officers should proceed with their discussion.
After the municipal officers have considered the ordinance and any changes, one of the
officers should make a motion that is seconded by another and voted upon by the majority.
There must be a record of the vote. It is suggested that the clerk be present to record the
minutes, the motion and the votes. After the ordinance has been adopted, the municipal

officers must send a copy of it, plus samples of any GA forms and notices the municipality
uses, to:
Department of Health and Human Services
General Assistance Unit
State House Station #11
Augusta, ME 04333
Any amendments made in the future must be adopted in the same manner as an entire
ordinance, and the amended parts of the ordinance must be sent to the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS). Don’t forget to adopt (by October 1st of each year or as soon
as possible thereafter) the new Appendixes A-C containing the yearly GA maximums,
which MMA sends to all municipalities. DHHS must also receive confirmation that the
municipality has adopted the appropriate maximums each year.
(For further information see Chapter 11, Q & A, “Miscellaneous”).
GA Program Public Notice
Each municipality must post a public notice informing the citizens that the municipality has
a GA program administered in accordance with a local ordinance. The notice must also state
when and where people may apply for assistance and where they may review the ordinance
and the state’s General Assistance statutes, as those statutes are made available to each
municipality by DHHS for the purpose of citizen review. The notice must also inform
people of the municipality’s obligation to issue a written decision regarding eligibility
within 24 hours of receiving an application for assistance, and the name of the municipal
official applicants should contact for assistance in emergencies.
Depending on the size of the municipality, the administrator may want to post the Police
Department’s telephone number and inform people to contact the police if it is an
emergency and assistance is needed at a time when the GA office is closed. The police, in
turn, could contact the GA administrator. Finally, the posted notice must contain the DHHS
toll-free telephone number 1-800-442-6003. The law does not specify where or in how
many places notice should be posted, but DHHS regulation requires that the notice be posted
so that it is visible 24-hours a day. Therefore, at a minimum, the notice should be posted on
a window or glass doorway facing out at the municipal building where GA applications are
taken. The same notice can also be placed on bulletin boards or other locations where people
commonly look for public notices (see Appendix 2 for sample notice).

Standards
The purpose of the GA ordinance is to establish procedures for administering the program
and standards of eligibility. At a minimum, the ordinance must state: how eligibility is
determined and the type and amount of assistance applicants are eligible for; that no one
may be denied the opportunity to apply; and that a written notice of the administrator’s
decision will be given within 24-hours of the submission of an application whether
assistance is granted or denied; and that applicants have the right to appeal the
administrator’s decision. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(3).
The ordinance describes what type of assistance a person may receive and the maximum
amount the municipality will grant. Since December 23, 1991, with the enactment of
22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(3-B), GA law refers to—and GA ordinances contain—two types of
“maximum levels of assistance”: an overall maximum level of assistance which is
determined by law, and maximum levels of assistance for the specific basic necessities,
which are determined by local ordinance.
The overall maximum level of assistance is a predetermined number of dollars that
represents the maximum GA grant (except in certain emergency circumstances) that can be
issued to a household with zero income. Effective October 2005 that predetermined number
is supposed to be 110% of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) Fair Market Rent standards as published annually in the federal register. However,
the maximum level of assistance has been “temporarily” changed on several occasions since
2005, due to a weak economy and budget constraints at the state level. Please review the
most recent version of 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305 to ensure you are using the correct formula used
to calculate the overall maximum level of assistance. As will be discussed in detail under
the chapter covering the determination of eligibility (see Chapter 2), these overall maximum
levels of assistance are used to determine an applicant’s gross eligibility for GA. The gap
between the applicable overall maximum level of assistance and the applicant’s income is
referred to as the applicant’s “deficit.”
The other type of “maximum level of assistance” referred to in the law are the various
maximum levels that the municipal ordinance creates for any specific basic necessity, such
as food, housing, electricity, etc. These maximum levels must be reasonable and sufficient to
maintain health and decency. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(3-A).
As another test of GA eligibility, in addition to determining the applicant’s “deficit,” the
maximum levels for the specific basic needs are also used as guides to determine a person’s
need and how much the applicant is eligible to receive. A detailed discussion of this test of
5
eligibility is found in Chapter 2 (see “The Deficit Test”). The specific “basic need”
maximum levels are also used as caps on the amount of GA issued for any particular basic
need.
For example, if an applicant was eligible for $520 worth of assistance, but the applicable
maximum for rent was $430, the administrator would typically issue only $430 over a 30-
day period for rent, and the applicant’s remaining $90 worth of assistance would be reserved
for other basic needs, up to the particular maximum level of those other necessities.
There are two important aspects about maximum levels to keep in mind. First, the levels
must be reasonable and reflect the cost of living in the area. For instance, if rents start at
$100 a week in your area, but the ordinance only allows $70 that would be unreasonable.
Secondly, if the maximum levels are reasonable, they will be valid provided that the
ordinance has provisions that permit the administrator to exceed the maximums in
emergency cases. For instance, if a family of five was about to be evicted in the middle of
winter, the municipality might have to exceed its maximum levels, either for alternative
housing or to pay the back rent, because to be without shelter in the winter would be an
emergency.
Maximum Levels of Assistance & DHHS Regulation
Of all the statutorily defined basic necessities, there are two for which the maximum levels
established by the local ordinance are potentially controlled by DHHS regulation: the
standards of assistance for food and housing.
The DHHS rules establish as a rebuttable presumption that the U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan
and the HUD Fair Market Rental Statistics represent adequate levels of food and
rental/mortgage assistance. The concept of a rebuttable presumption means that a
municipality may adopt levels of food or housing assistance which differ from these levels
of adequacy published by the federal government; but in order to do so the municipality
must conduct a local fair market survey that demonstrates that the locally-developed
standards are adequate.
It would be extremely difficult to develop a credible local fair market study that justified
levels of food assistance which were lower than the Thrifty Food Plan. Rental rates, on the
other hand, are tied to vacancy rates and the overall economy in such a way that it is entirely
possible that local rental rates differ significantly from the HUD statistics. Fortunately, local
fair market rental surveys are relatively easy to conduct and develop, and any municipality
that feels the rental rates published by HUD are unreasonable should seriously consider
6
employing the “rebuttable presumption” option by generating a study of actual, local rental
rates. This matter is discussed in further detail under “Housing.”
Who Administers GA?
State law requires every municipality to have a GA program (§ 4305). The people
responsible for administering the program are the overseers. The overseers can be the
municipal officers (selectpersons or council), or the municipal officers may appoint
someone to administer the GA program. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(12). If no one is appointed to
serve as the overseer, the municipal officers must assume the responsibility.
People appointed by the municipal officers to administer the program must be both sworn
and bonded prior to assuming their duties. For the purpose of these bonding requirements,
there is no need under Maine law for the designated GA administrator to be bonded as a
separate municipal official as the municipal treasurer is bonded pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A.
§ 5601 or as the municipality may require the clerk to be bonded pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A.
§ 2651. The bonding of the GA administrator may be accomplished as part of a blanket
fidelity bond covering a number of municipal officials.
Who May Apply for GA?
Perhaps this is the easiest thing to know about GA, because anyone may apply. People who
are rich or poor, old or young, long-time residents or newcomers may all apply. Whether
they are eligible is a different matter, but no administrator should assume that a potential
applicant will not be eligible and refuse to let him or her fill out an application. The most
dangerous mistake an administrator can make is to prejudge people and refuse to allow them
to fill out an application because the administrator “knows” that the prospective applicants
could not possibly be eligible. People wishing to apply have the right to request assistance in
writing each time they apply. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305.
When and Where May People Apply?
Regular Hours
Each municipality must establish a GA office or designate a place where people may go to
apply for assistance. The specific periods of time when people may apply are, for the most
part, left to the discretion of each municipality; however, the hours must be regular and
reasonable. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4304. Reasonable means the administrator must be available a
sufficient number of hours to process applications. If very few people apply, two hours a day
7
one day a week may be sufficient; if more people apply, the hours must be adjusted
accordingly.
The administrator must post public notice of the day(s) and hours the administrator will be
available to accept applications. If the administrator does not establish specific hours, he or
she must accept applications any time a person wants to apply. If the municipality has
established specific hours, for instance 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays,
people may apply only during those hours on those days. If an applicant wanted to apply on
Tuesday, he could be told to apply during the posted hours on Wednesday because people
can be required to apply only during the designated hours—except in emergencies.
In an emergency people may apply for assistance at any time. It is the administrator’s
responsibility, not the applicant’s, to determine if the request is an emergency. The
administrator or designated person must be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to
accept applications for emergency assistance. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4304.
Telephone Applications
In emergencies, the administrator must take applications over the telephone if the person
cannot apply in person. Reasons why a person may need to apply by telephone include:
illness or disability which prevents people from applying in person, lack of transportation,
lack of child care, or an inability to send an authorized representative to apply in person.
22 M.R.S.A. § 4304. In the event an exception is made to the general rule of requiring an “in
person” application, the applicant should be instructed that he or she will be required to stop
by the municipal office as soon as possible thereafter (or at least by the time of next
application) in order to sign an application. It is not unreasonable for the municipality to
require that an applicant provide his or her signature on an application. It is also not
unreasonable to generally require an “in person” application, conducting telephone
applications only in exceptional cases. (See Chapter 5 for further discussion).
District Offices
State law allows two or more municipalities to join together to establish a district GA office.
This is permitted when the number of applicants in the participating communities is too few
to justify an office in each municipality. In order to establish a district office, the legislative
body of each participating municipality must vote its approval, and the financial and
administrative operation of the district office would be subject to the terms of an interlocal
agreement established by the participating towns pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2201 et seq.
8
The office must be located in a place that is accessible to any applicant in the district without
having to pay telephone toll charges. If the district office is established, it must be open at
least 35 hours a week and a person must be designated to take applications at all other times
in the event of an emergency. Notice of when and where the administrator is available must
be posted in each participating municipality. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4304.

CHAPTER 2 – Eligibility Criteria
Residency
One issue that has been a source of confusion over the years is residency. While a GA
applicant’s residency is something to take into consideration when taking an application, it
is not a condition of eligibility. In fact, the only purpose of discussing residency is to
determine which municipality is ultimately responsible for providing GA to applicants.
Residency is no longer the applicant’s problem, as it was under the pauper settlement laws
when indigent people could be shuttled between communities and sent back to the
municipality where the applicants had their “settlement”—often their birthplace. The
apparent reasoning behind settlement was that poor towns should only be required to
provide support to their “own people.” Under settlement, if people left one town and moved
to another town they weren’t considered settled until they had lived in the new town for five
consecutive years without receiving assistance. If people needed assistance during the time
they were trying to gain settlement in the new town, they had to receive it from the town
where they were settled and they could be “removed” by their new town to their place of
settlement for support. If people needed “immediate relief,” the municipality where they
were present had to provide it but could seek repayment from the town of settlement.
Maine courts were full of municipalities suing each other and squabbling over such arcane
matters as whether people had been temporarily absent, people’s personal habits, and
whether “pauper supplies” had been given in good faith. Although Maine repealed
settlement in 1973, it continued to have a durational residency requirement until 1976, when
durational residency was also repealed.
Residency requirements in welfare laws rose to constitutional proportion in 1969 when the
United States Supreme Court ruled that certain durational residency requirements were an
unconstitutional infringement on a person’s right to travel as guaranteed by the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment. Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322. The Shapiro case
concerned a challenge to the requirement adopted by most states that people be residents of
a state for one year before being eligible to receive AFDC. The Supreme Court ruled that the
one-year residency requirement was unconstitutional because it did not promote a
“compelling governmental interest” and that there was no rational basis for making a
distinction between longtime and new residents.
10
Durational residency requirements, which unreasonably restrict people from moving to or
from a state by limiting their access to public benefits, are unconstitutional. Although the
constitutionality of durational residency requirements which would act to restrict intrastate
travel was never fully reached in the most pertinent Maine case. Wyman v. Skowhegan, 464
A.2d 181 (Me. 1983), it is probable that durational residency requirements would be found
equally suspect, from a legal perspective, if people could be denied public assistance by
various municipalities within Maine solely on the grounds of the applicants’ length of
residency. The issue of “right to travel” is no longer particularly relevant, however, because
there is an express prohibition on durational residency requirements in the law (§ 4307(3)),
and along with that prohibition there is the concept of “municipality of responsibility.”
Municipality of Responsibility
Generally, Maine law states that municipalities have the responsibility to provide GA to all
eligible persons who are:
? residents—people who are physically present in a municipality with the intention of
remaining there and establishing a household; or
? non-residents—people (including transients) who apply for assistance who are not
residents of that municipality or any other.
In short, there is no durational residency requirement. If a person is applying for assistance
in a municipality and he or she does not live there but isn’t a resident anywhere else, that
person is considered a resident of the municipality where the application is made and that
municipality must grant GA if the person is eligible. Municipalities cannot refuse to grant
aid to people merely because they are not residents. Residency is not an eligibility
condition! 22 M.R.S.A. § 4307.
Example: Laura Green has lived in Litchfield all her life, where many members of the
Green family live. One day Laura packed up and left Litchfield and moved to Shapleigh,
where she applied for GA. Shapleigh felt certain that Laura was Litchfield’s responsibility
and told her she would have to apply in Litchfield. Shapleigh’s decision was wrong because
Laura was 1) physically present in Shapleigh, 2) intended to remain there to maintain or
establish a home and 3) had no other residence...therefore, for the purpose of GA, Laura was
a resident of Shapleigh.
Example: Alvin Eliot has been a transient most of his life. One summer he drifted through
Maine, moving from town to town and working odd jobs. One week he received some
assistance from Augusta, and a month later he was in Castine, where he applied for more
11
food assistance. Castine called MMA to find out if Alvin was the responsibility of Augusta
or of Castine. MMA said that Alvin was the responsibility of Castine because he was
applying in Castine and he was a resident of no municipality, and his case contained none of
the relocation or institutional complications that make exceptions to the general residency
rule (see below).
Example: Dawna Jones applied for GA in Presque Isle, even though she lived in New
Sweden, because she was told that New Sweden didn’t appropriate any funds for GA and
because the administrator did not believe she was a resident. The Presque Isle administrator
contacted the New Sweden administrator and told him each town had to have a GA program
to help eligible people and diplomatically attempted to convince him to accept an
application from Dawna Jones. Luckily, the New Sweden administrator agreed to take the
application. If he had disagreed, Presque Isle could have suggested that New Sweden call
the Department of Health and Human Services or MMA for advice. However, if New
Sweden refused to take the application, Presque Isle would have been required to take the
application and issue the assistance for which Ms. Jones was eligible because there was a
dispute between the municipalities.
Disputes & Inter-municipal Cooperation
The only way the complexities of residency determinations can be dealt with efficiently is if
the various municipalities within a residency issue communicate and cooperate with each
other. The whole point of eliminating a durational residency requirement was to prevent
applicants from being treated as volleyballs and being caught in the middle of a dispute
between municipalities. State law is clear: “nothing (in the law) may…permit a municipality
to deny assistance to an otherwise eligible applicant when there is a dispute regarding
residency.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4307(5).
In other words, if two municipalities disagree about which town is financially responsible to
issue GA to a person, one of the municipalities is required to assist the applicant if he or she
is eligible. The eligible applicant must receive assistance; the municipalities can argue about
who is responsible for paying the bill later. Ultimately, it is DHHS who resolves these
disputes. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4307(5).
When there is a dispute regarding which municipality is required to provide the assistance
sought, the municipalities involved should first seek guidance from MMA or DHHS.* If a
resolution cannot be reached, the municipality in which the application is filed must provide
the assistance and then seek a final determination from DHHS. DHHS must reach a decision
regarding such a dispute within 30 working days; if the municipality that did not pay is
12
deemed to be responsible; then it has 30 working days from the decision to reimburse the
municipality that did pay. If reimbursement is not made within those 30 days, DHHS will
seek reimbursement from state funds (such as revenue sharing) that are due to the
responsible municipality.
* NOTE: Due to potential conflicts of interest, MMA Legal Services can involve itself or
facilitate communications on such issues only if all municipalities involved agree to
MMA’s involvement.
It should also be pointed out that § 4307(1) provides that “any municipality which…
illegally denies assistance to a person which results in his relocation…shall reimburse twice
the amount of assistance to the municipality which provided the assistance to that person.”
Obviously, it is hoped that this type of financial penalty would not be necessary, but to the
extent municipalities can self-police each other’s actions and otherwise work cooperatively
so that all eligible applicants get their assistance in an efficient manner, the less likely it will
be that the Legislature will step in and place even stiffer penalties in the law.
Complications to Residency
Moving/Relocating
From time to time applicants may request assistance to help them move to another town.
Municipalities may help people relocate upon the applicant’s request under certain
circumstances. It is illegal under Maine law, however, to send a person out of town solely to
avoid granting assistance. For instance, it would be illegal for an administrator to tell
applicants that there are not any jobs in town, that the town has no intention of supporting
them for the rest of their lives, and that they should leave town, and then force them on a bus
to another town or state!
It is legal, however, to help an applicant relocate to another town if he or she requests that
type of assistance and if such assistance makes sense (i.e., relocating the applicant is the
only way to provide him or her with shelter). Examples of when relocation would be
reasonable include when the applicant is hired for a new job in another town and needs help
to move, or when a family is evicted and there are no other suitable places to live in town. It
is important to note the difference between the authority of a town to help an applicant
relocate and an obligation of a town to relocate an applicant on demand. Under Maine GA
law a municipality is not obligated to relocate an applicant, provided the basic necessities
are available within the municipality.
13
It is also important that municipalities communicate with one another when GA is used for
the purpose of relocation. A sample form which can be used by a “sending municipality” to
notify a “receiving municipality” that a GA recipient has been relocated is found in
Appendix 3.
If a municipality helps applicants move to another municipality, the municipality which
provides the relocation assistance continues to be responsible for those applicants for the
first 30 days after relocation. The law extends this obligation from 30 days to 6 months if
the relocation is to a hotel, motel or other place of temporary lodging in the other
municipality (see “Complications to Residency—Institutional Residents” below). It is for
this reason that municipalities should always avoid placing GA recipients (even temporarily)
in temporary lodgings. In the event no permanent housing arrangement can be found, always
call DHHS to see if other alternatives exist before placing a GA recipient in a temporary
dwelling.
In other words, if Milbridge paid a family’s first month’s rent to help them move to
Cherryfield, Milbridge would be responsible for assisting the family with other basic
necessities for which the family was eligible (food, electricity, fuel, etc.) during the first
month. Once recipients relocate to the new town they can apply for assistance in the new
town, or if the town of former residence is not far and they have adequate transportation they
can apply directly to the municipality of responsibility during the first 30 days. If it is
impractical to apply in the town where they previously lived, the administrator in the new
town must take the application, notify the municipality of responsibility and upon its
approval grant assistance according to that town’s ordinance or have that town provide the
assistance directly.
The most important factors to keep in mind regarding people who have received relocation
assistance are:
? If applicants are applying for the first time in your town, ask them if the municipality
where they lived previously helped them move, so you can determine if the other
municipality is still responsible. Ask all applicants where they lived previously and
whether they received GA.
? If applicants received GA to help them move, notify the other municipality prior to
granting assistance; if you fail to provide such prior notice the responsible municipality
does not have to reimburse you. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4313.
14
? If the municipality which is legally liable for the applicants’ support refuses to
reimburse your municipality without a good reason, you must assist the applicants and
attempt to recover the expense from the other municipality another way, including
court. (In situations like this you can encourage the uncooperative town to call DHHS
or MMA for clarification of the issue, or if negotiations are futile you can report the
situation to DHHS.)
It is important to emphasize that the 30-day responsibility falling on the “sending town”
only applies when the sending municipality has provided relocation assistance; there is no
continuing responsibility if the applicant relocated without municipal assistance, except
when the relocation was to an institutional setting (see below).
Institutional Residents
In 1983 the Legislature attempted to address the problem faced by municipalities that have
one or more institutions in their communities to which people from surrounding areas come
and later often need assistance. People who are in an institution six months or less are
considered to be the responsibility of the municipality where they were residents
immediately prior to entering the facility (Example 1 below); if they are there more than six
months they are the responsibility of the municipality where the institution is located
(Example 2 below). The only exception to this is if an applicant has been in an institution
more than six months but has a residence in another town that the applicant has maintained
and to which he or she intends to return. In that very rare circumstance, the applicant
continues to be the responsibility of the municipality where that residence is located
(Example 3 below), 22 M.R.S.A. § 4307(4(B).
Example 1: Dan Gordon from Limerick entered a halfway house for substance abusers in
Eliot. He had been there four months when he was told he could stay as long as he wanted
but he would have to pay for his food. Mr. Gordon applied to Limerick for food assistance
because that was where he lived prior to entering the rehabilitation program and he had been
in the institution less than six months.
Example 2: Beverly Fogg and her two children had been in a shelter for abused families in
Oakland for eight months. She felt strong enough to go out on her own, and started looking
for apartments in Oakland and also Waterville, where she lived prior to entering the shelter.
She found a place in Waterville and applied for GA there. Waterville told her that Oakland
was responsible because she had been at the shelter longer than six months. The GA
administrator called Oakland and discussed the situation. Oakland agreed that Ms. Fogg was
the responsibility of Oakland.
15
Example 3: Joan Kaplan’s mother had been in a nursing home in Skowhegan for eight
months. She was in the nursing home recovering from an operation because Joan could not
give her the care she needed at the family’s home in Bingham. However, as soon as she
recuperated, Joan’s mother was going to return to Joan’s home in Bingham where she had
lived prior to going into the hospital. Unexpectedly, Joan’s mother developed pneumonia
and died at the nursing home.
Joan did not have any money for the funeral so she applied for GA in Bingham. The
Bingham GA administrator noted that Joan’s mother had been out of town in an institution
for more than six months and therefore felt that Skowhegan should be responsible.
Skowhegan felt that Bingham should be responsible because according to the doctor, Joan’s
mother intended to return home and she would have returned if the pneumonia had not
developed unexpectedly. As a result, Bingham should have assisted Joan because that was
where her mother lived prior to her death and her home, to which she intended to return, was
located there. This should be distinguished from a case where people enter a nursing home
but have no home to return to despite their desire to “go home.”
Shelters for the Homeless
Shelters of various kinds are generally recognized as institutions (§ 4307(4)(B)). Individuals
in those shelters who are applying for GA could be the responsibility—for up to six
months—of the municipality where they resided immediately prior to entering the shelter if
the conditions found at § 4307 are met (e.g., the municipality moves an applicant into
another municipality to relieve itself of the responsibility for the GA recipient at issue). In
addition, § 4313’s notification of the municipality of responsibility requirement must also be
met.
The municipality of responsibility is a fairly straightforward determination for domestic
violence and substance abuse shelters because the people in those shelters often had a
clearly established residency immediately prior to entering the shelter.
Shelters for the homeless, however, present a unique challenge to municipal administrators
with regard to the determination of municipality of responsibility. A resident of a homeless
shelter often has a complicated residential history, and it is difficult to determine if the last
town in which the shelter client was physically present was, in fact, that client’s “residence”
as residency is defined in GA law.
As discussed above, there are two factors that determine whether a person is (or was) a GA
“resident” of a town. First, the person must be (or must have been) physically present in the
16
municipality. Second, the person must have demonstrated some sort of intention to remain
in that municipality.
For the purposes of determining residency in institutional circumstances, it is not enough
merely to determine that the shelter client was physically present in Town X before entering
the shelter. The shelter client’s intention to remain in Town X must also be established.
“Intention to remain” might be determined by evaluating how long the person resided in
Town X; whether the person made any attempt to secure housing in Town X; whether there
were reasons beyond the person’s control, such as eviction or domestic violence, which
caused him or her to leave Town X and ultimately end up in the homeless shelter, etc.
It is important to note that transients are the responsibility of the municipality where they
are physically present. Therefore, it is fair to say that most applicants applying for GA from
a homeless shelter are the responsibility of the municipality where the shelter is located.
Shelters for the homeless, like any institution, do not want to be perceived as a burden to
their host municipality. One way to protect the host municipality is to make sure the GA
requests coming out of the shelter are targeted to the responsible municipality so that the
host municipality does not have to deal with GA applicants for whom there is no local
responsibility.
Therefore, it is not unusual for shelter operators to assist shelter clients in filling out GA
applications and sending those applications to the town the shelter operator feels is the
municipality of responsibility. Administrators should carefully evaluate the issue of
residency when receiving such applications, because it is possible that the shelter’s
interpretation of residency law conflicts with the interpretation given here. As is the case
with any residency issue, DHHS is the ultimate arbiter.
Hotels, Motels & Places of Transient Lodging
In addition to what would commonly be understood as an “institution” (such as a hospital,
nursing home, emergency shelter, etc.), § 4307(4)(B) defines a “hotel, motel or similar place
of temporary lodging” as an “institution” when the municipality has provided assistance or
otherwise arranged for a person to stay in such temporary lodging facilities. Therefore, if the
municipality has provided assistance for an applicant to stay in a place of temporary lodging
in another municipality, the “sending” municipality would become the “municipality of
responsibility” for the first six months of the applicant’s stay in those temporary facilities.
17
As a matter of DHHS General Assistance regulation, temporary housing is further defined as
any facility that is licensed as an “eating and lodging place or lodging place as defined at
22 M.R.S.A. § 2491.” Therefore, if a municipality provides assistance for a recipient to
move to a licensed rooming house in another municipality, the “sending” municipality
would be responsible for that recipient’s GA needs for up to six months from the date of
relocation, unless the recipient subsequently relocated to permanent housing, in which case
the responsibility would drop to 30 days from the date of that second relocation. In any
circumstance, a municipality that is providing out-of-town relocation assistance to any
recipient would be well advised to make sure that the relocation is to permanent housing.
Example: Lilian Gould and her family applied for shelter assistance in Kenduskeag. There
were no rental units immediately available in Kenduskeag, and so while Lilian was looking
for an apartment, Kenduskeag met her short-term shelter needs by putting the family up in a
motel in Bangor. A Kenduskeag selectperson received a call six weeks later from the Bangor
General Assistance office informing him that the Gould family was seeking assistance to
relocate from the motel into an apartment in Bangor. Kenduskeag carefully read § 4307, and
correctly reasoned that Kenduskeag was the municipality of responsibility for the relocation
because it had provided assistance for the family to live in an out-of-town motel.
Kenduskeag also would remain responsible for 30 days after the relocation to the new
apartment at which time Bangor would become responsible.
Initial vs. Repeat Applications
Before going into detail about the eligibility determination process, it will be helpful to
review the differences between “initial” and “repeat” applicants insofar as the determination
of a person’s eligibility is concerned.
Initial Application/Repeat Application
The underlying purpose of drawing a distinction between an initial applicant and a repeat
applicant is to provide a person applying for GA the opportunity to learn about the rules of
the program before those rules are applied. For example, most adult GA recipients who are
unemployed and are physically and mentally capable of being employed are required to
diligently look for work as long as they are receiving GA. If a repeat GA applicant is
unwilling to make a good faith search for employment, that applicant can be disqualified
from the program for 120 days. A person who never applied for GA before, however, would
presumably not be aware of this rule and it would be unfair to apply a 120-day ineligibility
status to an initial applicant for the reason that he or she had not been diligently seeking
employment prior to seeking help from the town.
18
As another example, § 4315-A places a responsibility on all GA recipients to use their
income on basic necessities, and establishes a procedure whereby income received into the
recipient’s household over the 30-day period prior to an application for assistance and not
spent on basic necessities is still counted as income available to the household. This
procedure, however, only applies to repeat applicants. The law presumes that the initial
applicant was not aware of such a requirement.
Having some foreknowledge of the rules of the program is the premise underlying the
concept of “initial applicant.” While retaining that underlying premise, the law was changed
with regard to the definition of “initial applicant.” Since July 1, 1993, an “initial applicant”
is very simply a person who has never before applied for GA in any municipality in Maine.
Any person who has applied for GA before, even though it might have been two, three, four
or more years ago, is a “repeat applicant.”
Prior to this change in the law, an initial applicant was any person who had not applied for
GA within the last 12 months. Because of this change, a significantly greater number of
applicants will be “repeat” rather than “initial” applicants because they have a history of
applying for GA. The result of this change in definition will be a larger pool of “repeat
applicants” applying for assistance, and GA administrators can expect these repeat
applicants to possess a general understanding of GA program requirements.
The primary effect of this law is that it requires all repeat applicants to report their use of
income over the last 30 days, and in response to the information provided by the applicant,
administrators are authorized to consider any “misspent” income as “available” income. For
a more in-depth discussion of this procedure, please refer to the section of this chapter
entitled “The Availability of Misspent Income.” Furthermore, municipalities are authorized
under this definition of “initial applicant” to withhold the issuance of emergency General
Assistance to “repeat” applicants when those applicants could have averted the emergency
with the appropriate use of their own income and resources. For a more in-depth discussion
of limiting emergency assistance, please refer to the section of this manual dealing with
emergency GA, particularly the section entitled Misuse of Income in this chapter.
In summary, under current GA law, initial applicants are all people who have never before
applied for General Assistance in any municipality in Maine. Repeat applicants are people
who have, at some time in the past, applied for General Assistance to any town or city in
Maine.
19
Having laid out the current status of the law, it should be noted that there are a couple of
irrational results stemming from an overly literal application of this change that should be
avoided.
As has been mentioned, the primary effect of this change is to hold all repeat applicants
accountable for their spending decisions over the last 30 days. Another common expectation
of all repeat applicants is that they have adequately performed any work search obligations
that were placed on them at the time of their last application. Typically, any unemployed but
otherwise employable recipient is required to make a good faith effort to look for a job a
certain number of times per week between applications for GA.
Because a “repeat” applicant is now defined as a person who has applied for GA at some
time in the past, it is now the case that a person applying for assistance after being off the
program for a number of years is a repeat applicant. As a repeat applicant, that person could
be held responsible in a technical sense for documenting a work search effort spanning the
several years since his or her last application. While it would clearly be appropriate to
inquire about such an applicant’s actual work history during an extended period of time, and
while it would also be entirely appropriate to inquire about such an applicant’s work search
efforts over the last month, it would be neither reasonable nor appropriate to disqualify such
an individual for failing to produce a documented work search effort spanning an extended
period of time during which the individual was neither applying for nor receiving GA. This
is an area of GA administrative practice that requires the application of good common sense
and reasonableness.
Another irrational result that could occur from too zealously applying the concept of “initial
applicant” concerns the definition of “applicant.” In MMA’s model General Assistance
Ordinance, the definition of “applicant” clarifies that a person is an applicant for General
Assistance when the individual applies for GA or when an application is submitted to the
administrator on an individual’s behalf. A typical example of such a circumstance would be
the husband or boyfriend who never comes into the office when his wife or girlfriend applies
for assistance. Because the definition of an “initial” or “repeat” applicant has been amended
by law, it is important to formally recognize that people are still “applicants” even though
they get other people to apply for GA on their behalf.
Given that definition of an “applicant,” the MMA model ordinance goes on to clarify that a
person will not be considered to be a repeat applicant if the last time that person applied for
General Assistance was as a dependent minor in a household. This model ordinance
language is designed to flush out the statutory standards in accordance with some semblance
20
of reasonableness. Adults who make an effort to avoid the face-to-face application process
but still obtain and enjoy the GA benefits should be subject to the rules that govern all GA
recipients. On the other hand, dependent children in a household could very well be unaware
of the fact that the household is receiving GA, not to mention the various rules and
responsibilities to which the adults in the household are subject. MMA’s model GA
ordinance, therefore, considers an individual an initial applicant if he or she has never
applied for GA before or if the only time he or she applied for GA was as a dependent child
within an adult-supervised household.
Eligibility–Need
If knowing who may apply for assistance is the easiest part of administering GA, knowing
who is eligible is the most difficult. In order to determine an applicant’s eligibility the
administrator must have a thorough knowledge of the state law, DHHS policy and local
ordinance. There are many variables that must be considered when determining a person’s
eligibility. The first eligibility test is need.
Need
The purpose of GA is to help people who are in need. “Need” is defined in the law as “the
condition whereby a person’s income, money, property, credit, assets or other resources
available to provide basic necessities for the individual and the individual’s family are less
than the maximum levels of assistance established by the municipality.”
An applicant’s “need,” therefore, is a function of the maximum levels of assistance
established in the municipal ordinance, and there are two types of maximum levels of
assistance by which this analysis of need is calculated:
? an overall maximum level of assistance which is determined by law, and
? maximum levels of assistance for the specific basic necessities, which are determined
by local ordinance.
Therefore, there are two tests of eligibility that must be calculated before a household’s
exact eligibility is known with certainty.
As a general matter of GA practice and for the purposes of this manual, these two tests of
eligibility are respectively known as the “deficit” test and the “unmet need” test. The deficit
test is the difference between the applicant’s household income and the appropriate overall
maximum level of assistance. The unmet need test is the difference between the applicant’s
household income and the household’s 30-day need, as guided by the ordinance maximum
21
levels for the specific basic needs. Both of these tests rely on a determination of the
applicant’s household income.
A comprehensive discussion concerning the determination of income, types of income and
other income issues can be found below in this chapter. For now, and for the purposes of
determining an applicant’s eligibility, it will be assumed that the precise household income
has been calculated.
The Deficit Test
In an effort to control the overall cost of the GA program to the state and municipalities, the
Legislature in 1991 enacted a provision of GA law § 4305(3-B) that created an “aggregate”
or overall maximum level of assistance for every applicant/household; that is, the maximum
amount of GA available to a household for a 30-day period if the household has zero
income.
The law sets that overall maximum at the greater of: (a) 110% of Fair Market Rent (FMR)
levels established by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); or
(b) the prior year’s calculated overall maximum as increased by the percentage change in the
federal poverty levels over the past year. Note, however, that the Legislature changed the
formula for calculating the overall maximum for the period July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013
(see § 4305(3-C) and again changed this formula for fiscal years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015
(see § 4305(3-D)). Please refer to state statute to ensure you are using the most recent
formula established for calculating the overall maximum level of assistance.
The FMRs are calculated by HUD based on accumulated market data concerning the
average rent-plus-energy costs for housing in the state’s 16 counties.
Although the overall maximums established by this law are based on federal fair market rent
surveys, the GA administrator should not confuse these overall maximum levels of
assistance with the maximum levels of assistance in the ordinance for housing. The overall
maximum level of assistance is a hard number that applies to the total GA grant for a 30-
day period.
As a result of the current law that establishes two tests of eligibility for GA, MMA has
suggested two distinct names for the purposes of distinguishing these two tests of eligibility:
the “deficit” test, and the “unmet need” test. The first screen or test of GA eligibility is
accomplished by determining the applicant’s deficit. The deficit is a strictly mathematical
22
subtraction of the applicant’s income from the applicable overall maximum for that
household size for the appropriate county as designated in the municipal ordinance.
It should be noted that an applicant is not automatically eligible for his or her deficit. It is
possible (although not typical) for an applicant to have a deficit of a certain amount but have
no real need for that amount of assistance when the applicant’s actual expenses are taken
into account. For this reason, the deficit test should always be supplemented with the unmet
need test, as described below. The way GA law works, an applicant is eligible over the
course of a 30-day period for the household deficit or the unmet need, whichever is less.
The only circumstance by which an applicant can be found eligible for more than his or her
deficit is when the administrator makes a finding that the applicant is facing an “emergency
situation.” The determination of eligibility for emergency GA and issues surrounding
emergency assistance are discussed below in this chapter. It should be noted here that the
analysis of eligibility for emergency GA will necessarily involve more than a determination
of the applicant’s deficit. The emergency analysis will require an analysis of the applicant’s
unmet need.
The point to remember is that the overall maximum level of assistance upon which the
deficit is based is a somewhat arbitrary number that may or may not reflect the amount of
money a household needs to get by for 30 days. The unmet need, on the other hand, more
accurately reflects the household’s actual requirements.
The Unmet Need Test
The determination of need, whether it is an initial or subsequent application, is achieved by
reviewing the household budget.
The household budget is simply an analysis of the household’s prospective 30-day financial
need for basic necessities. It is important to remember that the analysis of need is
prospective; that is, the “needs analysis” looks forward over the next 30 days and does not,
generally, include expenses or debts which have already been incurred.
The GA program is designed to pay current bills for basic necessities. Debts incurred by
the applicant prior to applying for GA or debts incurred by the applicant for nonessentials
are not considered in the 30-day budget. While it is possible the applicant is
eligible for emergency GA to alleviate a legitimate emergency situation which results as a
consequence of past debts, the need for an emergency GA grant would be an independent
23
analysis, calculated separately from the 30-day budget analysis (see the section entitled
“Emergencies,” below in this chapter).
MMA’s GA application form takes the administrator and the applicant through the budget
process under the application section entitled “Expenses.” Under that section, for each of the
various identified basic necessities, there are two columns in which to report information.
Under the column heading “Actual Cost for Next 30 Days,” the applicant should enter the
actual 30-day cost for the household’s basic necessities, such as food, rent, utilities, fuel, etc.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to supply documentation sufficient to verify the
household’s actual expenses. Under the column heading “Allowed Amount,” the
administrator should enter either the actual amount as indicated by the applicant or the
maximum amount for that basic necessity as fixed in the municipal ordinance, whichever is
less.
There is one glaring exception to the general rule that the administrator enter as an “allowed
amount” either the actual 30-day cost or the ordinance maximum, whichever is less. The
exception applies to the food category.
Federal law, at 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b), reads as follows:
“The value of benefits that may be provided (under the Food Stamp program)
shall not be considered income or resources for any purpose under any Federal,
State or local laws, including, but not limited to, laws relating to taxation, welfare,
and public assistance programs, and no participating State or political subdivision
thereof shall decrease any assistance otherwise provided an individual or
individuals because of the receipt of benefits under the chapter.”
Because of this federal law, the GA administrator cannot consider the value of an
applicant’s food supplement benefit when considering how much food assistance should
be budgeted for the applicant. State regulation now parallels the federal law by requiring the
administrator to budget the full food maximum that is a part of the municipal GA ordinance
(DHHS General Assistance Policy Manual, Section IV, “Food”).
The theory behind the federal law is that the food supplement benefit was intended to
supplement and not replace all other existing food programs, and the federal Congress
wanted to avoid the food supplement benefit from becoming the overall food assistance
24
maximum. In any event, to stay on the right side of the federal law and the state regulation,
the administrator must budget the maximum food allowance for all applicants.
Another important exception to the general rule that the applicant is allowed only the lesser
amount between the actual 30-day cost of the basic necessity and the ordinance maximum
applies to applicants receiving federal fuel assistance benefits (HEAP/ECIP). 42 U.S.C.
§ 8624(f) provides that HEAP benefits cannot be considered as “income or resources,” but
case law has interpreted the restriction to mean that eligibility for local assistance must be
determined as though the recipient paid for the HEAP supplied energy.
Accordingly, under the MMA model ordinance, the administrator should enter into the
“allowed amount” column the actual heating fuel costs up to the ordinance maximum for
applicants who just received or are about to receive a HEAP benefit. The administrator can
then reserve the issuance of that amount of assistance until the recipient can demonstrate an
actual need for heating energy assistance.
It is important to note that in addition to the basic application, there is room in the budget
analysis for the administrator to include other expenses to be incurred by the household
which the administrator determines to be essential. For example, some medical expenses,
essential prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs, essential clothing and portions of a
telephone cost (if a telephone is medically necessary) are basic necessities that may be
incurred by the household.
It might also be the case that a household is facing a special expense for goods or services
which are not specifically identified as “basic necessities” in GA law. The GA program is
flexible enough to allow the administrator to consider such an expense a basic necessity, and
budget that expense into the household’s 30-day budget.
The result of the budget process is a “bottom line” calculation of the household “need” over
the next 30-day period. By subtracting from that “need” the household’s income, the
administrator reaches the determination of the household’s unmet need. The unmet need, if it
is less than the applicant’s deficit, is the amount of “regular” or “non-emergency” GA that
can be made available to the household over the 30-day period, in accordance with the
household’s request for assistance.
Example: The following is an example of a budget work up for the hypothetical applicant,
Patricia Flannagan. Pat was divorced recently and lives in Sorrento with her two children,
ages three and five. The only household income is the monthly TANF check of $526. The
25
date of the application is August 15. Pat is able to present adequate documentation to verify
all her claims, and she is not presently in an emergency situation of any kind. Pat is a first
time applicant so the administrator did not require proof of how Pat spent her last month’s
income. The overall maximum level of assistance for a household of three in Hancock
County is $913, and so after subtracting Pat’s income of $493 the administrator determined
Pat’s deficit to be $387.
Pat was instructed to fill out the first column of the application, “Actual Cost for Next 30
Days.” She was asked to put a figure beside each category which represents her actual cost
of the particular basic necessity over the next 30 days. After Pat was finished with this
section of the application, the administrator went over it with her, explaining the reason for
the figures he was entering in the column “Allowed Amount.”
Miscellaneous “Household Composition” Issues
Determining household composition (who is a member of the household for purposes of
GA) is an essential step in calculating eligibility. Although it is one of the easier steps
involved in the GA eligibility calculation process, complications sometimes arise—
especially in an age where the “traditional” family composition is continuously changing.
? Incarceration. Although it may seem obvious, it is worth mentioning that incarcerated
individuals should not be counted as members of a household for purposes of GA.
While in prison they receive all the basic necessities—thus incarcerated family
members have no “needs” relative to GA.
Furthermore, while incarcerated, they are not “shar[ing] a dwelling” with family which is
key to the definition of “household” (§ 4301 (6)) and thus they are not members of the
“household” for the duration of their incarceration.
? Child Custody. Another issue concerns the provision of GA to divorced (or separated)
parents sharing legal custody of a child. In order to determine within which household
the child belongs (for GA household composition purposes), residency is a key factor.
First, should a GA administrator receive information that a child may be living in more than
one home, due for example to a divorce, the administrator should inquire as to where the
child is registered to attend school. Although this may not in every situation reveal the actual
residency of a child, it should generally provide the administrator with pertinent
information.
26
Second, court documents such as “child custody orders” and “custody agreements” should
also provide information as to who has custody of a child and for how many days a week,
etc. If a parent has been given “sole” custody, and the child actually spends most or all of
his/her time with that parent, that custodial parent would be entitled to receive the entire
amount of GA designated for that child.
Note: In such a case, there exists a corresponding presumption that the other parent should
be (or is) contributing child support for the child. If child support is not being received, the
GA applicant as a condition of future eligibility should be made to contact DHHS’s unit of
Child Support Enforcement. Because child support is considered a resource, parents are
obligated to pursue its receipt as a condition of GA eligibility.
Example. Johnny’s parents are divorced. He spends half of the week with mom and half of
the week with dad. Both parents reside in Wayne and he is registered for school in Wayne.
Mom applies for GA and reveals that he lives with his father half of the week. The GA
administrator should provide mom with only half of whatever amount she would otherwise
be entitled to if Johnny were with her full time (i.e., the prorated amount).
Furthermore, since Johnny is under 25 years of age he remains the legal responsibility of
both parents for support, which means the municipality could attempt to collect whatever
funds are expended for Johnny from his father. The administrator should ask the mother
whether she is receiving the child support Johnny’s father has been ordered to pay. If she is
not, she should be required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services
Support Enforcement Unit in order to seek enforcement of the father’s child support
obligation.
Example. Sue’s parents are separated. She spends most of the time at her father’s home in
Augusta and also attends school in Augusta. Sue’s mother lives in Old Orchard Beach. Sue’s
mother applies for GA in Old Orchard Beach. Sue will be visiting her for a weekend
sometime this month. Sue’s mother requests rental assistance because she lives in a onebedroom
apartment and wants to move into a two-bedroom apartment so she can
accommodate her daughter with a bedroom of her own whenever she comes to visit. The
GA administrator is told about the situation and performs the eligibility review based on a
household of one—leaving Sue out of the household composition.
Needless to say, child custody issues relative to GA eligibility must be handled on a case by
case basis. Chances are they will never be as clear cut as the previous examples. However
much living arrangements may seem “untraditional” to administrators, information will
27
have to be objectively analyzed and DHHS or MMA should be called when dealing with
situations which are unclear.
Income
If one half of the “need” analysis concerns the applicant’s overall eligibility as though the
household had access to zero income, the other half concerns the household income
calculation. Since need is determined by considering the applicant’s income, it is important
to understand what is meant by income. The state law defines income as “any form of
income in cash or in kind received by the household.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7). This
definition refers to the net amount of earned income as well as retirement benefits, TANF,
disability insurance, workers compensation benefits, social security income, alimony,
support payments, or other forms of discretionary cash or in-kind contributions that may
come into the household from friends, relatives or any other source.
Excluded Income
There are some forms of income that Congress has expressly prohibited from being
considered as income. These include the food supplement benefit and fuel assistance
benefits (HEAP). Also excluded by federal law is income earned under the Americorp
program and VISTA job-training program. In addition, state law excludes from income
property tax rebates issued under the Maine Residents Property Tax Program (so-called
“Circuit Breaker” program). 36 M.R.S.A. § 6216. Effective August 1, 2013, however, the
Circuit Breaker program was repealed and replaced with the “Property Tax Fairness Credit”
program. Benefits obtained under the new program are counted as income unless used to
provide for basic necessities. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7).
Also excluded are funds from “Family Development Accounts” (known as FDAs). FDAs
are accounts which can hold savings of up to $10,000, and the family can still remain
eligible for GA (in addition to other benefit programs e.g., the food supplement benefit)
provided the funds in FDAs are used only for specific designated purposes such as:
purchasing a car or home, or paying for education, health care, or other things approved by
the Department of Health and Human Services. 10 M.R.S.A. § 1078. The earned income of
any children under 18 years old who are full-time students and are working part-time also
cannot be included as part of the household income. Finally, a person’s tools, such as a
tractor or skidder used to earn a living, cannot be considered assets. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7).
GA law also excludes work-related expenses such as withholding taxes, union dues,
retirement funds, contributions, and reasonable work-related travel expenses and childcare
costs from income. As a result, these items are subtracted from a household’s total income
28
when conducting the GA financial analysis (see MMA’s GA application, line “O” Section
4).
Calculation of Income—Initial Applicants
When determining whether applicants are in need, the administrator should first determine if
the applicant is an initial or repeat applicant. For initial applicants, the administrator should
calculate the applicant’s income for the next 30-day period from the date of application. If
the applicant’s total, prospective 30-day income is more than the total amount needed by the
applicant for the next 30 days, in accordance with the maximum levels of assistance
established by the ordinance, the applicant will not be considered in need. If an initial
applicant received a paycheck two days ago, that money could not be used to calculate need.
Instead, the administrator would add up the amount of paychecks to be received during the
next 30 days. However, if the applicant had any money left over from the last paycheck, that
cash-on-hand would certainly be included as a resource that is available to meet the need.
Applicants are required to use their income for basic necessities and the administrator
should explain this, both orally and in writing, when people first apply.
Example: The Laing family’s only income is its monthly TANF check, and Mrs. Laing is
applying for GA for the first time. The family spent its entire check within the first week,
but not all of the TANF was spent on basic needs. Some was spent on a court fine for an
OUI conviction, and some was spent on an expensive sound system for the family car. At
the time of application, the family needs assistance for heating fuel and personal supplies.
This household would be eligible for some assistance because the total prospective
household income is less than the overall maximum level of assistance allowed in the
ordinance, and the Laings had no money to secure some basic needs. The administrator has
every right to find out how an initial applicant’s previously received income was spent in an
effort to determine that the income is no longer available. What the administrator cannot do
is financially penalize an initial applicant for misspending previously received income. The
financial penalties for misspending income only apply to repeat applicants, as discussed
below.
Calculation of Income—Repeat Applicants
All applicants who are not initial applicants are considered “repeat” applicants. (Remember,
an initial applicant or first time applicant is a person who has never applied for GA
anywhere in the state.) For “repeat” applicants, the administrator should calculate the
prospective 30-day income just as would be done for initial applicants. In addition, the
administrator should also calculate all income received by the household within the last 30
days which was not spent on basic necessities. The income figure used in the calculation of
29
eligibility for repeat applicants is the combination of the income they expect to receive
during the next 30 days plus any “misspent” income they spent during the 30 days before
they applied on items that are not basic necessities. In other words, money that is misspent is
considered available.
The law governing the availability of misspent income (22 M.R.S.A. § 4315-A) warrants
some discussion. To begin with, § 4315-A confers two separate authorities upon
municipalities:
1. The requirement that the municipality consider as available to repeat applicants any
income that was misspent during the 30 days previous to application; and
2. the discretionary authority to establish formal use-of-income guidelines which can be
applied to all GA recipients. As each of these two authorities is distinct and separate,
each is discussed immediately below under separate headings.
The Availability of “Misspent” Income
The first half of § 4315-A reads as follows:
“All persons requesting general assistance must use their income for basic
necessities. Except for initial applicants, recipients are not eligible to receive
assistance to replace income that was spent within the 30-day period prior to the
application on goods or services that are not basic necessities. The income not
spent on goods and services that are basic necessities is considered available to
the applicant.”
There are several aspects to remember about this section of GA law. First, generally
speaking, the determination that misspent income is available to the household applies only
to repeat applicants. This certainly does not mean that an administrator may not inquire
about the manner in which an initial applicant’s recently received income was spent. GA
administrators clearly have the authority to request sufficient evidence to determine if any
GA applicant, initial or subsequent, has any cash on hand. The distinction that is made by
this provision of law between initial and repeat applicants is that for an initial applicant, as
long as his or her recently received income was actually spent, how it was spent would not
affect the initial applicant’s eligibility for non-emergency assistance.
Although there is no legal requirement that applicants must have been given formal notice of
their responsibility to spend their income on basic necessities, it is recommended that
30
administrators notify applicants about this provision as a matter of fairness and municipal
good faith.
Beyond the issue of notice, there remains an issue of municipal discretion. A strict reading
of the law would suggest that municipalities do not have the discretion to ignore or waive a
review and determination of misspent income for any repeat applicant. Administrators may
find in some circumstances that this apparent requirement of law restricts an applicant’s
eligibility for assistance too harshly. After all, the law allows an administrator to “consider”
misspent income as available even when that income is clearly not available to the
household.
By way of illustration, take an “on-again?off-again” applicant who is not an initial
applicant but who has nonetheless not applied for many months or years. A sudden financial
circumstance, such as a layoff, might have caused this applicant to apply for GA, but the
layoff surprised the applicant in such a way that he or she had purchased some nonnecessities
within the past 30 days. Should the administrator, in such a situation, financially
penalize the applicant by considering such “misspent” income as available?
A related issue revolves around the question of what is and what is not an allowable
expenditure of income. There is, after all, a difference between the commodities and
services that an administrator will budget for when determining an applicant’s eligibility for
assistance and the commodities and services that are reasonably necessary for a household to
purchase with its own income. The statute defines the basic necessities, and the MMA
model ordinance now describes some absolute non-necessities (e.g., cable TV,
tobacco/alcohol, etc.).
What about everything in between? Common sense and reason must prevail here. First, all
reasonable and documented expenditures for the statutory basic necessities, up to the
ordinance maximums, must be allowed. Furthermore, all GA administrators have the
discretionary authority to consider any other commodity or service a basic necessity, and
that discretion should be liberally applied when reviewing a household’s expenditures for
the purpose of considering misspent income as available.
For example, a household’s expenditures for liability car insurance or health insurance,
reasonable car payments or licensing/registration expenses where an automobile is
necessary, expenditures for necessary capital improvements, utility or rental security
deposits, property taxes, necessary school supplies, and other reasonably necessary
purchases should be allowed. An administrator may even wish to allow a small percentage
31
of income expenditure (e.g., 10%) for sundry contingencies, without requiring inordinate
verifying documentation.
Proceeding even further with this line of thought, what about household purchases that are
made during the last 30 days for basic necessities, but at levels of expenditure over the
ordinance maximums? If an applicant spent $475 on rent when the ordinance maximum is
$425, should the administrator consider that $50 difference as “available”? Probably not, at
least until the recipient has had an opportunity to look for more affordable housing. But,
what if the applicant has a receipt showing that her entire TANF check of $453 was spent on
food, when the ordinance maximum for food for her family is only $277. Should the
administrator consider the $176 difference as “available”? In this case, such a determination
would be reasonable.
The primary purpose of this provision of law is to provide the administrator with some
satisfaction that the income received during the last 30 days is not still in the applicant’s
pocket. A related purpose is to provide the administrator with some leverage to ensure that
future use-of-income is 1) well documented and 2) directed toward clearly necessary
purposes. To put it another way, the law should not be applied in an overly punitive manner,
but rather as a tool to influence repeat recipients toward appropriate spending habits.
Example 1: Jeremy Bentham receives $312 a month TANF for his 12-year-old son and
regularly applies for GA. On October 15 he applies for assistance and the administrator asks
Jeremy how he spent his October TANF check. Jeremy did not pay his rent or electric bill,
nor did he purchase any fuel oil. In fact, Jeremy is unable to document any expenditures. He
says he bought some food and had to buy some school supplies for his son. The
administrator asked what the school supplies were, where he purchased them, and how much
he spent on those supplies. In response to these questions, Jeremy indicated the expenditure
was only $10. The administrator allows for the $10 school expenditure and a $90
expenditure for food, which represents the ordinance maximum for food for the two weeks
between the receipt of the income and Jeremy’s application. When the $100 allowed
expenditure is subtracted from Jeremy’s October income, it is determined that $212 worth of
Jeremy’s October TANF is considered still available. That “available” income is added (see
Section 4, line N of MMA’s GA application) to his November’s TANF benefit when
determining Jeremy’s income.
Example 2: John Mill applies for GA infrequently. He last applied just before Christmas
last year. In August his hours at work were cut back and in September he applied to the town
for help with his rent. Right after his hours were cut back, John used his last full two-week
32
paycheck to buy a second oil tank and 500 gallons of fuel oil at its low pre-season price.
John thought the 500 gallons of fuel oil could carry him through most of the winter. The
administrator immediately recognized the good sense behind John’s purchase and
considered no previously received income as “available.”
Example 3: Willamena and Henry James apply regularly to the town for help with a variety
of needs for their large family. Willamena receives SSI and Henry works in the woods. They
have six children, and a combined income of $1,000 a month, after Henry’s work-related
expenses are subtracted. The last time the Jameses applied, the administrator took some time
to explain very carefully the applicants’ responsibility to spend their income on basic needs
and document those expenditures. The next time the Jameses applied they were able to show
that they had made their $650 mortgage payment and their $150 payment arrangement with
the utility company, and the rest of the money had gone toward food and household supplies
except for $26 which had been spent on cable television. The administrator had specifically
told Willamena that money spent on cable would not be replaced with general assistance,
and so that $26 was considered available and added to the Jameses prospective income in
the determination of their eligibility. The administrator also considered the fact that both the
mortgage and utility payment arrangement were over the ordinance maximum, but she chose
to allow those expenditures because they were necessary, actually paid, responsibly
documented, and no more cost-effective alternative housing or electric services were
available.
Use-of-Income Guidelines
The second part of 22 M.R.S.A. § 4315-A creates the authority for municipalities to
establish use-of-income guidelines. The law reads:
“A municipality may require recipients to utilize income and resources according
to standards established by the municipality, except that a municipality may not
reduce assistance to a recipient who has exhausted income to purchase basic
necessities. Municipalities shall provide written notice to applicants of the
standards established by the municipalities.”
The use-of-income standards that a municipality may establish under this section of GA law
are simply guidelines developed by the municipality which explain to all GA recipients how
the municipality expects them to spend their income. The law does not require
municipalities to establish these guidelines; it simply authorizes them to do so if they wish.
Rather than dictate the exact form or substance of these use-of-income guidelines, the law
33
allows municipalities to establish their own guidelines which can be more or less specific in
nature according to local policy.
Despite this flexibility allowed by the law, there are a few limitations imposed on a
municipality’s use-of-income guidelines:
? The municipal guidelines may not establish standards of eligibility which are more
restrictive than the standards of eligibility established by state law;
? If a municipality wishes to establish use-of-income guidelines, a written notice
detailing the guidelines must be provided to all GA applicants;
? Even when a recipient spends his or her income in a manner contrary to the municipal
guidelines, the administrator cannot penalize that recipient by reducing his or her
assistance if the recipient actually exhausted the household income on basic necessities.
For example, let us suppose that the town of Sabattus has a policy that requires GA
recipients to pay their rent with household income. Oskar Petersen, a regular GA applicant
who was well aware of the Sabattus use-of-income policy, applies to the town for help with
his rent. The administrator asks Oskar how he spent his recently received pension check, and
Oskar provides receipts showing that he used his whole check to buy some fuel, pay his light
bill, and purchase some groceries. Oskar would remain eligible for GA for his rent, even
though he violated the town’s use-of-income guidelines, because he had in fact exhausted
his income on basic necessities. Even if Oskar had no good reason (i.e., “just cause”) not to
pay his rent first, Sabattus could not penalize him for making the financial decisions he did.
The law, which allows municipalities to establish use-of-income standards, makes it clear
that such standards are merely guidelines. A municipality’s use-of-income guidelines do not,
in themselves, carry the force of eligibility standards.
Since the law allows a municipality to establish its own use-of-income standards, there
could eventually be developed a great number of unique and effective standards. As
examples of the variety of guidelines a municipality might consider, three sample “use-ofincome”
model policies can be found at Appendix 4: the use-of-income policy which is part
of MMA’s model GA ordinance, and the policies of the City of Augusta and the Town of
Wells. These three samples represent a spectrum of policy-making possibility.
The policy established by MMA’s model ordinance simply informs all applicants of their
obligation to spend their money responsibly, and reserves the municipality’s right to
specifically direct a recipient’s use-of-income when and if that recipient demonstrates an
34
inability or unwillingness to make responsible financial decisions or accurately document
household expenditures. The policy behind the MMA model ordinance language is to not
make financial decisions for a GA recipient unless it becomes clear that the recipient cannot
or will not make appropriate and responsible financial decisions for him or herself.
The Augusta use-of-income policy directs all applicants to exhaust their income on their
basic needs, and those needs are ranked in an order of priority, starting with rent/housing
needs and proceeding through energy needs (fuel oil, electricity), personal care, food and an
“other” category. By these guidelines, a recipient of GA who has an income of $500 per
month would be required to, if nothing else, pay the rent. If after the rent obligation was
taken care of there is income left over, that income must be used to pay the electric bill or
purchase fuel oil, and so on. Whenever an applicant applies for assistance in Augusta
(excepting initial applicants), he or she must demonstrate that the household income was
spent according to this priority list.
Unlike the MMA use-of-income policy, the Augusta standards are uniformly applied to all
repeat applicants without consideration of their previous financial behaviors. The Augusta
director finds that the City’s policy: 1) encourages Augusta recipients towards improved
management of their financial resources; 2) reduces the need to issue emergency assistance,
especially to stop evictions or utility disconnections; and 3) simplifies the process of
verifying eligibility, both for the City and recipients, by clearly establishing what receipts or
other paperwork the recipient must bring in whenever he or she next applies.
The policy of the Town of Wells falls somewhere in between Augusta’s policy and MMA’s.
Just like the Augusta sample, the Wells requirements direct all applicants to spend a
percentage of their income toward specific basic needs, which are listed in an order of
priority. Unlike the Augusta requirements, however, the Wells guidelines do not require an
exhaustion of income. For example, GA recipients who have an income of approximately
$350 are required to direct approximately $280 of that income (80%) toward their rent. The
rest of the household income must be spent on basic needs, but recipients are allowed to
spend that money with some discretion. The policy behind this approach appears to
recognize a balance between the municipality’s interest in ensuring that applicants meet as
much of their financial obligation as possible and the recipients’ interest in having some
income on hand to meet day-to-day contingencies.
If it is agreed that use-of-income guidelines are a good idea and worth the administrative
effort, GA administrators, under the direction of their municipal officers, should feel free to
develop a set of standards they are entirely comfortable with. Whatever form the guidelines
35
take, care should be taken to word the written notice describing the guidelines in such a way
that applicants are not misled into thinking that failure to conform to the use-of-income
requirements would automatically result in their ineligibility for GA. One way to accomplish
this would be to simply restate the provision of law to read something to the effect:
“Nothing in these guidelines permits the administrator to reduce assistance to a recipient
who has exhausted his or her income to purchase basic necessities.”
Lump Sum Income
As discussed above, the analysis of income for the purpose of determining eligibility is
generally prospective; the administrator calculates from the best available information what
the household income will be for the next 30 days, and any surplus income in that 30-day
period cannot be rolled over into a subsequent 30-day period. In 1990, the Legislature
amended the definition of “income” (§ 4301(7)) to allow an exception to this general rule.
This exception applies when a repeat GA applicant receives a lump sum payment.
A lump sum payment is defined at § 4301(8-A) as essentially a one-time, windfall payment
received prior or subsequent to applying for assistance. Examples of lump sum payments
would include retroactive SSI payments, workers’ compensation settlements, inheritances,
lottery winnings, etc. The 1990 amendment to the statutory definition of GA income allows
administrators to consider lump sum payments received by repeat GA applicants as
available to the applicant-household for periods longer than 30 days in certain carefully
controlled circumstances. The process of spreading out a lump sum payment over an
extended period of time and presuming it to be available is called lump sum proration. In
2002 the Legislature amended § 4301(8-A) and § 4308 to explicitly exclude “first time”
applicants from this lump sum payment rule. 22. M.R.S.A. § 4308(3). The lump sum
proration process is also found in the TANF program. A TANF recipient who receives a
lump sum payment can expect to be disqualified from receiving TANF for a period of
months equal to the lump sum payment, less “disregards,” divided by the applicant’s
monthly benefit. In keeping with the fact that GA is a final safety net program, the GA lump
sum proration process does not exactly resemble the TANF process.
To correctly prorate a GA applicant’s lump sum income, a number of steps have to be
followed:
Step #1—Lump Sum Proration: Initial
As discussed immediately above, lump sum proration is a procedure that cannot be applied
to initial applicants. This does not mean that lump sum payments received by initial
applicants must be completely ignored. If it is determined that an initial applicant received a
36
large, lump sum payment in the recent past, the administrator has every right to learn what
was done with that money in order to determine:
1. that no amount of the lump sum payment is still available; and
2. if some of the lump sum payment was converted into an unnecessary tangible asset that
can be reconverted to cash.
The administrator cannot go beyond these inquiries when dealing with lump sum payments
received by initial applicants.
It should also be noted that the law formerly required that all recipients be given formal
notice of the municipality’s authority to prorate lump sum payments. Under that original
wording of the law, a lump sum proration could not be applied even to a repeat applicant if
that repeat applicant had not received written notice of the municipality’s authority to
prorate prior to receiving the lump sum payment. The requirement of written notice has been
removed from the lump sum proration statute.
Even though the lump sum notice provision has been removed as a strict requirement of GA
law, all MMA Notice of Eligibility forms contain a lump sum proration notice. As a matter
of municipal good faith, any municipality not using MMA forms should consider informing
all applicants, both orally and in writing, of the lump sum proration process and the
applicants’ responsibility to spend any lump sum income on basic necessities. Applicants
should also be advised to document those expenditures if they wish to protect their GA
eligibility.
Step #2—Lump Sum Proration: Disregards
In the event a repeat GA applicant receives a lump sum payment, the administrator must
evaluate how much of that lump sum payment is “pro-ratable”; that is, what portion of the
lump sum payment must be disregarded before the remainder is prorated over future 30-day
periods. There are three reasons to disregard (i.e., not prorate) some or all of a lump sum
payment:
1. Any part of the lump sum income which can be documented as a “required payment”
must be disregarded. A required payment would be any part of the lump sum payment
which is designated to another person, typically to pay outstanding legal or medical fees,
as a condition of receipt of the lump sum payment.
37
2. Any part of the lump sum payment which is spent or has been spent for basic necessities
must be disregarded. It is this part of the disregard process which will call upon an
administrator’s common sense, good judgment, and ability to reasonably construe what
is and what is not a “basic necessity.” For example, if an applicant’s house or car falls
into disrepair while he or she is waiting for an SSI decision, and that applicant ultimately
receives a retroactive SSI check, the administrator should consider reasonable repairs to
the house or car as legitimate expenditures to purchase or secure the applicant’s shelter
and transportation. Any amount of the lump sum payment used for documented
expenditures such as these should be disregarded.
On the other hand, the repair and maintenance of a shelter is very different from an
expansion or remodeling project, and mechanical repair to a necessary automobile is
very different from a new paint job. In accordance with the general rule in GA that all
household income must be used for basic needs, the applicant should be able to provide
reasonable justification for all expenses made out of the lump sum payment.
Also, GA law details some particular expenditures made with lump sum proceeds that
are allowed, that is, excluded from the lump sum payment for the purpose of proration
assessment. These specific expenditures are: payment of funeral or burial expenses for a
family member; travel costs related to the illness or death of a family member; repair or
replacement of essentials lost due to fire, flood or other natural disaster; repair or
purchase of a motor vehicle essential for employment, education, training or other dayto-
day living necessities; repayments of loans or credit used for basic necessities; or
payment of bills earmarked for the purpose for which the lump sum is paid. 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4301 (7).
3. Lump sum payments which represent a “converted asset” must be disregarded in their
entirety if the recipient has replaced the asset or intends to replace the asset, or otherwise
uses the converted asset for necessary expenses. The primary example of a “converted
asset” is an insurance payment for destroyed or damaged property. If a GA applicant’s
house sustains a fire, and the applicant subsequently receives a $10,000 insurance
payment, that $10,000 is a converted asset rather than income. Consequently, it may not
be prorated as lump sum “income,” unless the applicant chooses to use it as income by
not replacing the asset or diverting the liquefied asset into other necessary expenses.
Step #3—Lump Sum Proration: Income Add-Backs
After all the required payments and legitimate disregards have been subtracted from the
original lump sum payment, the administrator should then add to that subtotal all the regular
income the household has received between the receipt of the lump sum payment and the
38
time of application for GA. For example, if an applicant received an SSI retroactive payment
of $9,000 six months ago, and since that time has been receiving $434 a month as an SSI
benefit, the administrator would first determine how much of the lump sum payment was
spent as required payments or legitimate disregards and then subtract that amount from the
original $9,000. At this point in the calculation, the administrator would add back to this
new subtotal the sum of $2,604 (6 x $434), which represents subsequently received income.
Step #4—Lump Sum: Period of Proration
Once all the disregards have been determined and the subsequently received regular income
has been added back in, the remaining subtotal may be prorated. The period of proration is
achieved by dividing the proratable portion of the lump sum payment by the verified actual
monthly amounts for all the household’s basic necessities. The result of this division will
yield the number of months for which it would be reasonable to expect the household to
have sufficient income to purchase basic necessities. The law, however, requires that no
period of proration shall exceed 12 months.
Therefore, if the result of dividing the pro-ratable lump sum income by the household’s
maximum need is less than 12, that result shall be the period of proration. If the result is
12 or greater, the period of proration shall be no more than 12 months from the date of that
GA application. In either circumstance, the period of proration begins when the applicant
received the lump sum payment. The period of proration is the heart of the lump sum rule.
During the period of proration, the administrator may consider as available to the household
a sufficient income, and the household would not be eligible for GA.
Step #5—Lump Sum: Emergency Assistance
It used to be the case that the provisions of law governing the lump sum proration process
clearly stated that applicants remain eligible for emergency GA even during a period of
proration. That is no longer the case. As of 1993, the so-called “emergency override”
provision was removed from Lump Sum proration law. This means that a household will not
be eligible for either “regular” or “emergency” GA during a period of proration, unless
they can establish additional eligibility (e.g., for a change in household composition).
However, as of July 25, 2002, notwithstanding the foregoing, the household or initial
applicant that is otherwise eligible for emergency assistance may not be denied emergency
assistance to meet an immediate need solely on the basis of the proration of a lump sum
payment. Upon subsequent applications, that household’s eligibility is subject to the
foregoing.
39
Example: Heidi Hegel, her husband and two children live in North Berwick. A year ago
Heidi lost her job due to a work-related injury, and she has since been receiving a monthly
workers’ compensation income of $700. Her husband sought work but his efforts proved
unsuccessful. The overall maximum level of assistance for Heidi’s household is $799 for a
30-day period, and so the household’s deficit was $99 per month. Since Heidi’s injury,
either she or her husband regularly applied for the GA the household needed. A few months
ago, Heidi received a surprise inheritance of $7,500. For three months after receiving the
inheritance Heidi had no need for GA and did not apply. Unfortunately, during the time she
was out on workers’ compensation, Heidi got far behind on some of her bills. To make
matters worse, during this period of time Heidi’s septic system failed and she had to spend
$5,000 for a replacement system. All in all, Heidi found out that the $7,500 didn’t last as
long as she had expected it to. Three months after receiving the inheritance, Heidi had to
apply for GA again. When Heidi first applied for GA, prior to receiving the inheritance, she
had been informed of the lump sum proration process, and so she had kept a good account of
her expenditures. The administrator reviewed the documentation Heidi provided and
determined that Heidi’s use of the lump sum payment was for necessary expenses, and there
was no proration.
Example: Katy Drew and her two kids received $418 a month from TANF until Katy
received $3,000 in Lottery winnings. TANF immediately disqualified Katy for seven months
because of the lump sum payment, and so Katy applied to her local GA office for assistance,
claiming that she had lost the $3,000 right after cashing the Lottery check. The administrator
reviewed the law and divided the overall maximum level of assistance designated for the
household—$670—into the lump sum payment of $3,000. The administrator’s decision was
that Katy was ineligible for GA for 4 1/2 months. The proration was correctly calculated
because no part of the lump sum payment was a required deduction or spent in such a way
that it should have been disregarded for the purposes of proration.
Income–Other Issues
Net vs. Gross Income
For the purpose of determining an applicant’s income, the administrator should use net
income only. At § 4301(7), GA law prohibits taxes, retirement fund contributions and union
dues from being considered as income, and so the standard FICA/Social Security deductions
from gross pay cannot be considered as income for the purposes of determining GA
eligibility. Some employees make voluntary arrangements with their employers to have
additional sums deducted from their paycheck for certain purposes. These non-mandatory
deductions should be reviewed by the administrator and when the income deducted would
40
be more appropriately devoted to the applicant’s basic needs, the applicant should be
directed in writing to secure the deducted income as a potential resource (see “Use of
Potential Resources,” in Chapter 3 ).
Work-Related Expenses
In addition to standard payroll deductions, § 4301(7) prohibits the administrator from
considering transportation costs to and from work, special equipment costs and work-related
child care expenses as “income.” For this reason, it is necessary for the administrator to add
a step in the income calculation process which identifies the actual work-travel, work
equipment and work-related child care expenses and deducts that sum from the income subtotal.
MMA’s model application forms provide a line in the income calculation section for
that purpose. When the applicant is not employed but is actively seeking employment, the
actual and reasonably necessary job-search costs should also be deducted from income.
Irregular Income
Sometimes it will be difficult to determine the applicant’s monthly income because of the
nature of his or her work. Self-employment; piece work employment; the many people in
Maine who harvest natural resources such as digging for clams or worms or working in the
woods; people who work variable hours, on-call, seasonal work, or work that is available
only in good weather—all these situations can make it very difficult to pinpoint a 30-day
prospective income.
In these situations, the administrator may review the applicant’s previously received income
to get an idea of what the average earnings are and what could reasonably be projected as
prospective earnings. This calculation might require contacting persons with whom the
applicant does business, such as the paper mill or the wholesalers purchasing the harvested
marine products, to verify any applicant claims of short-term limited markets. In cases such
as these, it would probably be wise to have the applicants apply for GA on a weekly basis in
order to make any necessary adjustments as a result of the income actually received.
Self-Employment Income
It is not unusual for a self-employed applicant to claim a significant offset of work-related
costs against income received. If the applicant’s business is doing particularly poorly, the
costs of doing business will allegedly be greater than the income actually received. The GA
program, however, is not a subsidy program for small business. It is also not the case that
the GA program is designed to perform sophisticated analyses of profitability or
capitalization efficiencies.
41
Against the actual income received by self-employed applicants, the administrator should
only deduct the expenses that were actually incurred as a result of producing the income if
those expenses have been paid or need to be immediately paid by the applicant during the
30-day income projection period. If the applicant’s business is not producing at least a
minimum-wage income, the applicant should be required to perform workfare for the
municipality or make a good faith effort to secure bona fide employment, or both.
Income from Household Members
One circumstance that causes confusion in the attempt to determine eligibility is when a
person applies for GA and it is determined that the applicant is living in the same dwelling
unit with other people who are not members of the applicant’s household. In this
circumstance, whose income and whose 30-day needs are used in the calculation of
eligibility? The answer to this question turns on the determination of whether the various
people living in the dwelling unit are pooling or not pooling their respective incomes.
? Pooled Income. If the people living in dwelling unit pool their income, that is, comingle
their funds and mutually share both incomes (to the extent it is available) and
expenses, as would a family, then the members are treated as one household and all
income is included when determining eligibility. In other words, “pooling” means the
actual household expenses are shared with some degree of overlap between household
members, for instance one person pays the rent and fuel while the other pays for the
food, light bill, etc.
“Pooling of income” is defined in GA law as follows:
“Pooling of income” means the financial relationship among household members who are
not legally liable for mutual support in which there occurs any commingling of funds or
sharing of income or expenses. Municipalities may by ordinance establish as a rebuttable
presumption that persons sharing the same dwelling unit are pooling their income.
Applicants who are requesting that the determination of eligibility be calculated as though
one or more household members are not pooling their income have the burden of rebutting
the presumption of pooling income.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(12-A).
This definition establishes a shifting of the burden of proof from the municipality to the
applicant. By ordinance, the municipality can assert the presumption of pooling and
establish guidelines whereby applicants can rebut the presumption. MMA’s model GA
ordinance contains some language to this effect. When an applicant wants to rebut the
presumption of pooling, the applicant should bring documentation, such as receipts, banking
42
records, and landlord or other vendor agreements that clearly show the applicant has been
and is currently solely and entirely responsible for his or her pro rata share of the household
expenses.
Other circumstances to review when attempting to evaluate whether the household is
pooling income would be the nature of the relationship between the alleged roommates. Are
the roommates related? Do they share property or bank accounts? Does the municipality
have any compelling evidence to assert the existence of a close personal relationship? These
are findings that could be relied upon to reject an attempt by an applicant to rebut the
statutory presumption of pooling.
Legally Liable Relatives
Prior to September 30, 1989, all parents and grandparents living or owning property in
Maine were financially responsible for the support of their children and grandchildren.
Legislation passed in 1989 limited that financial liability to parents of children under the age
of 21. In 1993, the law was again amended to clarify that grandparents have no financial
obligation to support their grandchildren. However, the parental obligation to support (at
least with regard to the GA program) remains until the parent’s child is 25 years of age.
Because the statute makes no exceptions for emancipated minors, it is MMA Legal
Services’ opinion that the 25-year of age rule applies even in cases of emancipation.
Therefore, if an applicant is 25 years of age or older and still living with his/her parents, the
administrator cannot automatically evaluate the entire household as a whole family unit
without employing the presumption of pooling as discussed immediately above.
Most administrators recognize that the parents and siblings of adults sometimes have limited
willingness to provide long-term, continuing support to roommate family members. When
people are living with relatives who they have no legal liability to support, it is clearly
possible that the applicant is seeking assistance for only him/herself and is not pooling
income with his/her parents or siblings. If such an applicant is applying for GA while
intending to keep living with relatives, he or she could have a tougher burden of rebutting
the statutory presumption of pooling.
It is more typical, however, for applicants in this circumstance to apply for assistance for the
purposes of moving to alternative housing. In such a case, since parents have no legal
obligation to support their adult children who are 25 years old or older, it is often the case
that relocation assistance is supplied before the supportive family members go to the trouble
of kicking their relatives out onto the street.
43
If the members of the household are legally liable for the support of each other (parents for
children under the age of 25; spouses for each other), the income of all members of the
household must be considered when determining eligibility. The broader issue of
determining the eligibility of minors who are applying independently for assistance is taken
up below, under “Liability of Relatives.”
Roommates
Against the presumption of pooling that is now part of GA law, there is obvious fact that
some people are living together merely as roommates. When members of the household are
not legally liable for each other and they do not pool their income or share expenses, they
are considered to be roommates. In a roommate situation only the applicant’s income and his
or her pro rata share of the household expenses can be considered in the calculation of
eligibility. The administrator cannot include the income of the roommate who is not
applying for GA. Similarly, the administrator should not consider or subsidize the nonapplicant
roommate’s pro rata share of the household expenses.
GA law, at the definition of “household” (§ 4301(6)), expressly provides that when an
applicant shares a dwelling unit with one or more individuals, even when a landlord-tenant
relationship may exist between them, eligible applicants may receive assistance for no more
than their pro rata share of the actual costs of the shared basic needs of that household. For
instance if there were two roommates and one applied for GA, consider 100% of the
applicant’s income but 1/2 of the shared household expenses: three roommates, consider
100% of the applicant’s income but 1/3 of the shared household expenses; four roommates,
1/4 of the shared expenses, and so on.
Example: Four roommates share a house in Sullivan. Three roommates earn more than
enough money to pay their expenses. However, one roommate, Bernard, only receives $300
a month in unemployment compensation. The overall maximum for Bernard, by ordinance,
is $363, so Bernard’s deficit is $63. With regard to Bernard’s unmet need, the calculation is
as follows:
For a household of four (4), the GA ordinance allows the following monthly maximums:
Rent (heated) $ 592
Utilities 70
Food 426
Personal supplies 35
Total $1,123
44
Bernard’s share is 1/4 of $1,123 or $281. Because his income is more than his need ($300
minus $281 provides a surplus of $19) and his income exceeds the allowed maximum for his
pro rata share (1/4), he is not eligible for GA.
When taking this application the administrator should consider the applicant a household of
one, even though there were three other people, because the other three were not applying
for assistance since they had adequate income. However, if they pooled their income the
administrator should consider it a household of four and all income should be considered.
Rental Payments to Private Homes
Sometimes people apply for rental assistance and their “landlord” lives in the same house or
apartment as the GA applicant. The applicant’s eligibility for rent in this circumstance is
often questioned by GA administrators because of the possibility that the relationship
between the homeowner and the tenant is not really a landlord-tenant relationship, the rate of
rent being charged is out of proportion with regard to the actual shelter cost, or the rent is
merely being requested for the purposes of generating an income which would not exist
except for the availability of GA funding.
The statutory definition of “household” (§ 4301(6)) addresses this scenario. The pertinent
part of the definition reads:
“When an applicant shares a dwelling unit with one or more individuals, even when
a landlord-tenant relationship may exist between individuals residing in the dwelling
unit, eligible applicants may receive assistance for no more than their pro rata share
of the actual costs of the shared basic needs of that household according to the
maximum levels of assistance established in the municipal ordinance.”
A plain reading of this language reveals the manner in which the cost of the applicant’s
housing expenditures are determined when: (1) a number of people are living under the
same roof; (2) there is no pooling of income; and (3) not all household members are
applying for assistance. Simply stated, eligibility is determined by budgeting the applicant’s
expenses as his or her proportionate share of the actual, shared household expenses. This
calculation of the applicant’s prorated housing costs applies even when the applicant claims
to owe a rental payment to another person in the household.
Example: Marsden Hartley applied for assistance in Georgetown. Marsden claimed that he
must pay his roommate $300 a month rent for his room in the mobile home. The rent covers
heating and utility costs. Marsden is responsible for buying his food and personal supplies,
45
and so he also asked for his full food and personal care allowance. Marsden’s total request is
for $450 worth of GA. The Georgetown administrator explained the law to Marsden and
asked for documentation describing the entire household’s actual 30-day costs; namely, the
total rent or mortgage costs for the mobile home, the total electric bill and the total need for
heating fuel over the next 30-day period. Marsden’s roommate did not want to provide that
information, but reluctantly demonstrated that the actual rent the roommate had to pay to a
third-party landlord was only $150. The 30-day electric bill was $40, and the mobile home’s
fuel tank was topped off just a few days before Marsden applied for GA. Based on this
information, the administrator (using MMA’s GA Application (Section 6)) calculated
Marsden’s 30-day need as:
6. Expenses
MONTHLY EXPENSES
ACTUAL COST
FOR NEXT
30 DAYS

1. Food $ 112 $ 112

5. LP Gas $ ---- $ ----
6. Heating TYPE: (i.e., oil, electricity, etc.) $ ---- $ ----
7. Household/Personal Supplies $ 30 $ 30
8. Other Basic Needs (please specify) $ ---- $ ----

TOTAL MONTHLY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES: $ 332 $ 237
Because Marsden had zero income, the administrator calculated his 30-day need as $237.
The administrator then noted that the overall maximum level of assistance for which
Marsden was eligible (household of one in Sagadahoc County) was $424. With a deficit of
$424 and an unmet need of $237, the administrator correctly found Marsden to be eligible
for $237 worth of GA over the next 30-day period.
The final question facing the administrator in this case was to whom the GA should be
issued. The administrator did not feel it appropriate to issue money to Marsden’s roommate
just on the claim that he was Marsden’s landlord, especially where the roommate had no
ownership interest in the mobile home. Accordingly, the administrator issued Marsden’s
share of the rent to the actual landlord, who did not live in the mobile home. The GA
Marsden needed for electricity was issued to the utility company under the roommate’s
account number.
46
Although in this case the administrator chose not to issue Marsden’s GA to his
roommate/landlord, in special cases the administrator may issue a housing cost payment on
behalf of an applicant to another person acting as landlord who lives in the same dwelling
unit as the applicant. Under such circumstances, criteria to be considered include:
1. The applicant and the landlord are not pooling income or resources. If it is found
that they are pooling income, the administrator will determine the need of the entire
household.
2. The landlord has legal interest in the property. If the landlord has neither legal,
equity nor tenancy interest in the property, no rental payment should be issued to that
landlord or to any third party on his or her behalf. If the landlord has only equity interest
in the property, the rental payment, if issued, will not be issued to him or her, but only to
the party with legal interest. If the landlord has only tenancy interest in the property, the
rental payment, if issued, should be issued only to the party who has a superior legal or
equity interest in the property.
3. The rental arrangement is not being created for the sole purpose of eliciting general
assistance as income to the landlord. Evidence supporting this finding could include the
rental cost of the property as compared to fair market value; the rental cost of the
property as compared to the applicant’s pro rata share of the entire shelter cost; the
landlord’s history of renting the property; ties of consanguinity or affinity between the
landlord and the tenant, etc. (See also discussion below regarding “Rental Payments to
Relatives.”)
When an owner of a private home regularly receives rental payments from the municipality
on behalf of applicants renting rooms from that private home, the municipality may require
that landlord to make a good faith effort to obtain a lodging license from the Department of
Health and Human Services, Division of Health Engineering, pursuant to 10-144 A Code of
Maine Regulations, Chapter 201, as a condition of that landlord receiving future general
assistance payments on behalf of his or her tenants.
Rental Payments to Relatives
The municipality is not required to issue rental payments to an applicant’s relatives.
However the municipality may decide to do so if the following criteria has been met; the
rental relationship has existed for at least three months; and the applicant’s relative(s) rely
on the rental payment for their basic needs. In other words, if the relatives are in a
financial situation whereby they need the GA benefit to assist with basic necessities
provided to the GA applicant/recipient, the municipality may decide to issue the general
47
assistance despite the fact they are living with a family member. For the purpose of this
section, a “relative” is defined as the applicant’s parents, grandparents, children,
grandchildren, siblings, parent’s siblings, or any of those relatives’ children. 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4319(2).
Sometimes providing assistance to a relative is actually the most cost-effective way to
provide an eligible applicant with basic necessities and as such this is an option to explore.
Note: A similar analysis to the one above regarding rental payment to private homes should
be considered by the GA administrator.
Example: Adrian Hart is recently divorced, is currently unemployed and needs a place to
stay. He has been searching for employment but his job skills are poor and he is having a
difficult time finding employment. Adrian has been living with his aunt but since she is
elderly and on a very limited income she can no longer afford to give Adrian a free place to
stay. Adrian’s aunt has agreed that for $200 a month, he can stay with her. Adrian is found
eligible to receive $381 in GA benefits. Because Adrian is eligible for more than the cost of
room and board at the aunt’s home, he has been living at the aunt’s home for over three
months, and because the aunt’s income is such that she requires the assistance to provide the
household with basic necessities, the municipality could consider providing the $200 to
Adrian so that he can continue to live with his aunt.
Of course in the above example, the municipality could perform a GA analysis based on a
household of two, which will usually lower the entitlement amount (the entitlement amount
is always less for a household of two than it is for two separate individuals). However, in a
case where there is the flexibility such as here, providing the full $200 is still $181 less than
what Adrian is eligible for—and if it keeps him housed and fed it may be the best option.
This would certainly be more cost effective than having him move out of the aunt’s home
(because she cannot or does not want to keep him for less than $200) and then have to
provide him with his full eligibility amount of $381.
Rental Payments to Landlords—IRS Regulations
When the municipality issues in aggregate more than $600 in rental payments to any
landlord in any calendar year, a 1099 form declaring the total amount of rental payments
issued during the calendar year must be provided to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
pursuant to IRS regulation. See Title 26 Section 6041(a) of Internal Revenue Code.
48
Assets
In addition to calculating income, the administrator must take into consideration (using
MMA’s GA application, Section 5) whether the applicant has any personal property or
assets such as recreation vehicles, boats, real estate, a life insurance policy, or stocks or
bonds. In order to ever enforce a requirement of asset liquidation imposed on a recipient, the
administrator must give the applicant written notice that he or she must attempt in good faith
to sell or liquidate the assets in order to receive assistance in the future.
MMA’s model GA ordinance provides that recipients are allowed to keep one car if it is
needed for transportation to work or for medical reasons, provided the market value of the
automobile is not greater than $8,000. Also, if there are other unnecessary assets which
could be liquidated to meet the applicants’ need in a timely manner, the administrator can
deny all or part of the request and inform the applicants to use the resources to reduce their
need. If, on the other hand, the applicant’s assets would take some time to liquidate,
assistance would be granted for an interim period, and the applicant would be expressly
required to liquidate the assets by a time certain in order to be eligible for assistance after
that date.
Another matter that is left to the discretion of local officials is the ownership of real estate. If
applicants own real estate, other than a home that is occupied as their residence, the
municipality may limit ongoing assistance if the applicants refuse to sell the property at its
fair market value so that the proceeds can be used to meet the household’s expenses.
Municipalities may also consider adopting language in their ordinances (MMA’s model
ordinance currently contains such language at section 5.4) establishing a maximum size of
land (lot size) for a primary residence above which the excess will be viewed as an
available asset (resource) if certain conditions are met. The conditions included in MMA’s
model GA ordinance (amongst other things) are that:
1. The applicant has received General Assistance for the last 120 consecutive days; and
2. The applicant has the legal right to sell the land (e.g., any mortgagee will release any
mortgage, any co-owners agree to the sale, zoning or other land use laws do not render
the sale illegal or impracticable); and
3. The applicant has the financial capability to put the land into a marketable condition
(e.g. the applicant can pay for any necessary surveys); and
4. The land is not utilized for the maintenance and/or support of the household; and
49
5. A knowledgeable source (e.g., a realtor) indicates that the land in question can be sold at
fair market value, for an amount which will aid the applicant’s financial rehabilitation;
and
6. No other circumstances exist which cause any sale to be unduly burdensome or
inequitable.
NOTE: In the event a municipality wishes to adopt a maximum size of land (lot size)
requirement, other than the one found in MMA’s GA ordinance at section 5.4, they should
first contact MMA Legal Services to discuss the matter thoroughly.
MMA’s model language would provide for the following result: If a GA applicant (who had
received GA for at least 120 consecutive days) owned a home on a 12-acre lot of land in an
area where the minimum lot size due to the municipality’s zoning ordinance was two acres,
and the client met all six criteria, the GA recipient could be made to place the additional ten
acres up for sale (at fair market value) while receiving GA. Furthermore, under MMA’s
model, once the applicant ceases to receive assistance the obligations under section 5.4 also
cease. Assessor’s cards on the property at issue should be consulted in order to ascertain
necessary information relative to the property at issue.
Expenses
Another critical part of the application process concerns the calculation of an applicant’s
monthly expenses. Using MMA’s GA application form (Section 6), the following serves to
illustrate the manner by which “expenses” are calculated.

50
Food:
Under the food category, Pat Johnston had figured the family’s 30-day need to be around
$100 more than the food supplement benefit they received. The administrator indicated that
according to GA rules, the food supplement benefit was not counted as income and budgeted
in the full $335 maximum eligibility according to his ordinance.
Rent:
Under the rent category, Pat put down her actual monthly rent cost of $475, but the
administrator explained that he could only budget $379 in that category, because that was
the maximum rent for a three-bedroom dwelling unit allowed by his ordinance.
Utilities:
Pat had been using some electric space heaters during the winter and so her electricity bill
over the last few months was running about $80. The administrator explained that the utility
maximums in the ordinance were not seasonally adjusted, and so he could only budget in the
ordinance maximum of $70 for utility costs for a family of three.
Heating Fuel:
Pat didn’t really know exactly how much heating fuel she would need in the month of April,
but estimated that she would need at least 200 gallons to fill her tank, and fuel was running
at about $2.00 per gallon. Since the actual heating cost was unknown, the administrator
budgeted in the ordinance maximum of 125 gallons at $2.00/gallon, or $250.00.
Household/Personal Supplies:
Pat did not really know what type of commodities this category included, so she put down
$20 as a guess. The administrator explained that the category was meant to include such
items as kitchen, bathroom and laundry supplies. Pat and the administrator agreed that Pat
would easily be spending up to the ordinance maximum of $40 in this category.
Telephone:
Pat entered $40 under the “other” category for her phone bill. The administrator asked
whether someone in Pat’s household was medically unstable enough to require a telephone
for medical emergencies. Pat said that her three-year old was seeing a doctor regularly for
asthma problems. The administrator explained that he could only budget in the cost for basic
phone service, which was $13.50 after considering the $10.50 per month “lifeline” phone
bill benefit Pat was receiving through her telephone company.
51
Transportation:
The only additional cost Pat thought she could include was her monthly car payment of
$250. Pat’s husband had purchased the car on installment payments shortly before their
divorce, and Pat received her car in the divorce settlement, except she had to take over the
payments. The administrator explained that since Pat was unemployed, the car payment was
not an allowed expense but that he could budget in the cost of “necessary” medical travel
expenses at the rate of $.28 per mile. The administrator calculated Pat would be traveling
120 miles monthly to bring her child to “necessary” medical appointments and so budgeted
in a transportation cost of $33.60 (120 x $.28). He informed Pat that the next time she
applied she would have to bring in statements from the doctor that Pat had to make the
weekly trips to the doctor as a medical necessity.
Child Care:
When Pat prepared her budget, she included the $10 per week cost of putting her two
children in a day care center for a couple of hours a week. Because this cost was not a workrelated
expense, the administrator did not deduct this amount from her net income. If Pat had
to use the childcare facility so that she could work, the related cost would be subtracted
directly from Pat’s income.
Once the budget has been completed, and the income is known, the determination can be
made of the household’s “deficit” and “unmet need.”
Deficit & Unmet Need
The Deficit & Unmet Need Tests—A Summary
Two tests exist for calculating GA eligibility: the deficit test and the unmet need test. The
deficit is simply the difference between the applicant’s income and the appropriate overall
maximum level of assistance for a household of the applicant’s size. The values for overall
maximum levels of assistance are found at Appendix A to MMA’s model General
Assistance ordinance.
No applicant is automatically eligible for his or her deficit. The administrator should also
calculate the applicant’s unmet need, which is the second eligibility test. The unmet need is
the difference between the applicant’s income and that household’s 30-day need, which is
determined by calculating the household budget, as described above.
52
The applicant will be eligible for only the smaller value between the deficit and the unmet
need. No more assistance for that period of eligibility will be available to the applicant
unless an emergency exists and the applicant is eligible for emergency assistance.
The administrator should be sensitive to the actual needs of an applying household where
there is a large disparity between the applicant’s deficit and unmet need, particularly during
the heating season. The deficit is based on a somewhat arbitrary number. The unmet need, if
calculated correctly, is a much more accurate indicator of real-life “need.” In every
circumstance, however, the administrator must justify issuing more assistance than available
to the applicant “on paper” by articulating for the record the “emergency” situation that is
being alleviated. (For further discussion regarding the deficit and unmet need tests, refer to
the section on “Eligibility” found earlier in this chapter.)
Continuing on in our analysis, again using MMA’s GA application (Sections 8 and 9), the
following would depict Pat’s eligibility:
8. Deficit
A. Overall Maximum Level of
Assistance Allowed
(See GA Ordinance Appendix A) $ 578
D. Deficit
(If line A is greater than line B)
$ 95
B. Income
(See Section 4) $ 483
E. *Surplus
(If line B is greater than line A) $ ----
C. Result
(Line A minus line B)
$ 95 * NOTE: If a surplus exists, applicant is not eligible
for regular GA.
Proceed to Section 9 to determine if “unmet need”
results in eligibility for “emergency” GA.
9. Unmet Need
A. Allowed Expenses
(See Section 6)
$1,071.10
D. Unmet Need
(Amount from line C, but only if
line A is greater than line B)
$ 588.10
B. Income
(See Section 4)
$ 483.00
E. Deficit
(See Section 8, line D)
$ 95.00
C. Result
(Line A minus line B)
$ 588.10
F. Amount of GA Eligibility
(The lower of line D and line E)
$ 95.00
53
INSTRUCTIONS:
1) If Section 8, line B (income) is greater than line A (overall maximum), then applicant has a surplus of
$__________ and will not be eligible for General Assistance unless the GA administrator determines there is
need for emergency assistance.
2) If Section 9, line A (allowed expenses) is greater than line B (income), the result will be an “Unmet Need” (line
D).
3) If there is both an “Unmet Need” (Section 9, line D) and a “Deficit” (Section 9, line E), the applicant will be
eligible for the lower of the two amounts. This lower amount is the amount of assistance the applicant is eligible
for in the next 30-day period, or a proportionate amount for a shorter period of eligibility (e.g., if the applicant
needs one week’s worth of GA assistance, they should receive 1/4 of the 30-day amount).
In this case, Pat’s maximum level allowed (amount from GA ordinance?Appendix A) was
$578). Pat’s TANF income is $483. Therefore, the household “deficit” is $95 ($578 - $483).
The administrator now has to compare Pat’s deficit to her “unmet need” to determine
eligibility for regular GA (non-emergency GA eligibility).
Determination of GA Grant
After working through both the deficit test and the unmet need test on Pat Johnston’s
application for GA, the administrator determined that Pat’s deficit of $95 is dwarfed by her
unmet need of $588.10. A disparity such as this between the deficit and the unmet need
results is common. Once both the deficit and unmet needs tests have been calculated, the
rule of thumb is that the applicant is only eligible for the lower of the two amounts. The
result in this case is that Pat is eligible for only $95 worth of assistance (the lower of $95
and $588.10) for a 30-day period, unless she is facing an emergency situation.
In this case, Pat was not facing an emergency. Although her food supplement benefit could
not be considered as either income or a resource, Pat acknowledged that she had enough
food supplement benefit to get by and was not seeking any food assistance. Pat had not paid
her August rent and was worried about being evicted, but her landlord had waited for rent in
the past and had not started an eviction action at this point. Pat was also behind on her
electric bill, but the electric company was not threatening to disconnect her service.
Because Pat was not facing any clear emergency situation, the administrator felt that all he
could issue at this point was her $95 deficit, which Pat asked to be applied toward her
electric bill. The administrator was not insensitive to the fact that Pat was getting behind
financially and would clearly be facing some tough times during the upcoming fall and
winter. For this reason, the administrator made it clear to Pat both orally and in writing that
the town would be able to provide Pat more than the $95 per month in “emergency” GA
during the winter as long as Pat would work with the town by spending her income solely on
basic necessities and by actively pursuing all other resources that could reduce her need for
GA.
54
The administrator spent an extra half hour with Pat and they worked out a “get-through-thewinter”
plan whereby Pat would (1) seek more affordable housing; (2) take 90% of her
TANF check in the beginning of every month and apply that income toward her rent;
(3) keep receipts of all her expenditures in an organized way for the administrator’s review;
(4) apply for GA when necessary on the first and third Monday of every month; (5) work out
a budget or special payment arrangement plan with the utility company; and (6) apply for
HEAP/ECIP benefits as soon as the local CAP agency begins to accept applications.
In return, the administrator suggested to Pat that the town would be able to regularly apply
GA for the purpose of Pat’s energy needs, because the lack of electricity or an adequate
supply of heating fuel in the winter would generally be considered an emergency situation.
Presumption of Eligibility
All of the variables affecting or determining eligibility which have been discussed above
may be waived by the administrator under certain circumstances, that is when the applicant
is in an emergency shelter for the homeless and the municipality has made prior
arrangements with that shelter to presume shelter clients eligible for municipal assistance.
22 M.R.S.A. § 4304 (3).
This presumption of GA eligibility is made entirely at municipal discretion; in fact, to
presume someone eligible for GA runs somewhat counter to the eligibility determination
process as outlined elsewhere in GA law, which generally calls for a written application and
decision process. The primary purpose of this type of presumption would be so that those
cities dealing with large transient populations could defer, for a short period of time, the
paperwork necessary to establish GA eligibility.
Emergencies
The preceding discussion has focused on the first step of the eligibility determination
process, which is the calculation of the difference between an applicant’s 30-day need for
basic necessities and the applicant’s 30-day income. This calculation of an applicant’s
“unmet need” and “deficit” is the first of two steps in the overall determination of an
applicant’s eligibility for GA. The second step involves the determination of whether the
applicant is in an “emergency” situation. It should always be remembered that General
Assistance is both a non-emergency and emergency assistance program rolled into one, and
as a matter of law, emergency GA is specifically available to people who would not
normally be eligible. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4308(2).
55
This aspect of the law has caused considerable confusion in the past. If a person is eligible
for emergency assistance when they are not otherwise eligible for GA, many administrators
have wondered what purpose there is in determining eligibility at all.
Although GA is not a program intended to provide emergency assistance only, almost all
applicants think their requests for GA are emergencies and very often the bulk of the
administrator’s time is spent averting or resolving emergencies. But because GA is not just
an emergency program, and because emergency situations must be handled differently, an
explanation of what constitutes a GA emergency is warranted.
State law defines an “emergency” as either: (1) a life threatening situation; or (2) a situation
beyond the individual’s control which, if not alleviated immediately, could reasonably be
expected to pose a threat to an individual’s health or safety. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(4).
Although the definition is clear, determining whether an emergency exists is not always so
obvious. There are very few black and white situations in GA. Is going without electricity
always an emergency? Is being without food an emergency? Is running out of oil or wood an
emergency? Is not having shoes? Having no transportation? The clear, straightforward
answer is...it depends!
Imminent Emergencies
Section 4308(2) includes a provision relating to “imminent emergencies.” An imminent
emergency is one where failure to provide assistance may result in unnecessary cost and/or
undue hardship. An example of undue hardship relative to unnecessary cost would be a
client incurring court costs for an eviction notice when such costs could have been averted if
the municipality assisted with the past due rent at the time the landlord threatened eviction
(as opposed to waiting for a formal notice of eviction). In such an instance, the unnecessary
cost would be the court fees added to the cost of curing the eviction. (Of course this example
presupposes that the applicant is eligible for GA). Because the GA applicant would be
eligible for the assistance, the GA administrator is able (if they so choose) to assist the
applicant prior to the receipt of an official eviction notice?avoiding having the applicant
incur court costs.
Emergency Analysis
The place to begin any emergency analysis is after the determination of the applicant’s
“unmet need” and “deficit.” Generally, applicants are only eligible for GA up to their unmet
56
need or deficit, whichever is less. If more assistance than the deficit/unmet need is required,
the applicants have a burden of demonstrating that they are facing an emergency situation.
To look at it another way, applicants are eligible for an amount of GA up to their
deficit/unmet need (whichever is less) whether or not they are in an emergency
circumstance. Therefore, if the applicant’s needs can be addressed within the maximum
levels of assistance in the ordinance, the administrator need not concern him or herself with
an analysis of whether the applicant’s current circumstance is or is not an “emergency
situation.”
A careful review of the applicant’s actual circumstances for the purpose of determining
whether he or she is facing an emergency is only necessary when the applicant is either:
1) not eligible for GA because there is no unmet need/deficit; or 2) eligible for some GA,
but not enough to cover all the applicant’s requested needs.
In short, it is only when an applicant is requesting GA for which he or she is not
automatically eligible that an emergency analysis need occur.
In conducting an emergency analysis the administrator should consider the following facts:
? whether it is an initial application;
? the household composition (e.g., infants, children, elderly, ill, disabled people);
? whether the situation was foreseeable;
? whether the situation was avoidable;
? any unusual or major changes in the household (e.g., medical problems, a lay-off, etc.);
? the consequences to the household if GA were not granted;
? the availability of other resources to reduce or eliminate the problem;
? whether the applicants had or currently have the opportunity or ability to rectify the
situation;
? whether GA is needed immediately;
? whether the applicants have an eviction or utility disconnection notice or notice of tax
lien or mortgage foreclosure;
57
? whether the situation, if beyond the applicants’ control, poses a threat to their health or
safety;
? whether the situation is life threatening (i.e., the applicants could conceivably die if
relief were withheld);
? whether there is an imminent emergency that may result in undue hardship and
unnecessary costs.
Considering these questions in conjunction with the type of assistance requested should help
the administrator clarify whether an emergency exists. For instance, if a family is over
income and requests food saying they are totally out, the administrator should consider such
questions as: when will they receive their next check; are there relatives who are willing and
able to help; is the family totally out of food or merely out of certain type of food, etc. If the
household’s next paycheck is due in two days, two days’ worth of GA may be in order. If a
local food bank, relatives or friends are available, GA may not have to be granted provided
the applicants are willing to use these alternative sources of assistance. However, if a family
member such as an infant or elderly person has special dietary needs not met by the local
food bank, the administrator would have to consider that fact.
Alleviating Emergencies & Imminent Emergencies
When the administrator determines that the household is, indeed, facing an emergency such
that more GA than the household is otherwise eligible for will have to be provided, the next
determination is whether the municipality must grant the amount or type of assistance the
applicant is requesting. In many instances, the emergency situation facing the household can
be alleviated more cost effectively than by simply granting the applicant’s request.
For example, if Anton Arcane, with no unmet need, applies to the selectpersons in
Meddybemps because the bank is threatening to foreclose on his home, and the bank will
not stop the foreclosure for less than $2,000, the Meddybemps’ selectpersons could issue a
decision which indicates that Anton is or will be eligible for emergency GA to secure
housing for himself and his family, but not at a cost of $2,000.
The decision would direct Anton to seek alternative housing (i.e., rental property) which
could be secured at a cost more in line with the housing maximum in the municipal
ordinance. The decision would further direct Anton to contact the selectpersons for
disbursement of his GA when such housing was found.
58
Documenting Emergencies
By regulation, DHHS requires some degree of documentation in the applicant’s case file
whenever emergency GA is granted. The documentation can take the form of a simple
written statement describing the emergency situation in the administrator’s own words. Such
a written statement would be part of either the notice of eligibility issued to the recipient or
on a separate narrative statement that would become part of the recipient’s case file. The
documentation can also take the form of a photocopy of the eviction or disconnection notice
or any other written material submitted by the applicant to document his or her emergency
need.
Limitations on Emergency GA
Under GA law, there are two situations when an applicant is not eligible for emergency GA.
These are: (1) when the applicant is currently disqualified for violating the GA law; and (2)
when assistance is requested to alleviate an emergency situation which the applicant could
have averted with his or her own income and resources. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4308.
Disqualified Applicants
If people have been disqualified from receiving GA because they are fugitives from justice
(§ 4301(3)), committed fraud (§ 4315), didn’t comply with the municipality’s work
requirement (§ 4316-A), or didn’t attempt to use potential resources to which they were
directed (§ 4317), they are not eligible for any non-emergency GA or emergency GA during
the time they are disqualified. Therefore, if a woman is disqualified because she committed
fraud but she applies to the town because she has an eviction notice, the administrator has no
legal obligation to provide assistance during her 120-day disqualification.
It is important to remember, however, that the disqualification of a household member for a
violation of a program rule does not affect the eligibility of any member of the household
who is not capable of working (dependent minor children; caregivers for children under six
years of age; elderly; ill or disabled persons or their caregivers). For further discussion
regarding the continuing eligibility of these dependents when a household member has been
disqualified, see “Dependents” in Chapter 4.
Misuse of Income
The other situation that would result in an applicant not being eligible for emergency
assistance is when the applicant could have averted the emergency with available income
and resources. Unlike the ineligibility for emergency assistance which occurs as a result of
disqualification, this limitation on emergency assistance would affect the entire household’s
59
eligibility. Under the law, no emergency, no matter how short or long term the emergency
has been in the making, need be alleviated by the municipality with emergency GA if the
applicant could have averted the emergency with his or her own income or resources. The
law reads as follows:
Municipalities may by standards adopted in municipal ordinances restrict the
disbursement of emergency assistance to alleviate situations to the extent that those
situations could not have been averted by the applicant’s use of income and
resources for basic necessities. The person requesting assistance shall provide
evidence of income and resources for the applicable time period.
The wording of § 4308(2)(B) creates questions and issues. For example, what happens when
the applicant is really facing a life-threatening situation, such as homelessness or running
out of fuel in sub-freezing weather? Would the limitation on emergency assistance still
apply? What happens when the limit on emergency assistance yields eligibility that is not
enough to alleviate the emergency? Does the administrator issue the assistance anyway?
What happens when a disconnection emergency evolves into a housing emergency, or an
applicant’s emergency circumstance continues for an extended period of time? If an
applicant could clearly have averted a utility disconnection, but didn’t and is therefore
ineligible for emergency GA, will he or she remain ineligible for emergency utility
assistance from that point onward?
The answers to all these questions are not entirely clear, but it would seem that the history of
this section of law may provide some guidance. The original purpose of § 4308(2)(B) was to
limit the amount of assistance available to cure an unnecessary debt. Clearly, this section
expands on that original purpose, but there is still evidence to suggest that when the request
for emergency assistance, for whatever reason, moves from curing an unnecessary debt to
providing for a prospective need, the mechanics of evaluating the emergency GA limitation,
at least according to the MMA model ordinance, changes (see Examples 3 and 4, below).
A central factor governing the limitation on emergency assistance is the “applicable time
period.” The term “applicable time period” is found in the law at § 4308(2)(B), but is not
carefully defined. It is reasonable to consider the “applicable time period” as the period of
time which should be reviewed to determine an applicant’s financial ability to avert an
emergency situation. According to the MMA model ordinance, the applicable time period is
generally the last 30 days, unless the emergency is the result of a “negative account
balance,” in which case the applicable period of time is the duration of that negative account
balance. The following examples are offered as reasonable interpretations of the mechanics
of emergency assistance limitation:
60
Example 1: Alfred Adler has received a seven-day eviction notice. He owes $900. He has
no deficit. The $900 demanded by the eviction notice covers the last two months rent, and so
the “applicable time period” of review for the purposes of determining any limit on
emergency assistance is the last 60 days. A review of Alfred’s income during that period
reveals that he had enough money to pay his rent, as well as all his other basic needs. Alfred
is therefore denied any assistance.
Example 2: Melanie Klein applies for help with her utility bill. Melanie’s deficit is $90 and
her unmet need is $390. The power company is threatening to turn off her electricity unless
she pays a “repair amount” of $450. The administrator learns that Melanie has not paid
anything on her electric bill since a HEAP benefit was applied toward her account six
months ago. Melanie is on TANF and receives, as a household of three, $493 per month.
With a rental payment of $400 a month, and enormous fuel oil costs over the winter to heat
her poorly insulated apartment, it is clear that Melanie may not have had a financial capacity
to stay current with her electric bill. After Melanie provided proof that she had been
spending her limited income on basic needs throughout the winter, the administrator
processed her request for emergency assistance without imposing any limitation. If there is
an imminent emergency such as a disconnection that will occur before the next paycheck is
received, the municipality may choose to assist to avoid the extra cost of the reconnect fee.
Example 3: With a notice of mortgage foreclosure in hand, Otto Rank applies to the town
for help. Otto was laid off from his job two months ago and is desperately trying to save his
home. Early negotiations with the bank prove to be futile; the foreclosure will occur unless
Otto makes a payment of $2,400. The facts of the case are as follows: The $2,400 debt
represents Otto’s mortgage payments for the last four months; the applicable time period,
therefore, is four months, which is the period of time Otto had a negative account balance
with the mortgagee. Otto’s mortgage obligation of $600 per month is $50 over the
applicable ordinance maximum for housing. Otto is currently receiving unemployment
benefits and has no deficit and a $20 unmet need. Prior to becoming unemployed, Otto had
an income surplus of nearly $400.
Given this information, and using the standards in the MMA model ordinance, the
administrator determines that Otto is eligible for emergency assistance in response to the
foreclosure not to exceed $140. The administrator came to this figure by: 1) finding that
Otto had sufficient funds to meet his mortgage obligation for the first two months of the
applicable time period; 2) finding that Otto was financially unable to avert the emergency
during the last two months of the applicable time period by the amount of: a) the $20 per
month unmet need; and b) the $50 per month difference between Otto’s actual monthly
mortgage payment and the ordinance maximum.
61
The administrator chose to use her discretion to disregard the difference between Otto’s
actual shelter cost and the ordinance maximum because it did not seem reasonable to hold
Otto to the ordinance maximum given his recent and sudden unemployment. Upon reaching
this decision, the administrator informed the bank that all Otto was eligible for to address the
foreclosure was $140. The bank indicated that it would not accept the $140 payment. The
administrator informed Otto of the bank’s decision and asked how he wanted his assistance
distributed. Otto got mad and left the office in anger.
Example 4: A week later Otto is back with a request for assistance for a new apartment.
Otto still has a $20 unmet need, but costs associated with getting into the new housing forces
him to request $200 in emergency assistance. As a matter of law, it would appear, the need
for emergency assistance still revolves around the foreclosure, and Otto could not satisfy his
burden of showing that he could not have averted the emergency. The same limitation on
emergency assistance to $140 could still be applied, therefore, as a matter of law. But under
the MMA model ordinance, since the emergency assistance request no longer involves
curing a past debt, the “applicable time period” to be used to determine any limit on
emergency assistance could be reduced to 30 days. An analysis of Otto’s previous 30-day
income shows that he legitimately did not have sufficient resources to avert the emergency,
and so Otto would be eligible for that assistance.
With regard to the calculation of eligibility for emergency assistance, a couple of points
should be noted. First, when attempting to determine whether the applicant could have
financially averted the emergency, the administrator should rely on the applicant’s unmet
need during the applicable time period, rather than the applicant’s deficit. The deficit is a
somewhat arbitrary number that may or may not reflect what any particular household
reasonably needs to get by over a 30-day period. The unmet need, on the other hand, is a
much more accurate representation of the financial needs of the household. All emergency
GA decisions made by an administrator—whether the emergency GA is granted, partially
granted, denied or limited—are quickly subject to second guessing and challenge. The most
an administrator can do is issue a decision that has a clear rationale; that is, the
reasonableness of the decision can be clearly explained in relation to the factual
circumstances and the pertinent provisions of law or local ordinance.

63
CHAPTER 3 – Eligibility / Other Conditions
Once the administrator has determined that the applicants are in need (i.e., their income is
less than the maximum levels of assistance), the administrator’s next step is to consider
other eligibility conditions. Generally, these eligibility conditions apply only to people who
are not first-time applicants, i.e., people who have applied for GA at some time in the past,
although below we discuss several exceptions to this rule.
Fugitive From Justice
A person who is a fugitive from justice as defined in 15 M.R.S.A. § 201(4) is ineligible for
general assistance. A fugitive from justice is essentially anyone accused or convicted of a
crime in another state and whose presence is demanded by that state. (See 15 M.R.S.A.
§ 201(4) for a complete and detailed definition of “fugitive from justice”.)
Work Requirement
Everyone who is able to work is expected to fulfill the work requirement (§ 4316-A). People
who violate the work requirement are ineligible to receive GA for 120 days, except under
certain circumstances (see “Just Cause,” below, and “Eligibility Regained,” in Chapter 3).
People are considered able to work unless they are mentally or physically ill or disabled, or
if they are the only person in a household available to care for an ill or disabled member of
the household or a child who is not yet in school.
If applicants claim they have an illness or a disability which prevents them from working,
they must give the administrator a written statement from a physician certifying that they
can’t work unless their inability to work is plainly apparent, in which case the
documentation would not be necessary.
GA administrators should require that medical letters from physicians include, the extent of
disability (e.g., 100%), the duration the person is anticipated to be “disabled,” specific work
restrictions if the individual is not completely disabled, and possibly the date of next reevaluation.
The work requirement means that in order to be eligible for assistance people must:
? look for work;
? accept work;
64
? register for work with the Maine Job Service;
? participate in a municipal work-for-welfare (workfare) program;
? not quit work and not be discharged for misconduct; and
? participate in an educational or work training program.
Just Cause
If people refuse or fail to fulfill the work requirement without just cause, they will be
ineligible to receive GA for 120 days. Determining whether applicants had just cause for not
fulfilling the work requirement can be very difficult, but essentially it depends on whether
they can show that they had a good reason. Just cause is defined as a “valid verifiable reason
that hinders the individual from complying with one or more conditions of eligibility”
(§ 4301(8)). Specific excuses, which would be considered just cause, include:
? a physical or mental illness or disability that prevents a person from performing work
duties;
? receiving wages that are below minimum wage standards;
? being sexually harassed at the workplace;
? inability to arrange for necessary care for children, or ill or disabled family members;
? any other reason that the administrator thinks is reasonable and appropriate.
If applicants have not complied with the work requirement and they cannot show that they
had just cause, the administrator should immediately and formally (i.e., in writing)
disqualify them for 120 days. Before the administrator disqualifies the applicants, however,
he or she should attempt to determine if they acted with just cause.
For example, if a man quit his job because he didn’t get along well with his boss, that is not
just cause. But if he quit his job because he had to work nights and no one was available to
care for his young son and daughter, that would be just cause. Therefore it is critical to
inquire into the reasons behind someone’s failure to comply with the work requirement. Just
because the administrator should undertake this type of inquiry does not mean that the
municipality has a burden of proving that there was no just cause reason for the work-related
failure. In fact, GA law places the burden of proof squarely on the applicant. 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4316-A (1).
65
Illness
One common excuse for failing to fulfill the work requirement is illness. If a person claims a
long-term physical or mental illness or disability, he or she must present a doctor’s statement
verifying that he or she is unable to work or detailing the work restrictions the applicant has.
However, the administrator cannot require a recipient to produce medical verification if a
condition is apparent or of such short duration that a reasonable person would not ordinarily
seek medical attention. If the municipality requires medical verification and the person has
no means to pay for the exam, the municipality must pay but may choose the doctor.
22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A(5).
The question of medical verification can cause a problem when people on workfare don’t
show up for their assignment and attribute it to being sick. If it’s just for a day, it is not
necessarily reasonable that they see a doctor. Some municipalities require people to call in
sick; however, if they don’t have a phone and they are sick this requirement is impractical.
Again, the key is reasonableness. For instance, the ordinance could require that people who
claim they are sick and fail to fulfill the workfare assignment on two out of three days must
have medical verification; and if they cannot produce it the administrator will disqualify
them for willfully failing to perform workfare without just cause. A municipality could
allow a person to miss one day without calling in if the recipient has no phone. However, if
the recipient didn’t show up for work and did not call or otherwise give notice to the
administrator the following day, the administrator could disqualify the recipient if he or she
couldn’t show just cause.
If your municipality wants to develop specific standards to further clarify the general
concept of “just cause,” those standards should be contained in your ordinance or written out
on the recipient’s decision of eligibility in order for them to be enforceable.
Example: Joe Morgan was laid off from work. His unemployment compensation has
expired so he needs GA. He has received GA for about one month and has been looking for
work, plus doing workfare. Today when he applied, he told the GA administrator that he
didn’t look for work last week because he was too frustrated looking for work and always
getting rejected. Although he had completed his workfare assignments, Joe said he wouldn’t
do any more workfare because it wasn’t getting him anywhere. The administrator
disqualified him for 120 days, but told him he could be eligible again if he fulfilled the work
requirement.
One week later Joe came in to reapply for assistance. He gave the administrator proof that he
had applied for work at the required number of places and he agreed to do workfare.
66
Because he had fulfilled the work requirement, the administrator revoked his ineligibility
status and gave him GA for a week.
Example: It was the first time Sherry Norris applied for GA. She was unemployed, her
husband had just left her, and she had no money. Because she was in need and it was her
initial application, Sherry was granted assistance. She was told that she would have to look
for work and also do workfare. Sherry agreed to do 15 hours work for the assistance she
received. She worked five hours but never came back to finish the assignment. When she
applied for assistance the next week the administrator disqualified her until she completed
her assignment. She agreed. When she did her remaining ten hours of work she reapplied for
GA, agreed to do workfare in the future and was granted assistance. She had regained her
eligibility because she complied with the workfare assignment.
Example: Jonathan and Jill London applied for GA for their family. Jonathan received
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for an undisclosed disability, but he was able to care
for their two small children. Jill was informed that she would have to apply for work too at
least three separate employers a week in order to be eligible for future assistance. Jonathan
said that no wife of his was going to work, and informed the administrator that Jill would
not be looking for any jobs. The administrator disqualified Jonathan and Jill from receiving
GA for 120 days, but noted in her decision the eligibility of the London’s two children.
Section 4309(3) provides that no dependents (or persons whose presence is required in order
to care for dependents) will lose their eligibility due to the ineligibility of other members of
the household (see “Dependents,” in Chapter 4).
Job Quit & Discharge for Misconduct
GA law has long provided that when a municipality establishes that a non-initial applicant
has quit his or her job without just cause, that person shall be disqualified from receiving
GA for an extended period of time, now 120 days. The policy behind this provision of law is
very clear; that is, GA recipients are expected to utilize in all good faith the advantages of
employment in order to reduce their need for ongoing public assistance.
Despite the clear intention of the law, municipal administrators were sometimes frustrated
when employed recipients did not quit their jobs but behaved in such a way at their
workplace that they were discharged from their employment for misconduct. A Maine
Supreme Court decision, Gilman v. Lewiston, 524 A.2d 1205 (Me. 1987) ruled that the
ineligibility due to job quit could not be applied to applicants who were discharged for
misconduct. As a result, in 1991, the Legislature addressed the issue by amending GA law in
such a way that municipalities were authorized to disqualify for 90 days (the disqualification
67
period at that time) any non-initial applicant whom the administrator established was
discharged from his or her employment for misconduct, as misconduct is defined in Maine
law at 26 M.R.S.A. § 1043(23). (See below for a full discussion of this definition.)
A next milestone in the evolution of this ineligibility status (which has the effect of a
disqualification) procedure occurred in June of 1993. The Legislature amended GA law to
disqualify for 120 days any applicant, including any initial applicant, when that applicant
quit his or her job without just cause or was discharged from employment for misconduct. In
making this change, the Legislature also clarified that the 120-day disqualification for job
quit or employment discharge would commence on the date of separation from employment.
In this respect, the ineligibility period for unwarranted job quit or discharge for misconduct
is designed differently than the ineligibility for a work search or workfare-related failure. In
the case of a work search or workfare failure, only repeat applicants could possibly be
subject to disqualification, and the 120-day disqualification period does not begin until the
administrator becomes aware of the work search or workfare violation and formally notifies
the GA recipient of their ineligibility.
In the case of job quit or discharge for misconduct, the 120-day ineligibility period is to be
applied to all applicants, whether or not they are initial or repeat applicants, and the
disqualification period begins automatically on the date of job separation, which typically
occurred days, weeks, or even months in the past.
More About Misconduct
First, it is unclear what relationship exists, if any, between GA law and the significant body
of legal precedent established as a result of processing claims for unemployment benefits
pursuant to Maine Unemployment Compensation law. It is fair to say that in the context of
determining eligibility for unemployment benefits, disputes often surface between the
discharged employee and his or her employer as to whether the employee’s actions which
led to discharge were actually “misconduct” as a matter of law. These disputes are usually
resolved by means of a hearing held and determination issued by a Hearings Officer with the
Department of Labor.
The Hearings Officer’s determination, of course, is subject to appeals into the courts, and a
body of case law has developed which provides further guidance as to what is and what is
not “misconduct.” Because GA law specifically cites the definition of “misconduct” in
unemployment law, it is very probable that if a GA disqualification for misconduct was
68
appealed into the courts, the judge would apply unemployment case law to the facts before
the court to reach a decision.
Given this set of circumstances, GA administrators in the past often elected to put off
making a decision as to whether a particular discharge was due to “misconduct” until the
Department of Labor Hearing Officer had issued a determination. That is, the GA
administrator was well advised to rely on the special expertise of the Hearing Officer.
Currently, given the status of the law which now starts the ineligibility period at the date of
job separation, it no longer makes sense to wait until a determination of the Department of
Labor because by that time the ineligibility period would be partially or entirely used up. In
short, one consequence of the current unemployment law for the GA program is that more
pressure is on municipal administrators to determine in a timely manner and on their own
whether or not the discharge from employment was due to “misconduct” or not.
Furthermore, a determination by the Department of Labor is not available to a discharged
employee who is not eligible for unemployment benefits because the employee does not
have a sufficient base of previous earnings from which to draw current benefits. Therefore,
many GA recipients who may get discharged for misconduct will not have an opportunity
for their case to be heard by the Department of Labor. In this circumstance, also, the
municipal administrator will need to determine if the actions for which the employee was
discharged reach the level of misconduct.
Because it is to the employer’s financial advantage to discharge for misconduct rather than
simply lay employees off, it is sometimes the case that the employer’s claim of misconduct
is not credible. At the very least, GA administrators should inquire as to the specific reasons
the employee was discharged, what rules were violated, whether the employee had received
verbal or written warnings, the nature of the employee’s long-term record, whether other
employees had been discharged for similar behavior, and so on.
In cases of egregious employee misbehavior, such as when the employee deliberately and
willfully damages the employer’s property or causes harm to fellow employees, the GA
administrator can easily justify a 120-day ineligibility period.
In cases where the alleged violation is less certain, the administrator may wish to consult the
municipal attorney, MMA or other sources familiar with the legal concept of employee
misconduct. For more guidance, a summary of selected cases regarding the issue of
misconduct are found at Appendix 5.
69
Misconduct Defined
The definition of misconduct up until spring of 1999 contained a very difficult standard to
meet, one which required that the employer prove that the employee committed an offense
which “evinc[ed] such willful and wanton disregard of an employer’s interest as is found in
deliberate violations…of the employer’s interest…” The definition of misconduct, after the
Legislature’s 1999 amendment, currently reads in part:
“Misconduct” means a culpable breach of the employee’s duties or obligations to the
employer or a pattern of irresponsible behavior, which in either case manifests a disregard
for a material interest of the employer.
? The new definition of misconduct also contains a non-all-inclusive list of 14 acts or
omissions which are “presumed to manifest a disregard for a material interest of the
employer.” Acts and omissions on the list include: Refusal, knowing failure or
recurring neglect to perform reasonable and proper duties assigned by the employer;
? Unreasonable violation of rules that are reasonably imposed and communicated and
equitably enforced;
? Failure to exercise due care for punctuality or attendance after warnings;
? Intoxication, illegal drug use or being under the influence while on duty or when
reporting to work;
? Unauthorized sleeping while on duty;
? Insubordination or refusal without good cause to follow reasonable and proper
instructions from the employer.
The new definition of misconduct (subpart B) however, contains several mitigating factors,
which if established, could serve to overcome misconduct otherwise established. This part of
the statute provides that misconduct cannot be found solely on:
1. An isolated error in judgment or failure to perform satisfactorily when the employee has
made a good faith effort to perform the duties assigned;
2. Absenteeism caused by illness or the employee or an immediate family member if the
employee made a reasonable effort to give notice of the absence and to comply with the
employer’s notification rules and policies; or
70
3. Actions taken by the employee, that were necessary, to protect the employee or an
immediate family member from domestic violence if the employee made all reasonable
efforts to preserve the employment.
As a result, municipalities analyzing misconduct for purposes of the work requirement under
the GA program must be certain to review subpart B—the mitigating factors just
mentioned—whenever performing a “misconduct” analysis. (See Chapter 13, page 211 for a
copy of the entire definition of misconduct—26 M.R.S.A. § 1043 (23).)
Municipal Work-for-Welfare Program (Workfare)
In addition to requiring recipients to seek work in the private sector, the municipality also
has the option of establishing a workfare program. The workfare program allows
municipalities to require GA recipients to perform work for the municipality or a non-profit
organization in return for any assistance they receive (§ 4316-A (2)). For a sample
agreement governing workfare referrals between a municipality and a non-profit
organization, see Appendix 7 and 12. Before a municipality can institute a workfare
program, the municipal officers must adopt it as part of the GA ordinance. The MMA model
GA ordinance contains language authorizing the operation of a workfare program. After its
adoption the municipality can require physically and mentally able people to do work for the
municipality. State law specifically exempts from workfare people who are incapable of
performing the workfare assignment for reasons of mental or physical incapacity. Also
exempted are people who must stay home to care for a child who is not yet in school, or for
any ill or disabled member of the household.
Just Cause
Once a municipality adopts workfare, if a recipient refuses to participate in the workfare
program or if he or she agrees and then willfully fails to complete the assignment or
performs the work assignment below average standards without just cause, that individual is
to be disqualified for 120 days. The just cause provisions are the same as those for the
“work requirements,” (see the first page of this Chapter).
However, no dependents in the household can be disqualified merely because another
household member has not complied with the workfare requirement.
Limitations
There are some limitations on how workfare is administered:
71
? In no case may a person be required to perform workfare prior to receiving assistance
when that person is in need of and eligible for emergency GA.
? No workfare assignment can interfere with a recipient’s existing employment. The
MMA model GA ordinance captures this non-interference rule by limiting the total
workfare assignment to 40 hours per week. Any hours of actual employment for which
the recipient is scheduled to work would be subtracted from the workfare 40-hours per
week maximum. Therefore if a person is working full-time, the administrator cannot
require participation in the workfare program. If a person works part-time, for instance
15 hours a week, the maximum number of hours he or she could perform workfare
would be 25 hours. If a person is also expected to search for work, the administrator
should make sure there is adequate time to look for work.
? The number of hours a person must work is determined by the amount of assistance
granted. The number of hours is determined by dividing the amount of assistance
granted by at least the minimum wage rate. For instance, if a person received $100 for
food and rent, he or she would have to work about 13 hours ($100 divided by $7.50—
State Minimum Wage). No person may be required to work more hours than the value
of the assistance received. Furthermore, in no event may a person be required to work
more than 40 hours.
? Workfare, as well as the work requirement, cannot interfere with a recipient’s existing
employment, ability to attend a job interview, or participation in an education program
intended to lead to a high school diploma. Further, it cannot interfere with participation
in a training program approved or determined by the Department of Labor to be
reasonably expected to help the individual get a job. Workfare must be arranged around
people’s schedules if they are in an approved training or educational program.
However, no special allowances need to be made for college students who are not in a
study program operated under the control of the Department of Health and Human
Services or Department of Labor.
? Workfare cannot be used as a way to replace regular municipal employees. In other
words, a town cannot fire employees or reduce their hours simply because it wanted
workfare recipients to perform the same work.
? No recipient may be required to perform workfare for a non-profit organization if that
would violate a basic religious belief of the recipient.
72
Background
Because workfare is one aspect of the work requirement that municipalities have the option
of adopting and have virtually complete control over, it is important to examine it at greater
length. Although working for welfare is a concept that has been around since the days of
“poor farms,” and later the WPA during the Depression, workfare as it is currently known
was enacted by the Legislature at MMA’s request in 1977. If administered responsibly and
creatively, workfare can enhance the self-esteem of the GA recipients who are pleased that
they are working for their assistance, while also helping the municipality get jobs done that
might never have been accomplished. A workfare program can save the municipality money
by discovering those people who don’t really need GA and refuse to work. Most
importantly, a workfare program can give GA recipients job skills, confidence and job
references which could lead to permanent employment.
A workfare program will be successful if the municipality attempts to administer the
program with the idea that workfare is a worthwhile program, not a punishment or just a
way to decrease GA costs and end welfare fraud. The job assignment should be for work
that the municipality truly needs done; that way recipients will know that their time is being
spent meaningfully. “Make work” assignments should be avoided or minimized to the extent
possible since these assignments usually result in poor performances by the recipients. Not
all workfare assignments are going to be attractive or exciting to the recipients, but the
administrator should stress that if the recipient performs well, the administrator or the site
supervisor could be used as a job reference.
If a municipality establishes a workfare program, it is critical that the municipal employees
cooperate. The municipal employees should be aware that they should treat the workfare
recipients decently. The employees are also a good source for suggesting possible job
assignments that they know need to be done but they can’t get to at all or as soon as
necessary.
Another way for municipalities to help their GA recipients is to encourage those without a
high school diploma to return to school or take classes to receive their GED (Graduate Exam
Diploma). Since a high school diploma is the key to many job opportunities, it makes sense
for municipalities to waive the workfare requirement for recipients who agree to go to
school, with the understanding that if they do not attend classes they will be assigned to do
workfare. For more detailed discussion about implementing a workfare program, see
Appendix 6.
73
Workfare First
Municipalities are authorized to withhold the issuance of non-emergency GA until the
successful completion of a workfare assignment. It should be noted at the outset that
“workfare-first” is not a requirement of law; the administrator may continue to administer
the town’s workfare program just as it has been administered in the past. Requiring
applicants to work before their welfare is issued is a procedure that the administrator may
use at his or her discretion. In other words, a “workfare-first” system has been established
as an option available to municipal GA administrators.
The MMA model GA ordinance includes some guidelines governing this procedure and
otherwise provide the necessary protections to the workfare participants. Those guidelines
cover the following “workfare first” issues.
Workfare First Guidelines—Emergency GA
Under no circumstance may the administrator withhold the issuance of emergency GA while
a recipient is performing workfare. This means that if an applicant is eligible for and in need
of immediate assistance to alleviate a life-threatening situation or a situation posing a threat
to health or safety, that amount of assistance will be immediately issued. A workfare
assignment can still be created to cover the value of that emergency assistance. It is only the
case that the recipient of that assistance cannot be compelled to perform workfare prior to
the assistance being issued.
Workfare First Guidelines—A Description of the Grant of Assistance
Just because the law now authorizes a “workfare first” procedure does not mean that the
eligibility determination process can be delayed until a person “proves” him or herself by
working for the municipality. There has been absolutely no change in GA law with regard to
an applicant’s right to receive a written decision of eligibility within 24 hours of applying
for assistance. Furthermore, if that grant of GA is to be granted on the condition that an
assignment of workfare is first performed, that written decision must include enough
specific information so that the recipient clearly understands his or her rights and
responsibilities. To begin with, the recipient must be informed up front about the actual
grant of assistance that will be issued upon the successful completion of the workfare
assignment.
For example, a “workfare first” decision might read: “You have been found eligible to
receive, upon the successful completion of the workfare assignment described below, $175
for October’s rent in the form of a rental voucher to your landlord, $40 toward October’s
74
light bill issued to the utility company, and $50 for heating fuel issued to the local fuel oil
dealer.”
Workfare First Guidelines—Minimum Hourly Rate
No workfare participant can be required to work for the municipality more than the value of
the grant of general assistance divided by the prevailing minimum wage. In calculating the
duration of a workfare assignment, municipalities may use a workfare “wage rate” that is
higher than the prevailing minimum wage. Whatever workfare rate the municipality elects to
use in this calculation, the total value of the grant, the rate upon which the duration of the
assignment is calculated, and the total number of hours of the workfare assignment that must
be successfully completed before the issuance of the GA benefits must be clearly spelled out
in any “workfare-first” decision. The participant has a right to understand the specific terms
of such an agreement before assenting to those terms or, withdrawing his or her application
for assistance.
It is important to keep in mind that there is always the possibility that under a “workfare
first” arrangement the workfare participant will perform some of the workfare assignment,
but not all of it. Hopefully, it is obvious that under that circumstance the workfare
participant will be unconditionally eligible for an amount of GA that equals the number of
hours successfully worked times the hourly rate by which the duration of the workfare
assignment was calculated. It is for this reason that it is especially important that the
applicable hourly rate is a matter of record.
Workfare First Guidelines—Description of Workfare Assignment
Another component of a complete workfare decision is a general description of the workfare
assignment. It would be unreasonable to expect a person to enter into a workfare contract
with the municipality without having any sense of what type of work the town expects the
participant to perform. Whether the assignment will be (e.g., town’s transfer station to sort
recyclables, the town office for clerical-type duties, the Road Commissioner for road work,
the library for painting, the school for janitorial work), a brief description of the job to be
done should be provided the applicant in writing, along with: (1) the day or days of the
assignments; (2) the work site; (3) the time of day the participant is expected to show up at
the work site; (4) the supervisor or contact person; (5) the telephone number to call in the
case of absence; and (6) in the case of “workfare first,” the amount of workfare that must be
successfully performed before the GA grant will be actually issued.
75
Workfare First Guidelines—Agreement to Perform Assignment
It is very important that all workfare participants agree in writing to perform the workfare
assignment given them. The successful performance of a workfare assignment is a condition
of eligibility, and some applicants may decide that they do not really need the GA they are
requesting given the workfare assignment they would have to perform in return. Those
applicants should be given an opportunity to withdraw their application for assistance.
The way to determine any applicant’s willingness to accept the workfare assignment is by
asking that applicant to sign a workfare agreement form. MMA has such a form in its
package of GA materials, and a copy of the MMA workfare agreement form is found at
Appendix 7. If a person is unwilling to sign a workfare agreement form, the administrator
should ask the applicant if he or she intends to withdraw the application for assistance. If so,
a record of that withdrawal should be placed in the case file. If not, that applicant would be
disqualified from receiving GA for 120 days for a refusal to perform a workfare assignment
without just cause.
The need for “good” paperwork is demonstrated in the case where a person is given a
“workfare first” assignment and never shows up at the job site. In one such case, the
individual accepted the fact that the GA grant would be terminated, but objected to being
also disqualified for 120 days, given the fact that the town had issued no assistance to him. It
seems that the most straightforward way to deal with this circumstance is to make sure that
before they are asked to sign a workfare agreement form, all workfare participants are
clearly informed of the consequences of failing to perform the workfare assignment. If the
workfare participant is provided this information, signs the workfare agreement form, and
then fails to perform the workfare assignment, he or she would be unable to then claim that
the non-performance should be construed as a de facto withdrawal of application.
Workfare First Guidelines—Consequences of Failing to Perform Assignment
As just discussed, the other important information that should be conveyed to all workfare
participants, including “workfare first” participants, concerns the consequences of failing to
perform the workfare assignment.
When a person is given a “workfare first” assignment, there are three possibilities.
Hopefully, the participant will successfully perform the assignment and then be issued the
assistance as granted. The entirely contrary possibility is that the participant will not show
up for the assignment. The third possibility is that the participant will perform some of the
workfare assignment, but not all of it.
76
Under any type of workfare assignment, when the participant fails to perform some or all of
the assignment without just cause, that individual shall be found ineligible to receive GA for
a period of 120 days. There is a procedure, discussed below, for that individual to regain his
or her eligibility within the 120-day period, but the first procedural step after it has been
determined that the participant has failed to perform the workfare without just cause is the
imposition of the 120-day ineligibility period.
In addition, when the workfare assignment is a “workfare first” assignment, the GA that was
conditionally granted should be terminated after a participant has failed to perform the
workfare assignment. A termination of a grant of GA must be communicated to the recipient
in writing, along with the recipient’s appeal rights, just like a notification of ineligibility.
When a participant simply fails to show up for the workfare assignment or has otherwise
totally failed to perform the assignment, the notice of termination to the participant would
read something to the effect:
…the entire GA grant, conditionally granted on such-and-such a date, is being
terminated for a complete failure to perform the workfare assignment, without just
cause, as that assignment was described in the GA decision.
It gets a little more complicated when the participant performs some of the assignment
satisfactorily, but fails to perform the entire assignment. In that case, the participant is
unconditionally entitled to an amount of GA equal to the number of hours successfully
worked times the workfare “wage rate” used to calculate the duration of the workfare
assignment. The remaining amount of the original GA grant would be terminated, and a
notice must be issued to the participant that clearly spells out the value of the GA being
issued and the value of the GA being terminated, the reasons for the partial termination, and
the workfare participant’s appeal rights.
Workfare First—A Summary
Legislation enacted in 1993 authorizes—but does not require—municipalities to grant nonemergency
GA benefits conditionally on the successful completion of a specific workfare
assignment. In order to implement a “workfare first” procedure, GA administrators should
clearly inform all “workfare first” participants about the grant of assistance being
conditionally issued, the workfare assignment and when and where it is to be performed, the
way in which the duration of the workfare assignment was calculated, and the consequences
to the participant of entirely or partially failing to perform the assignment without just cause.
77
After being provided this information, the workfare participant should sign a form that
establishes the participant’s agreement to perform the assignment under the specified terms
and conditions. This type of paperwork should be in place for any type of workfare program,
either traditional workfare or “workfare first” assignments. The only practical difference is
that under “workfare first,” there is a more likely possibility that a participant will
successfully perform some part of a workfare assignment and yet not receive the GA
benefits to which he or she would then be unconditionally entitled. This potential for claims
against a municipality can be greatly reduced with a written record of quality.
Workers’ Compensation
One troublesome aspect about workfare is the possibility of a recipient being injured while
performing workfare. The question of whether workfare recipients are considered
“employees” for the purpose of receiving Workers’ Compensation was decided by the
Maine Supreme Court in Closson v. Town of Southwest Harbor, 512 A.2d 1028 (Me. 1986).
The Court held in Closson that the workfare requirement is imposed on a recipient as a
condition for continued eligibility and as there is no contract for hire, an applicant is not
entitled to receive compensation for injury under the Workers’ Compensation Act. Therefore
liability for injuries incurred during the course of a workfare assignment falls directly on the
municipality.
Municipal liability for injured workfare recipients is certainly a cause for concern and
something to be aware of. As a result, prior to establishing a workfare program, a critical
step is to ensure that the municipality’s general liability provider has expressly covered
workfare participants under the municipality’s general liability insurance policy!
Next, it is important for administrators to attempt to match recipients with “appropriate”
work assignments—jobs that match both the physical and mental abilities of the client. This
is important for both reasons of fairness and safety. It would be unwise, for instance, for a
municipality to assign a man with a bad back to woodcutting and hauling heavy brush, or a
woman with heart problems to shovel snow. Also potentially too risky is the use of “power
tools” in workfare assignments. But there are many jobs that do not require heavy work or
power equipment: typing, filing, answering the phone, photocopying, sweeping, raking, etc.
One other critical aspect to remember is that all workfare recipients must be supervised. If a
municipality doesn’t have sufficient staff to supervise recipients it should not require people
to do workfare.
78
This vigilance, which is warranted in the administration of a workfare program, should not
put a damper on establishing or administering a workfare program provided that the
municipality assigns people sensibly and takes the necessary precautions. In summary, with
the proper doses of common sense and imagination the workfare program can be a benefit
both to the municipality and the recipient.
Eligibility Regained
People who violate the work requirement, including workfare, can be found ineligible for
120 days. However, the statute does provide that people may become eligible again during
their 120-day disqualification period “by becoming employed or otherwise complying with
the work requirements.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A (4).
Therefore, if an applicant fails to apply for employment at the local Maine Job Service
office or fails to adequately or in good faith perform a “job search” which the administrator
expressly required, that applicant could be disqualified from the program for 120 days. If a
week later, the same applicant applied for GA and showed the administrator that all job
search requirements had been met; he or she would regain eligibility and be back in the
program.
The purpose of the work-related eligibility requirements is not to arbitrarily punish people.
Instead, the work-related rules are designed to encourage people to make every effort to
reduce or eliminate their reliance on public assistance. Therefore, if people are disqualified
for refusing to look for work or otherwise fulfilling the work requirement, they may regain
their eligibility if they comply with the requirements contained in the ordinance.
Eligibility Regained—Workfare Disqualification
Workfare participants who do not complete their assignment may also regain their
eligibility. A 1991 amendment to § 4316-A(4) provides municipalities with the authority to
limit the number of opportunities a workfare participant must be given to regain eligibility.
The municipality is now required to provide only one opportunity to a workfare participant
to regain eligibility after a workfare failure, but if the participant fails to take advantage of
that single opportunity, without just cause, the municipality can refuse to provide subsequent
opportunities to regain eligibility for the duration of the 120-day ineligibility period.
In spite of the 1991 amendment that limited participants to one single opportunity to regain
eligibility, many welfare directors reported their frustration with some participants who
would get disqualified for a workfare violation, regain their eligibility by taking advantage
79
of the single opportunity provided to them, only to subsequently become disqualified shortly
thereafter and expect yet another opportunity to regain eligibility. In response, a 1993
amendment to that same subsection of law was enacted that established a two-strikes-andyou’re-
out procedure. The 1993 amendment makes it clear that even if a workfare
participant successfully regains his or her eligibility by taking advantage of the single
opportunity to regain, but then commits yet another workfare violation within the 120-day
window of the original ineligibility period, then the administrator shall issue a new 120-day
ineligibility for the subsequent failure, from which there is no opportunity to regain
eligibility (Second Example below).
Example: Jimmy Roth received $255 in GA toward his rent. Jimmy was unemployed and
appeared very willing to perform workfare. The administrator explained the program to
Jimmy and secured his signature on a workfare agreement form. Jimmy was assigned work
at the town’s recycling facility for 7.5 hours for Saturday and Sunday of each weekend for a
total assignment of 60 hours for the next 30 days. The administrator gave Jimmy clear
instructions in writing to call the town office if for any reason he would not be able to
perform his assignment.
On the first Saturday, Jimmy showed up on time but complained all day long to everyone
within hearing distance about the work assignment. He did not show up the next day and he
did not call the designated supervisor as he had been instructed. After being informed about
Jimmy’s failure to do his Sunday workfare, the administrator sent Jimmy a notice of
ineligibility in the mail that formally disqualified Jimmy from receiving GA for the 120-day
period commencing on the first day after the current period of eligibility—for which he had
already received assistance—was over. Jimmy didn’t respond to the notice of ineligibility.
Five weeks later Jimmy applied for GA to cure an eviction notice. The administrator
explained to Jimmy that he was disqualified and therefore ineligible to receive any form of
GA while disqualified. The administrator further explained that Jimmy had one single
opportunity to regain his eligibility. Jimmy said that he wanted the single opportunity, and
he was assigned to work the next available day at the transfer station. He put in a good day’s
work and was readmitted into the GA program. Because Jimmy took himself out of the GA
program for five weeks, the administrator limited his assistance to his deficit only. His
request for more assistance than his deficit was denied because he could have averted the
eviction emergency had he made more appropriate use of his resources; namely, General
Assistance. Fortunately, Jimmy was able to work out a deal with his landlord to avoid
eviction. Because of his uneven work history with the town, the administrator began limiting
Jimmy to 7-day’s worth of GA at a time for a couple of months with weekly workfare
assignments, but Jimmy never again violated his workfare agreement.
80
Example: George Bodwell failed to show up at the High School on October 1, 2000 for his
workfare assignment and he offered no excuse except that he had “girlfriend problems.” The
administrator disqualified George for 120 days, or until January 28, 2001.
In mid-November George reapplied for GA for some heating fuel because he was nearly out.
After being reminded of his ineligibility, George said that he wanted to get back in the
program and was willing to perform the workfare assignment. The administrator informed
George that he would have to successfully perform the workfare assignment before he could
become eligible for assistance. George said his lawyer told him that the town could not
withhold emergency assistance while a person did a workfare assignment. The administrator
explained that the law regarding the withholding of emergency GA pending workfare
performance applied only to people who were eligible for GA, and until George made up the
workfare assignment, he was categorically ineligible for any type of GA.
George agreed to perform the assignment, went to the High School that evening and the
next, completely caught up on his workfare assignment, and regained his eligibility. The fuel
oil was provided, as well as some food and personal care assistance that George requested.
A month later, on December 15, George again applied for GA, this time for rent. The
administrator granted George the assistance he was eligible for and gave him a workfare
assignment, this time at the Public Works garage. The Road Commissioner called the
administrator the next day to let her know that George stopped by the garage just long
enough to tell anyone that would listen that “there was no way he was going to do anything
for the stupid town.”
Because this second violation of workfare fell within the original 120-day disqualification
period (October 1 through January 28), the administrator formally disqualified George for a
new 120-day period, from December 16 through April 15, and that he would be given no
opportunity to regain his eligibility during that period of time. Had George’s second
workfare violation occurred after the original 120-day period of ineligibility (i.e., sometime
after January 28), he would still be disqualified, but a single opportunity to regain eligibility
would be available to him.
Workfare & Recovery
In the Closson decision cited above, the Maine Supreme Court characterized the essential
purpose of workfare as a GA program requirement to secure a recipient’s future eligibility
for GA rather than an exchange of service for compensation or remuneration. On the other
hand, workfare participants do contribute their labor at a rate which is designed by law to at
81
least conform to the prevailing minimum wage. To be in compliance with DHHS’s recordkeeping
requirements, a careful record should be kept of all GA which a participant “works
off” satisfactorily. In addition, as a matter of fairness, the workfare participant should be
informed that the municipality will not be seeking recovery for the portion of the assistance
“worked off” (i.e., workfare performed). (For further discussion on the issue of “Recovery
of Expenses” see Chapter 8.)
As a related issue, a municipality, which has issued GA for a mortgage or capital
improvement payment, may place a lien on that property (see “Mortgages,” see Chapter 7).
The municipality must deduct from the lien amount any satisfactorily performed workfare
(at a rate of at least minimum wage) and formally discharge the lien if and when the entire
value of the mortgage assistance has been worked off.
SSI Interim Assistance Agreements
The Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to recover GA issued to a
recipient who is waiting for the determination of SSI eligibility. Under the terms of the socalled
SSI “Interim Assistance Agreement” program that has been instituted between the
state and federal governments, any GA that has been issued to a person who has applied for
SSI and is waiting for a determination of eligibility may be recovered from that person’s
initial, retroactive SSI check if such a check is subsequently issued by the Social Security
Administration to the individual. The way this process works, the retroactive SSI check is
mailed directly to DHHS instead of the recipient, and DHHS has ten days to remove from
that check any amount of GA that was issued to the recipient after the date he or she was
found to be disabled and therefore, eligible for SSI. DHHS reimburses the municipality their
portion and the remainder of the retroactive check is then immediately sent to the SSI
recipient.
NOTE: Due to two 1998 cases, Coker v. City of Lewiston, 1998 Me. 93 and Thompson
et al., v. Commissioner, Department of Health and Human Services and City of Lewiston
(CV-94-509, Me. Super. Ct., Ken., August 28, 1998), DHHS policy currently requires that
the value (calculated at a rate of at least minimum wage) of any workfare performed by the
GA recipient be subtracted or offset from any refund due to the municipality.
Use of Potential Resources
In addition to fulfilling the work requirement, applicants are required to utilize any resource
that will help reduce their need for GA (§ 4317). Resources include any state or federal
assistance program such as TANF, food supplement benefit, or fuel assistance;
unemployment compensation benefits; support from legally liable relatives (parents of
82
children under 25 and spouses), and any other program or source of assistance (see Appendix
11 for a partial list of other potential resources).
Written Notice
After a person files an initial application the administrator must state in the written decision
what potential resources the applicant is required to attempt to obtain as a condition of
receiving future assistance. The recipient must be given at least seven days to secure the
resource.
Eligible applicants cannot be denied assistance while they are waiting to receive the
resource. However, if they do not attempt to secure the resource and they don’t have a good
reason (just cause) for not attempting to obtain the resource, they can be disqualified until
they do make a good faith effort to utilize the resource.
It is important to distinguish potential resources from available resources. A potential
resource is something that may or may not be available to the recipient at some point in the
foreseeable future, while an available resource is something that is available to reduce or
eliminate a person’s need at the time of application or in a timely manner to meet the need.
For example, Phil Johnson had an $800 savings account. He was temporarily laid off from
work and he didn’t want to deplete his savings, so he applied for GA when he needed fuel
and food. Phil had an available resource, his bank account. All he had to do was go to the
bank and withdraw the necessary funds.
This is different from Ingrid Kimball’s case. Her husband left her and their two children
three days ago. Ingrid was not working and had no money so she applied for GA. The
administrator told Ingrid that she was eligible but she would have to apply for TANF, food
supplement benefit, fuel assistance, and attempt to receive support (using DHHS’s Child
Support Enforcement Unit if necessary) from her husband who had a very well paying job.
The administrator gave Ingrid these instructions in writing and told her that if she failed to
follow through on these requirements, she would be ineligible until she did so.
In Ingrid’s case, even though she was eligible for the other various sources of assistance,
they were not available to her at the time she sought GA. She would have to fill out
applications for these programs and there would be a waiting period while her applications
were processed. In the case of support from her husband, even though he had money
available to help Ingrid and her children, if he did not voluntarily give her any support his
income was not actually available and Ingrid would have to initiate legal action against him.
83
Ingrid was entitled to a seven-day written notice to attempt to secure these potential
resources.
Available Charities
Two Superior Court cases in 1987 and 1988 have clarified the issue regarding the
municipality’s ability to require clients to use local charities. In Fjeld v. City of Lewiston,
Androscoggin County #CV-87-4, the Court ruled that it was not permissible under § § 4317
for Lewiston to refer the applicant to the Hope Haven Gospel Mission for his shelter needs.
The Court found that the Mission, in its regular operation, attempted to influence the
religious beliefs of its clients. The Court further found that the applicant was generally
uncomfortable with and unwilling to undergo the religious persuasion. Therefore, the Court
found that the Mission was a resource that was not available to the applicant.
In Bolduc v. City of Lewiston, Androscoggin County #CV-87-248, the Court went even
further. In Bolduc it was decided that because the Legislature had expressly eliminated
“charitable resources” from the list of “potential resources” in § 4317, a municipality could
not require applicants to utilize charitable resources.
The Court found that the list of “potential resources” in § 4317 were all resources “to which
the applicant is legally entitled by statute, contract, or court order.” When Fjeld and Bolduc
are considered together, it is apparent that municipalities cannot avoid granting the GA for
which the applicants are eligible by referring the applicants to private charities unless the
applicants are willing to utilize the charities or the municipality has established a
contractual relationship with the charities by paying for the service the charity provides.
It is highly advisable, therefore, for municipal officials to get together with local charitable
organizations in order to develop agreements whereby the municipality can utilize the
charity’s services in exchange for either core lump sum funding or pre-arranged per-diem or
per-unit rates, or both. Obviously, part of those agreements would prohibit the charity from
requiring any religious observance or affiliation, or otherwise violating the recipient’s
constitutional rights.
Rehabilitation Services
Applicants who have physical or mental disabilities can be required to take advantage of
any medical or rehabilitative resources that are recommended by a physician, psychologist,
or other retraining or rehabilitation specialist.
84
For example, Delores Cote was working as a waitress until she was in a car accident. As a
result of the accident she was out of work for three months and received GA during that
time. Finally, the doctor told Ms. Cote that she could go to work provided that she was not
on her feet more than four hours a day and didn’t lift heavy objects. He told her explicitly
that she could not be a waitress. When she reapplied for assistance, Ms. Cote told the GA
administrator what the doctor had said. The administrator informed Ms. Cote that she must
start looking for work. Ms. Cote said she wasn’t trained to be anything but a waitress. The
administrator told her to sign up for vocational rehabilitation so that she could receive
education and training to help her find a job. Ms. Cote did not have her high school diploma
and was embarrassed at the thought of having to be trained at her age, but she told the
administrator that she would sign up for training. When she applied the following week, she
had not gone to the vocational rehabilitation office. The administrator disqualified Ms. Cote
until she did apply. The following day, Ms. Cote mustered her courage to talk with a worker
at the vocational rehabilitation office. Ms. Cote took some aptitude tests that showed that
she had an aptitude for working with computers. A new training session would be starting in
six weeks and she signed up to be a member of that class. That same day she went to
provide the GA administrator proof that she went to the vocational rehabilitation office and
that she would be attending the training session and as a result, the administrator completed
a new application and granted Ms. Cote assistance.
Forfeiture of Other Program Benefits—Coordination with GA
Maine law states that not only are applicants responsible for using any available or potential
resource that will diminish their need for GA, but they cannot receive GA to replace any
public benefits they had received but then lost due to fraud or an intentional violation of the
program rules.
For instance, Jolene Brown had been receiving GA plus $80 a week in VA benefits. Later
she was disqualified from receiving his VA benefit because of fraud. Jolene applied for GA,
as usual, and informed the administrator that she had lost her VA benefit. The administrator
called the Veterans Administration to find out why she had lost the benefit. When she
determined that Jolene had committed fraud, the administrator informed her that she would
not receive GA to replace the lost VA benefit. She would receive the same amount of GA
benefits as she had received in the past but she would have a total of $80 less a week (her
lost VA benefit) to live on. In other words, the administrator included the amount of the lost
VA benefit as part of the household income as if she were in fact still receiving them. In the
future, the administrator will continue to consider Jolene’s lost benefits as available to her
for as long as she does not receive them.
85
It should be noted that there are many reasons why the benefit levels distributed by other
programs are reduced. Many if not most of those reductions in benefits are for reasons that
are not associated with any fraud or acts of bad faith on the part of the recipient. The way
the GA law dealing with forfeiture of income reads (§ 4317, third paragraph), the recipient
has forfeited income if the reason for the benefit reduction in the other assistance program
was caused by “fraud, misrepresentation or a knowing or intentional violation of program
rules, or a refusal to comply with program rules without just cause.” Municipal GA
administrators, therefore, should be very careful not to jump to the conclusion that a
reduction in TANF benefit, for example, for reason of “overpayment” is necessarily a
forfeiture of income. It frequently requires some communication with DHHS or whatever
agency is issuing the benefits to determine if the reduction in benefit was caused by client
bad faith.
It should also be noted that this sanction applies primarily to fraud or other acts of bad faith
committed with regard to other public assistance programs, such as TANF or SSI. Fraud
committed in the GA program is discussed immediately below.
Fraud
Any person who commits fraud in an effort to receive GA faces two possible penalties:
? he or she will be ineligible for assistance for 120 days and will be required to
reimburse the municipality for the assistance he/she was not entitled to receive; and
? he or she may be prosecuted for committing a Class E crime which carries a penalty of
a maximum $500 fine and a prison sentence not to exceed 1 year.
It is a case of fraud when anyone “knowingly and willfully” makes a false statement of a
material fact for the purpose of causing himself or any other person to be eligible for GA
(§ 4315).
“Knowingly & Willfully” Standard
This standard of “knowingly and willfully” is a very difficult standard to meet as evidenced
by an April 1997, Maine Supreme Court decision, Ranco v. City of Bangor, 1997 Me. 65. In
Ranco, GA recipients who had been disqualified from eligibility for 120 days for violating
the GA statute’s ‘false representation’ provision, appealed the determination and the Bangor
operations committee (FHA) upheld the disqualification. The FHA’s determination was
vacated upon appeal to the Superior Court by the Rancos and the City of Bangor
consequently appealed to the Supreme Court.
86
The issue in Ranco was whether the standard of “knowingly and willfully” was satisfied by
the Rancos omitting information on their GA application regarding the existence of a house
guest, who was residing in their home. While a house guest of the Rancos’, the house guest
himself applied for GA with the assistance of Cindy Ranco, subsequent to the Ranco’s
application. The city asserted the argument that the recipient’s specific purpose in failing to
disclose the house guest’s presence was to preserve their potential eligibility for benefits
afforded to separate one and two person households instead of the lesser amount allowed to
a three person household.
The Supreme Court held that there was “no indication that (the house guest) attempted to or
was counseled to attempt to become qualified for the higher amount.” The fact that the
representations made by applicants during the interviews were made for the purpose of
obtaining a larger amount of GA was according to Court, “not supported by the record.”
Material Fact
A material fact is any information that has a direct bearing on the applicant’s eligibility for
GA. For example, if an applicant didn’t disclose that he was receiving unemployment
compensation that would be fraud. However, if an applicant reported that he had been out of
work for six months, but it had really been nine months, that misinformation doesn’t
necessarily have a direct bearing on his eligibility therefore it would not be considered fraud.
If the GA administrator believes a person has committed fraud, the administrator cannot
deny the request for assistance solely because an applicant made a false statement without
first giving the applicant an opportunity to appeal the decision to the Fair Hearing
Authority.
In practice, the administrator usually discovers fraud after assistance has been granted since
if a person made a false representation on the application and the administrator discovered it
prior to rendering a decision during the 24-hour period, the administrator would deny the
request if there was no need, or grant only a portion of the assistance the person was eligible
for plus disqualify the applicant due to fraud (first example below).
However, if a person’s request for GA was approved and the administrator later discovered
that the recipient had committed fraud, the administrator would be required to notify the
recipient that his assistance would be terminated but that the recipient could appeal the
decision prior to the termination (second example below). Remember that even if a
household member is disqualified, eligible dependents may receive GA (third example
below).
87
Example: Michael Martin applied for assistance in Montville. He said he had recently
moved from Holden. He told the administrator that he had been unemployed for over a year
and his unemployment compensation had expired a month ago. Although he collected food
stamps, he received no income. He requested help with rent and utilities. The administrator
informed Mike of the various specific sources that would be contacted to verify his
application, and told him to return the next day for the decision on his request.
After he left, the administrator called the GA administrator in Holden to find out if Mike had
received GA there and to verify the information on the application. The Holden
administrator said Mike had left Holden seven months earlier because he said he had been
hired to work at the K-Mart in Montville. The administrator contacted K-Mart to determine
if Mike was working there. The store manager confirmed that Mike started working there
seven months ago. The manager also volunteered that he was a very diligent employee and
earned $8.00 an hour.
When Mike returned the next day for the decision on his request for assistance, the
administrator questioned him again about his assertion that he had no income. Mike said he
did not, but he was hopeful about finding a job. The administrator then denied Mike’s
request for assistance because his income exceeded the maximum levels. The administrator
also disqualified him for 120 days for fraud because he had knowingly and willfully made
false representations. The administrator told Mike he had the right to appeal the decision,
and provided Mike with the Town’s decision in writing.
Example: Greg Thompson had been receiving GA for nearly a year. He said he had no
income because he was disabled and his attempts to receive SSI had failed. However, the
administrator was suspicious because she noticed that Greg always seemed to be in
restaurants or at social gatherings. Finally the administrator decided to send inquiries to a
number of state and federal social service agencies to see if there was anything they could
do for Greg. One day the administrator received a call from the Veterans Administration
(VA) and learned that Greg had been collecting over $200 a month from the VA for the past
three years.
The administrator notified Greg that she had learned that he was receiving an income; that
he would be disqualified from receiving GA for 120 days; that he would have to repay the
assistance he was not entitled to receive; and that he had the right to appeal the decision to
the Fair Hearing Authority. The administrator could not revoke, or terminate any GA which
had been issued to Greg, however, until he had the opportunity for a fair hearing. Again, a
88
written decision describing the municipality’s decision and Greg’s right to appeal was
provided to the applicant.
Example: Mary Jo Harris and her two children recently moved to Sullivan. She told the GA
administrator that she received the food supplement benefit and $418 in TANF, but she used
her entire TANF to pay the security deposit and part of the first month’s rent. She requested
GA to pay the balance of the rent; she also needed personal supplies. Mary Jo had received
GA when she lived in Eastport so she knew she had to present documentation to the
administrator. Based on all the information she presented, the administrator granted Mary
Jo’s request.
Later, the administrator learned that Mary Jo lived with a man and his two children, and that
he was working. Because she had not reported this, the administrator wrote to Mary Jo,
confronted her with this information, said she would be disqualified from receiving
assistance for 120 days, said she would have to repay the town for the amount of assistance
she was not entitled to receive, and informed her that she could appeal to the Fair Hearing
Authority.
Mary Jo appealed the decision. The FHA denied her appeal because she had committed
fraud by not reporting other household members and income. Even though Mary Jo was
disqualified, however, the children might be eligible for assistance depending on the
household’s income and expenses.
Repayment
Once the Fair Hearing Authority determines that a recipient has committed fraud, the
recipient is required to repay the municipality for the amount of assistance he or she was not
eligible to receive. Recipients will not necessarily be required to repay the entire amount
they received but only the amount they were not entitled to receive.
For instance, Roberta Violette reported $100 income and $500 expenses. Roberta’s unmet
need was $400, but because her deficit was calculated at only $208 (overall maximum of
$308 minus $100 income), $208 worth of GA was issued to Roberta’s landlord. During the
course of some follow-up verification, the administrator learned that Roberta actually
received a 30-day income of $250. The administrator disqualified her for fraud and she
requested a fair hearing. The Fair Hearing Authority reaffirmed Roberta’s 120-day
disqualification and ordered her to repay. The Fair Hearing Officer calculated the repayment
requirement at $150 after finding that Roberta received $208 in GA but was only eligible to
receive her deficit of $58 ($208 minus $58 = $150).
89
Period of Ineligibility
Once it is determined that a person has committed fraud, the administrator should
immediately disqualify the applicant from receiving assistance for 120 days. A common
question concerns how to determine when the period of ineligibility commences. Because
no one can be denied assistance or have his/her assistance terminated solely for committing
fraud, prior to being given an opportunity to appeal the disqualification to the Fair Hearing
Authority, the disqualification period begins:
1. the day after the person’s right to appeal the disqualification ends (i.e. on the fifth
working day after a person has received notice that he or she can appeal the decision); or
2. the day the Fair Hearing Authority renders its decision that the person has committed
fraud; or
3. if the period covered by a GA grant has not ended by the time the recipient’s right to
appeal the decision has expired or by the time the Fair Hearing Authority renders its
decision, the 120 day disqualification period commences the last day of the grant period.
Example: Steve had received assistance over the past three months. He told the
administrator that he had been laid-off. Later the administrator learned that he had been
working regularly since he was laid off, but was receiving his pay under the table. Steve was
no longer receiving assistance, nevertheless the administrator notified him that he had to
repay the assistance, that he would be ineligible to receive assistance for 120 days, and that
he had a right to appeal the decision by September 9 (which was five working days from the
date he received the written decision from the administrator).
Steve did not request a fair hearing by September 9; therefore, because he was not receiving
assistance currently, his 120-day disqualification period started September 10, the day after
his appeal rights expired.
Example: Betsy Bowden received a week’s worth of food and one week’s rent three weeks
ago. The GA administrator in Mexico notified her that because she had committed fraud she
would be ineligible for GA for 120 days. The administrator informed her of her rights and
Betsy appealed. The Fair Hearing Authority confirmed the finding of fraud and issued its
decision April 17. Betsy was ineligible for 120 days starting April 17, since the one-week
period her GA grant covered had passed.
Example: On May 1, Margie Wren and her two children received a month’s worth of rent,
food, fuel and personal supplies. Ten days after granting the request the GA administrator
90
discovered that Margie had committed fraud. He notified Margie and informed her of her
right to appeal. Margie appealed that day. On May 16, the Fair Hearing Authority rendered
its decision that Margie had committed fraud. Because Margie had received assistance for
the entire month of May; however, her 120-day disqualification period did not start until
June 1, the first day not covered by the month’s worth of assistance already issued.
Further Appeal
The claimant may appeal any decision made by the Fair Hearing Authority to the Maine
Superior Court, pursuant to Rule 80B of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4315.
Fraud Committed by Non-Applicants
Any person who knowingly and willfully makes a false representation for the purpose of
causing a person applying for GA to be granted assistance is guilty of a Class E crime. For
instance, if the administrator called a relative, co-worker, or landlord to verify the
information provided by the applicant in accordance with verification procedures, and that
third party lied to cover the applicant’s false information, that third party could be
prosecuted for fraud along with the applicant.
Unemployment Fraud
22 M.R.S.A. § § 4317 is the statute that governs the use of potential resources other than
GA. Consistent with this statute, an individual who is declared ineligible for unemployment
compensation benefits because of a finding of fraud by the Maine Department of Labor
pursuant to 26 M.R.S.A. § 1051(1) is ineligible to receive General Assistance to replace the
lost unemployment benefits. The duration of the forfeiture of unemployment benefits is
established by the Department of Labor and it is this period of time that the GA
administrator should use when calculating benefits. To be clear, unemployment benefits
will be considered as available to a client in calculating GA benefits when the client has lost
unemployment benefits due to fraud.
91
CHAPTER 4 – Dependents
The GA law imposes eligibility conditions on recipients that they must fulfill if they expect
to receive further assistance. However, the law also provides that dependents who can’t care
for themselves will be eligible even if a household member is disqualified. Dependents are
members of the household who are not capable of working such as:
? dependent minor children;
? ill, elderly or disabled person;
? a person whose presence is required in order to provide care for a child under six years
old, or for an ill or disabled household member. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4309(3).
There is a distinction between “failure to comply with the law” and being “ineligible” for
assistance because the household has adequate income. If the responsible adults of the
household violate the law and are found “ineligible” for not fulfilling the work requirement,
not attempting to obtain potential resources, committing fraud, or because they are fugitives
from justice, their dependents are eligible if there is insufficient household income to meet
the dependents’ needs, in accordance with the ordinance maximums. This section does not
apply to households that have sufficient income and are ineligible because there is no need.
The dependents would not be eligible to receive assistance except in unavoidable emergency
situations.
Example: John and Liz York and their three children ages three, five and seven have been
receiving assistance off and on during the last several months. Liz has not worked because
she had to care for her children; John worked pumping gas at a service station. John decided
to quit work because he was frustrated over his “dead-end” job. When he applied for
assistance the administrator disqualified John for 120 days because he quit his job without
“just cause.” The administrator granted assistance to Liz and the three children for one week
because they were dependents. The amount of assistance was based on a family of five, less
the pro-rata share of the disqualified person (John). However, the administrator said that
since John wasn’t working, he could take care of the children and Liz would have to fulfill
the work requirement, including workfare. If John found work he would regain his
eligibility.
Although Liz agreed to do workfare, she never showed up to work. The administrator
disqualified Liz, in addition to John, because she didn’t have just cause for not doing
workfare. Even though Liz and John were both disqualified the administrator had to assist
the three young children.
92
In the case of Liz and John the household continued to receive GA even though it was a
reduced amount (for a household five, reduced by the pro-rata share of the two disqualified
individuals (John and Liz). Although the assistance was intended solely for the children,
obviously their parents could benefit from it. The intent behind this section of the law,
however, is to penalize the parents without making the children suffer for their parents’
actions by being deprived of their assistance.
Example: Sandra Mitchell takes care of her 73-year-old mother who has Alzheimer’s
disease. Sandra is healthy and could work but she has to stay home to care for her mother
since Sandra can’t afford to pay someone else to care for her. Sandra and her mother are
eligible, even though Sandra is able to work, because she is the only person available to care
for her mother.
Example: George Lowe and his 17-year-old son, Michael, live in Lincoln. The Lowes had
received assistance for about eight months. When classes ended in June for summer
vacation, the administrator told Michael that he would have to get a summer job or do
workfare. Michael refused saying he was on vacation from school and he shouldn’t have to
work. The administrator disqualified Michael because he was able to work but refused to
work without just cause. His father continued to be eligible.
When determining eligibility of the household members who are not disqualified, the
administrator should keep the overall maximum and category maximum at the same level
but reduce that amount by the share of the disqualified person. Take, for example, a
household of four where one member is disqualified for 120 days for committing fraud. They have
no income and are requesting help with their $500 a month rent. The overall maximum for a
household of four is $800. Only three quarters of the household is eligible to receive assistance so
therefore the overall maximum would be 3/4 of $800 = $600. They would qualify for 3/4 of the
rental expense, their rental eligibility would be 3/4 of $500 = $375.00.
Liability of Relatives
Maine law had long required that relatives be liable for the support of members of their
family. Parents and grandparents who were financially able were considered a resource and
were expected to support their children or grandchildren regardless of their ages. In fact, up
until 1984, the obligation of relatives to support each other was a two-way street; children
and grandchildren were expected to support their elders when necessary. The Legislature
eliminated the responsibility of children and grandchildren to care for their elders in 1984—
except with respect to funeral expenses (P.L. 1983, ch. 701, 22 M.R.S.A. § § 4313, 4319).
And in 1989, the Legislature limited the liability of support to only the parents of children
under the age of 21—again, except in the area of burial expenses (P.L. 1989, ch. 370).
93
The most recent development in the evolution of a parent’s financial liability for the support
of his or her children, as that responsibility coordinates with the GA program, was enacted
on June 30, 1993. In a partial return to pre-1989 parental liability for support, GA law now
establishes a parental liability for support for any applicant applying independently who is
less than 25 years of age. Furthermore, a spouse’s liability for support is also clearly
established.
Other relatives—brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, parents of applicants over 25 years
of age, etc.—are not legally liable for each other’s support but should be encouraged to help
their relatives to the best of their ability.
There are four sections in the state law which pertain—directly or indirectly—to the liability
of relatives:
? § 4309(4) (Eligibility of minors who are parents)
? § 4319 (Liability of relatives)
? § 4317 (Use of potential resources)
? § 4313(2) (Burial and cremation responsibilities of legally liable relatives)
§ 4309(4)
In 1991, the Legislature inserted into both AFDC (now TANF) law and GA law a provision
which was intended to address a design of AFDC law which, unintentionally, was providing
an incentive for young AFDC mothers or mothers-to-be to leave the homes of their parents
in order to receive AFDC benefits. In GA law, that provision is now found at § 4309(4). It
provides that as a general rule minors who don’t live with parents or guardians are
completely ineligible to receive GA if they are:
1. 17 years of age or younger;
2. have never been married; and
3. have dependent children, or are pregnant.
As is often the case in GA law, this general rule has a number of exceptions. Those
exceptions are when a minor is otherwise eligible and:
? when such a minor is living in a foster home, maternity home or other “adultsupervised
supportive living arrangement”;
94
? when the minor’s parents are not living or their whereabouts are unknown;
? when the minor’s parents are unwilling to permit the minor to live in their home;
? when the minor has lived independently of the parents for at least one year prior to the
birth of any dependent child;
? when DHHS determines that the minor or the minor’s children would be jeopardized by
living with the minor’s parents; or
? when DHHS determines, in accordance with DHHS regulation, that the general
ineligibility for GA should be waived.
Furthermore, the general rule of ineligibility must be waived whenever the minor’s parents
verify that their child had been living independently from them for a year prior to the birth
of the minor’s dependent child.
Finally, DHHS has the authority to require the town to provide the minor with GA after
making a finding that the minor or her child would be jeopardized if found ineligible. The
law expressly gives DHHS the responsibility of making the determination of jeopardy;
therefore, the municipal administrator should seek DHHS advice or inform the minor
applicant that she may seek DHHS intervention whenever the issue of jeopardy arises.
§ 4319
This provision of law now requires that parents provide support to their children under the
age of 25, and that spouses support each other “in proportion to their respective ability.” As
an aside, parents remain responsible for their “emancipated” children under GA standards.
In certain circumstances, the parental liability to support a minor or young adult applicant
can lead to a denial of that applicant’s GA request on the grounds that the applicant has “no
need.”
Generally, however, this section of law merely allows a municipality to recover the cost of
assisting a person by suing the parent(s) or spouse in any court of competent jurisdiction,
such as Small Claims Court, if the parents or spouse refuse to help their relatives. (Keep in
mind that in order for the suit to be successful, the liable relatives must be financially able to
contribute and either reside in or own property in Maine.)
If such a suit is brought, the court can summon the relatives and order them to repay the
municipality which has expended money for their relatives’ support. If the court determines
95
that the relatives who are sued had sufficient financial ability to support their relatives, the
court could require them to pay a “reasonable sum” to reimburse the town. The suit can
recover only those expenditures made during the previous 12 months. Therefore, if Albion
had granted assistance to Mr. and Mrs. Decker’s daughter during the past 18 months, the
most the municipality could recover would be expenses made during the prior 12 months,
not the entire 18-month period.
The Enforcement of Parental Liability
An administrator cannot assume that parents are providing appropriate support to their
children merely because they are required to do so by law. First of all, parents are only
obligated to support their children under GA law “in proportion to their respective ability.”
Therefore, if the parents are impoverished, their support for independent minor or young
adult children cannot be required. Furthermore, it may be the case that the parents are
financially able to provide the necessary support, but for one reason or another they are not
providing it.
§ 4319 does not allow administrators to flatly deny applications made by minors or young
adults or otherwise reduce the levels of assistance for which such an applicant may be
eligible on the grounds that the parents are legally required to support the minor. As
discussed above, the process envisioned by § 4319 is primarily a process of recovery.
With this in mind, when a minor or young adult applies for GA, the administrator should
make at least two determinations. First, are the applicant’s parents willing and able to
provide their children with his/her basic necessities? If this is the case, and the administrator
has no reason to suspect that the parental home is a dangerous or unhealthy environment for
the child, then the minor’s application could be denied on the basis of “no need.”
However, if either the minor or the minor’s parents are able to contribute sufficient evidence
to suggest that the parental home is not available to the minor because of space problems,
lack of resources, because the parents threw the child out of the house, or because of
suspected emotional or physical child abuse, the administrator should process the minor’s
application in essentially the same manner as an adult’s application.
At this point, the second determination should be made, which is whether the minor’s
parents are financially capable (i.e., are they are employed, do they have adequate
discretionary income, do they own significant assets, are they on public assistance, etc.). If a
determination is made that the parents are financially capable of providing support, the
municipality should notify the parents of their financial responsibility to provide for their
96
child under the GA program. If necessary, parents should be informed that the municipality
will seek to collect any assistance granted to their child through civil action (e.g., small
claims court) if the parent does not comply.
Obviously, the financial issue of parental liability is not the only issue regarding GA and
minors which concerns administrators. Many GA administrators are reluctant to grant
assistance to minors that enable the minors to live in potentially unstable or unhealthy
circumstances. In 1989, the Maine Welfare Directors’ Association and Pine Tree Legal
Assistance coordinated their efforts in a piece of legislation which would have provided
some fundamental case management to minors receiving GA through the Department of
Health and Human Services. That legislative initiative was killed because of the price tag
attached.
Minors, GA & Municipal Liability
Another major concern shared by administrators is the perception that the municipality or
the administrators personally could be held liable in the event their granting of assistance
somehow led to or contributed to the minor’s injury or death. Actually, this concern is
unfounded.
The Maine Tort Claims Act (14 M.R.S.A. § 8101 et seq.) provides ample protection from
such liability. For example, 14 M.R.S.A. § 8111 holds in part that “[t]he absolute immunity
[from personal civil liability]...shall be available to all governmental employees, including
police officers and governmental employees involved in child welfare cases, who are
required to exercise judgment or discretion in performing their official duties.”
As a supplement to this provision of immunity in Title 14, in 1991 the Legislature amended
§ 4318 in Title 22 to read “a municipality that provides general assistance to a minor is
absolutely immune from suit on any Tort Claims seeking recovery or damages by or on
behalf of the minor recipient in connection with the provision of general assistance.”
Rental Payments to Relatives
The Legislature established in 1989 that a municipality has no legal obligation under GA
law to provide a rental payment to an applicant’s parents (§ 4319(2)). This authority to deny
a request for a rental payment to a parent was expanded in 1991 so that an administrator
may now choose not to make a rental payment to the applicant’s parents, grandparents,
child, grandchild, sibling, parent’s sibling or any of those relatives’ children.
97
Under this section of GA law, the administrator may choose to deny the request for rental
assistance to a relative-landlord regardless of the age of the GA applicant and regardless of
whether the relative-landlord lives in the same home as the applicant or lives elsewhere. As
is usually the case with GA law, there is an exception to the general rule authorizing the
denial of rental assistance paid to relatives.
The exception is if the rental relationship between the applicant and the applicant’s relative
was three months old or older and the relatives can demonstrate eligibility for GA if the
applicant’s rent were not paid to them. It is only when both of these two standards are met
that the administrator would have to consider paying the rent to the relatives in accordance
with standard eligibility criteria.
§ 4317
While § 4319 applies primarily to liable relatives who refuse to support their dependents,
§ 4317, the section of law making applicants responsible for securing “potential resources,”
pertains to parents or spouses who are both able and willing to help their relatives. Section
4317 requires applicants to utilize any resource which would reduce or eliminate their need
for GA.
Liable relatives are considered “potential resources” for the purpose of this section, and the
GA applicant would be required in writing to make a good faith effort to secure the liable
relative’s direct assistance. At the point in time the liable relative expressed a willingness to
provide direct support, that relative would become an “available resource,” and the
applicant’s need for GA would evaporate. If the relatives are not both able and willing to
provide direct assistance, the applicant cannot be penalized for failing to make use of the
resource.
Example: Nineteen-year-old Rebecca Golden was angry at her parents because they
complained about the way she smoked and stayed out at night. Although she had been
looking for a job for weeks, Rebecca hadn’t found one. However, she couldn’t stand living
with her parents any longer, so Rebecca went to the town office to apply for GA to help her
move. The administrator denied her request because Rebecca’s parents said they were
willing to have her live at home, and Rebecca had no need for shelter.
Example: Twenty year old Gary Beaulieu had been employed at a paper mill until two
months ago when he was laid-off. He applied for GA for his first time to get help with his
rent and light bill. The administrator asked why he couldn’t live with his parents, who lived
in town, until he got another job. Gary explained that his parents could barely make ends
98
meet now for themselves and four children at home. In fact, Gary said, he had been giving
his parents some money each week until he was laid-off.
After thinking about it, the administrator realized that Gary’s family had received GA from
time-to-time. They lived in a mobile home barely large enough to hold them. The
administrator granted Gary’s request because even though his family would like to help they
had neither the space nor the resources.
Burials
As discussed above, in 1984 the Legislature removed all liability of children and
grandchildren for the support of their parents and grandparents, in 1989 the liability of
parents was limited to the parents of children under 21 years of age, and in 1993 parental
liability for support was extended to allow for the recovery of benefits issued to an applicant
under the age of 25 years.
None of these changes in the law affected the liability of grandparents, parents, siblings,
children and grandchildren to pay for the burial costs of each other, whenever these relatives
are financially able. In 2007, however, the Legislature removed “siblings” from the list of
surviving liable relatives (§ 4313(2)). When a person dies without having made burial
provisions and without resources or sufficient estate to cover basic burial or cremation costs,
any surviving liable relatives (parents, grandparents, children or grandchildren) of
sufficient ability would be responsible for the burial costs (§ 4313). The way this type of
financial responsibility to bury relatives is generally enforced by the municipality is to
simply deny any request for burial assistance to the extent legally liable relatives have been
identified who live or own property in Maine and who appear to have a financial capacity to
pay for the burial/cremation, either in lump sum or installment payments. (For more
information on “burials,” see Chapter 7.)
99
CHAPTER 5 – Verification
Verification, or certifying that applicants are eligible for assistance, is one of the
administrator’s most important duties. Applicants have the burden of proving that they are
eligible for GA. The applicants must show that they need GA by providing written
documentation such as wage stubs, receipts, and bills. The GA administrator is responsible
for verifying that information (§ 4309). It is not the administrator’s job to do the
groundwork to discover if applicants are eligible.
The administrator does, however, have the obligation to check the accuracy of the
applicants’ statements and documents in order to make sure the applicants are in fact
eligible. The administrator may gather or verify information from other sources provided the
administrator, prior to contacting third parties, informs the applicant (in writing is the
preferred method, see Appendix 17, page 4 of the MMA GA Application) of the sources
which will be contracted. If the applicant refuses to allow the administrator to make a third
party contact, the applicant’s request for GA may be denied.
Generally speaking, the administrator should require applicants to bring certain documents
each time they apply: bills or receipts for rent, utilities, fuel, telephone service, medical
expenses, clothing and evidence of income whether it is earned income or a public benefit
such as TANF or SSI. A requirement that the applicant bring such documentation should be
a part of any use-of-income policy and notice, if the municipality employs such a policy (see
“Use-of-Income Guidelines,” in Chapter 2).
If the application is not an initial application, the administrator should also expect
documentation establishing exactly how the household’s previous 30-day income was spent
(see “Availability of Misspent Income,” in Chapter 2), as well as proof that the applicant has
fulfilled the work requirements and attempted to secure all potential resources.
Requiring applicants to fully document their eligibility can be less strictly required in some
emergency situations, but the municipal authority to limit emergency assistance when the
applicant could have averted the emergency situation clearly authorizes the administrator to
request and expect to receive sufficient documentation to satisfy the applicant’s burden of
proof that the emergency was not self-created (see “Limitations on Emergency GA” in
Chapter 2). Even when verifying documentation is less strictly required in emergency
circumstances (such as a furnace breakdown in the middle of the night), all recipients of
such emergency GA would be expected to bring all necessary documentation as soon as
possible, or at least by the next time they apply. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4310.
100
If an applicant’s information and documentation is incomplete, the administrator should tell
the applicant, in writing, what information is needed for the administrator to make a
decision. If the applicant fails to provide the necessary information within 24-hours and the
administrator can’t determine eligibility, the administrator should deny the application
pending receipt of the necessary information.
Remember, the eligibility period commences upon the administrator’s determination of
eligibility for purposes of the 30-day calculation period.
Example: Mr. Jones (a repeat applicant) applies for GA on the 1st of the month and is
directed (in writing—the preferred method) to bring back pay stubs and expenditure receipts
within 24-hours so that his eligibility can be determined. Mr. Jones does not bring the
documentation as directed. Thus, the GA administrator by law must issue a written decision
(in this case indicating ineligibility due to failure to bring in necessary documentation). Mr.
Jones returns on the 3rd of the month, submitting all the necessary documentation previously
requested of him. The GA administrator must initiate a new application, dated the 3rd, and
the period of eligibility becomes 30 days from the 3rd (not the 1st). On the 4th (24-hours later)
the GA administrator provides Mr. Jones with a new written decision.
Because the burden of proving eligibility rests upon the applicant, the administrator can
require the applicant to present the necessary information, or the administrator can gather
the remaining information personally. However, if an applicant doesn’t provide the
information or refuses to allow the administrator to gather the needed facts to determine
eligibility, the applicant can be denied due to insufficient information. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4309.
People applying for the first time are not required to present as much documentation as
recipients who have received assistance previously. Because need is the primary eligibility
factor at the time of an initial application, people are not required to prove that they have
looked for work, accepted work, or have met other eligibility conditions. They do, however,
have to show that they are in need and must present reasonable documentation of their
income and expenses.
Employment
Applicants must give the administrator proof of their wages. If “first time” applicants do not
provide the necessary information and it is impossible for the administrator to determine
their eligibility, the administrator may deny assistance due to incomplete information and
documentation of eligibility if the request is not an emergency. If it is an emergency, the
administrator should grant sufficient assistance to meet the immediate need. However, in the
101
written decision the administrator should inform the applicant that they must provide the
required documentation in order to receive further assistance. The decision should also state
that if an applicant fails to provide the requested documentation, the administrator may
contact the employer to verify the employment information if the applicant hasn’t provided
the information within seven days.
Employers are required by state law to release employment information upon written
request by a GA administrator. If employers refuse to give the information, they must give a
written explanation stating the reason for the refusal within three days of the request for
information. If employers do not have a good reason for refusing to comply with the request,
they can be fined not less than $25 nor more than $100. In addition, giving the administrator
false information is a Class E crime. 22 M.R.S.A. § § 4314, 4315.
Financial Institutions
Applicants are required to inform the administrator if they have savings or checking
accounts. The administrator may verify this information by making a written request to the
bank, credit union or other financial institution. The bank or financial institution will usually
require a release signed by the applicant to provide the administrator with this information.
If a bank refuses to release this requested information it must give a written decision
explaining why it refused. If the banking institution does not have good reason for refusing
to release the information, it can be fined not less than $25 nor more than $100. 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4314.
State Agencies
The administrator can contact the Department of Health and Human Services and any other
state agency which has any information pertaining to an applicant’s eligibility. Unlike
inquiries to employers and financial institutions, requests for information from state
agencies do not necessarily have to be in writing. Administrators can, for instance, call the
Department of Health and Human Services to find out about an applicant’s TANF or Food
Stamp grant or call the Department of Labor to learn about an applicant’s unemployment
compensation benefits. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4314.
Emergencies & Telephone Applications
In an emergency situation, requiring immediate assistance, the GA administrator may issue
“sufficient benefits to provide the basic necessities needed immediately…” as long as the
following conditions (found in § 4310) are met:
102
? the administrator has determined, on the basis of the interview, that the applicant will
probably be eligible for GA after full verification;
? when possible, the applicant submits adequate documentation to verify that he or she
needs immediate assistance;
? when adequate documentation is not available at the time of application, the
administrator may contact at least one other person to confirm the applicant’s
statement;
? in no case may the authorization of benefits provided under this section exceed 30 days;
and
? in no case may there be further authorization of benefits until a full verification of
eligibility has taken place.
In some cases, emergency applications may be made over the telephone. The administrator
should accept telephone applications when the applicant has an immediate need and neither
he/she nor any person can apply in person due to illness, disability, lack of childcare, no
transportation or other good cause. If an application is taken over the phone, the
administrator still has the obligation to verify the information either by making a visit to the
applicant’s home with his/her consent or having the applicant send or bring in the necessary
information another day. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4304(3).
103
CHAPTER 6 – Confidentiality
It is important to remember that although the administrator must verify the information the
applicant gives, the administrator must keep information relating to the applicant
confidential. No information pertaining to applicants, including their names, information on
their application forms, records of the amount of assistance granted or other communications
can be released to the general public. When attempting to gather information from other
sources, the administrator should not give out any more information than is necessary to
obtain the needed information, and should inform the person that the information is
confidential. If someone calls the administrator to gather information, the same rules apply.
If another GA administrator or a state Human Services worker requests information about a
recipient, the administrator can supply the needed information provided the information is
kept confidential by the government official requesting the information and that official
needs the information for legitimate reasons.
GA records cannot be released to the general public unless a recipient has given consent in
writing. Determining who constitutes a member of the general public, however, can be
problematic for the administrator. Basically, the general public includes anyone who is not a
government official acting in his or her official capacity. In other words if a municipal
official needs information about a GA recipient in order to fulfill her official duty, the
official would not be considered a member of the general public.
Example: Ms. Rogers, a selectperson, asks the GA administrator to show her the GA
records for the last fiscal year. Ms. Rogers is not involved in administering GA but has been
assigned to review the administration of GA in the municipality. She is given the records
because she is entitled to see how municipal monies are spent, but is reminded not to discuss
the records because they are confidential.
Example: Captain Snell, of the Brewer Police department, wants to look at the GA records
to see if she recognizes any names. The GA administrator refuses to give her access to the
records because Captain Snell’s purpose does not directly relate to the performance of her
duty. However, if Captain Snell had told the administrator that the police department was
looking for Sally Jacques on suspicion of armed robbery and wanted her last known address,
the administrator could have provided the recipient’s address.
Example: Ms. Sample has requested a fair hearing. An individual claiming to be an
advocate representing Ms. Sample called the GA administrator to get some information
about the case. The GA administrator refused to disclose any information to the alleged
104
advocate unless and until Ms. Sample gave the administrator specific permission to release
her records to the advocate.
Municipalities should not involve the police department in administering the GA program
for routine matters. The administrator should not give police the assignment of verifying
information on an application or conducting home visits. For instance, the police should not
routinely interview neighbors or landlords to find out who is in the household, and the police
should not set up surveillance to see who enters the applicant’s home. Also the police
shouldn’t accompany administrators while they are doing home visits unless the applicant
has a history of violent or irrational behavior. None of these tasks are an official duty of the
police and they would be considered members of the general public in these instances. The
police may be called in, however, when there is evidence of fraud and the administrator
needs the police to investigate. Furthermore, law enforcement personnel should be
immediately contacted when the administrator is in need of protection or an unruly applicant
needs to be removed from the GA office or engages in or threatens criminal behavior.

Important issues and considerations include:
? Confidentiality of General Assistance Information
105
Although Maine’s “Right to Know” Law (Freedom of Access Act, 1 M.R.S.A. § § 401-412)
provides for public access to public records, certain important exceptions exist to this broad
rule (see Information Packet on “Right to Know”). Among others, “[r]ecords that have
been designated confidential by statute” are accepted from public disclosure (1 M.R.S.A.
§ 402(3)(A)). One example of this is found in the municipal general assistance (GA)
statute—the confidentiality provision at 22 M.R.S.A. § 4306.
Section 4306 provides in part that, “[r]ecords, papers, files and communications relating to
an applicant or recipient made or received by persons charged with the responsibility of
administering” the GA program are “confidential.” Furthermore, this information “may not
be disclosed to the general public, unless expressly permitted by [the applicant or
recipient].”
It is important to note that Section 4306 concerns disclosures made to the “general public”
only and not to government officials acting in an official capacity. Therefore, discussions
with the Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS), other State departments, or
other GA administrators for the purpose of determining eligibility would not be prohibited
under the statute. In addition, because the general public does not include a government
official acting in his or her official capacity, in an instance where a municipal official (i.e.,
selectperson appointed to review GA administration in the municipality) required
information about the town’s GA program or requested information regarding a GA case
which appeared questionable, such an official would not be considered a member of the
general public. On the other hand, if a selectperson was requesting information
unnecessarily or outside the scope of his or her official duty or perhaps was unnecessarily
intrusive into the facts of a case, the GA administrator should remind the selectperson of the
confidentiality of such GA information.
Although GA administrators are responsible for the collection and verification of
information necessary to determine a GA applicant’s eligibility, they are also responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality of this information. Moreover, under 22 M.R.S.A. § 4314
(4), State departments, financial institutions and employers obtaining “…information under
this section [are] subject to the same rules of confidentiality” as the municipality.
Consequently, when a GA administrator communicates with State departments, financial
institutions and employers regarding confidential information obtained during the course of
the general assistance application process, the administrator should remind these parties that
the information discussed is “confidential.” These discussions should be documented, and
106
the fact that a direction of confidentiality was given should be incorporated into the
documentation.
Municipalities should require court ordered subpoenas for the release of GA information if it
is not clear that the release is permitted under the statute.
? GA Information Confidentiality Policy/Agreement
GA administrators are required to keep client information confidential. As a result, they
should periodically remind their employees and other municipal departments that may have
knowledge of a GA application (e.g., finance department) of the duty to maintain GA
information confidentially. Municipalities may wish to incorporate a version of the attached
“GA Information Confidentiality Policy/Agreement” into personnel manuals and have
employees sign the agreement upon being assigned GA duties. While serving as a training
tool and reminder for employees regarding their responsibilities, this policy/agreement also
serves as evidence of a municipality’s “good faith” effort to maintain the confidentiality of
GA records and information.
? Disclosing GA Information
If a GA applicant or recipient wishes to have information in their GA file disclosed to a third
party such as an attorney or other social service provider, Section 4306 requires that the
municipality obtain express permission. Although “express” permission may be interpreted
as “oral” permission, municipalities should obtain this permission in writing (see General
Information Disclosure Form). Janek v. Ives, No. CV-89-116 (Me. Super. Ct., Aro. Cty,
Feb. 14, 1990), specifically confirmed the interpretation that “express” permission may be
interpreted as requiring a writing by a municipality. However, prior to instituting a
requirement for “written” releases, municipalities should incorporate this requirement into
their GA ordinance.
? Medical Information Disclosures
Although most GA client information may be disclosed upon receiving a client’s general
consent, municipalities are strongly encouraged to utilize specific “medical” release forms
when releasing information of a medical nature.
? HIV Information Disclosures
107
In addition to utilizing specific medical information disclosures, municipalities should
consider adopting a policy/practice that further requires a client to provide an additional
“HIV” release for HIV status information contained in a client’s file.
Generally speaking, due to this information’s highly sensitive nature, municipalities should
avoid requiring documents which substantiate an HIV diagnosis. In the event a GA
applicant/recipient has HIV, the HIV status can be described as a “life threatening” illness.
Pertinent information concerning the specifics of the illness can, as necessary, be confirmed
over the course of a telephone conversation. For purposes of GA, whether the person has
HIV or cancer for example is usually not important to the GA eligibility analysis. The GA
issue(s) behind such “life threatening” illnesses usually consist of requests for assistance in
order to purchase expensive medications or the issue of a GA applicant not being able to
meet the “work requirement” due to the illness. As a result, for the purposes of GA,
describing the client as being inflicted with a life threatening illness is generally sufficient.
The relevant provision of law (5 M.R.S.A. § § 19203) requires that a person who is the
subject of an HIV test makes an election in writing whether to authorize the release of that
portion of the medical record containing the HIV infection status information when that
person’s medical record has been requested. It is important to note that Section 19203
appears to apply to health care providers and medical records, with no direct mention of
municipal records. However, it is the opinion of MMA Legal Services staff that because of
the sensitivity of this information, if a municipality is requiring the release of HIV related
information (which is arguably not the best thing to do), it should require a specific HIV
information release in addition to a general medical information release as an added
precaution.
Municipalities requiring the additional HIV release must do so with the understanding that
such a policy of “requiring” the additional release will provide additional protection for the
municipality only if the policy is stringently enforced. Should a municipality adopt such
a policy and then disregard it, the municipality’s risk of liability following illegal or
unauthorized release of information would be heightened. In addition, if a municipality
obtains documentation which verifies a client’s HIV status, then the municipality becomes a
custodian of this information and must guard it accordingly.

CHAPTER 7 – Basic Necessities (Maximum Levels of Assistance)
Maine law defines “basic necessities” as food, clothing, shelter, fuel, electricity, nonelective
medical services as recommended by a physician, non-prescription drugs, telephone
services where it is necessary for medical reasons, and any other commodity or service
determined essential by the municipality. Municipalities must budget in all of the items
defined as basic necessities when determining a person’s unmet need. The law also gives
municipalities the option of including other items that they consider essential depending on
the situation, such as sewer bills, personal supplies, transportation, furniture, and housing
repairs.
Municipalities may establish maximum levels of assistance for each category of basic
necessity to determine if a person is eligible and, if so, how much assistance to grant. Those
maximum levels for each category of basic need should be distinguished from the overall
maximum level of assistance, which represents the largest GA 30-day grant that can be
issued for all the basic necessities put together. Unlike the overall maximums of assistance,
which are somewhat arbitrary, the maximum levels established by ordinance for each basic
necessity must be reasonable and adequate standards sufficient to maintain health and
decency. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(3-A).
The municipal officers are responsible for establishing the maximum levels of assistance as
part of the GA ordinance. (As a service to municipalities, MMA Legal Services Department
generates model figures yearly in the form of Appendices A-C which are sent out in
September to all member municipalities). Prior to 1985, the state law contained no reference
to maximum levels of assistance. Maximum levels of assistance were a concept that
developed informally through practice and case law. Glidden v. Fairfield, (1979) Som.
County Superior Ct., #CV800-431; Verrill v. Augusta, (1982), Kenn. County Superior Ct.
#CV 82-262. Because certain advocates for low-income people have persistently challenged
municipalities’ authority to set maximum levels, the state law was amended to clearly grant
this authority.
DHHS Rules Regarding Maximum Levels
In 1986, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated a rule which required
municipalities, under a “rebuttable presumption,” to adopt as their food maximums the
U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan figures. The “presumption” was that if a municipality’s figures
reflected the Thrifty Food Plan figures, the Department would presume those maximums to
be adequate to maintain health and decency.
110
The “rebuttable” aspect of the rule was that if the municipality could effectively demonstrate
that lower standards were adequate to support the nutritional requirements of a household,
then the Department would accept those lower figures.
The authority of the Department to promulgate such a standard was challenged, and Maine’s
Supreme Court ruled that the Department was within its authority to impose such a
requirement. City of Westbrook v. Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human
Services, 540 A.2d 1118 (Me. 1988). Since the Westbrook case, the Department has
promulgated a similar “rebuttable presumption” rule regarding housing maximums, this time
requiring that municipal housing maximums conform to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) Fair Market Rent statistics.
The MMA model GA ordinance has been in conformance with those statistics since 1987. If
the available housing within a municipality or within the region around a municipality costs
remarkably less than the HUD figures, as reflected in the MMA model ordinance, that
municipality might want to do its own Fair Market Rent survey and establish its own
maximums. The Department’s guidelines for doing a local rent survey simply require that
the municipality conduct a survey of local landlords, and the survey can also make use of
classified advertisements in the newspaper. The DHHS rules also provide that the survey
may not be limited to only those landlords who provide housing to General Assistance
clients because such a survey may produce distorted rent figures.
Maximums & the GA Budget
The maximum levels of assistance established by ordinance should be reviewed regularly by
the administrator to ensure they are adequate for the region, and adjusted when necessary by
ordinance amendment. When determining if applicants are eligible by applying the unmet
need test, the administrator should budget the applicant’s actual 30-day cost for the basic
necessity or the ordinance maximum, whichever is less (see “The Unmet Need Test,” in
Chapter 2).
For example, if the ordinance allows a maximum rental amount of $375 for two people but
the applicants only pay $355 for rent, the administrator would budget the lower amount
($355). The amount that is budgeted in, by the administrator, for a particular basic necessity
is the allowed need for that necessity. If, as a result of the application process, it is
determined that the applicant is eligible for GA, assistance can be granted up to the “allowed
need” for any basic necessity.
111
In some circumstances the administrator may feel it necessary to consolidate the applicant’s
unmet need and apply it all toward a single basic necessity. In other words, the administrator
can exceed the maximum amount allowed for a basic necessity, provided the administrator
does not exceed the client’s total eligibility.
For example, Joshua Holbrook has exhausted his income on basic needs, but he has no
money left over to pay the light bill. Joshua applies for assistance, and the administrator
determines that Joshua is eligible for $100 worth of assistance over the next 30 days. The
administrator could elect to issue from Joshua’s $100 overall eligibility only $60 for the
light bill because $60 represents the ordinance maximum for that basic need, and the
applicant is in no emergency situation which could dictate exceeding that amount. If the
administrator took that course of action, Joshua would remain eligible for the remaining $40
of his deficit for the other basic necessities, provided that within the next 30 days there was
an actual need for them. On the other hand, the administrator could elect to issue the entire
amount of Joshua’s eligibility to the electric company. In the absence of an emergency need
for utility assistance, the administrator could not be forced to consolidate Joshua’s unmet
need in this manner, but in some cases an administrator may feel such a decision would
make more sense.
MMA’s model GA ordinance contains some standards governing the practice of
consolidating an applicant’s unmet need/deficit.
The following is a discussion of the various basic necessities.
Food
As discussed above, the ordinance maximums for food are now governed by DHHS
regulation that essentially requires municipalities to adopt the U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan.
When budgeting a person’s need for food, the administrator must automatically budget the
maximum amount allowed in the ordinance for food. This is recommended for three specific
reasons. First, everyone must have food to survive. Second, most GA recipients receive food
stamps but this benefit cannot be included as income. By including the full maximum
allowed for food, the municipality is protected from being accused of including the food
supplement benefit as income. Many administrators object to being required to disregard the
food supplement benefit, but this is a federal law. The purpose of the federal Food Stamps
Act is to provide eligible households with an opportunity to obtain a more nutritionally
adequate diet. GA and other welfare benefits cannot be reduced due to the household’s
receipt of the food supplement benefit. 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). Finally, DHHS regulation now
112
requires that administrators budget all applicants at full food allowance levels (DHHS
General Assistance Policy Manual, Section 1V).
Municipalities are permitted to adopt a list of approved food items which people may
purchase with their GA vouchers and to restrict the purchase of certain items. The recipient
should be given a copy of approved or unacceptable items. In order for this to be effective,
the municipality needs the cooperation of the supermarket. Also, municipal food and
personal care vouchers, at the present time, are not exempt from state sales tax.
Housing
When budgeting for housing, the administrator should use the actual expense for rent or
mortgage up to the maximum amount allowed. It is the applicants’ responsibility to locate
and obtain housing that is within their ability to pay.
However, some people can’t afford any housing due to the lack or insufficiency of income.
In these cases the administrator should inform applicants about the maximum amount
allowed for housing and direct them to attempt to find housing within that amount.
Notwithstanding the regulatory requirement that the housing minimum reflect the HUD
standards, the maximum amounts must also realistically reflect the expenses in the area and
if they do not they should be amended.
Municipalities generally provide current rental payments rather than grant assistance for
“back bills.” The administrator should tell this to applicants the first time they apply, and
also include it in the written decision, so that the applicants are clearly aware of this
practice.
Furthermore, GA rental assistance should be provided so as to secure prospective housing.
In other words, rent vouchers should not be provided to landlords who are in the process of
evicting a client for back rent, for example. If a month’s worth of rental assistance is
provided to a client, the client should receive a month’s worth of housing.
If a landlord is in the process of evicting a tenant and the tenant is in fact eligible for housing
assistance, prior to issuing the rent voucher to the evicting landlord, it would be in both the
client’s and municipality’s best interest to ensure that the rental payment will stop (or at
least delay for 30 days) the eviction—guaranteeing that the basic necessity of housing will
be provided to the client. In the event the rental payment will not prevent the eviction, the
municipality should direct the client to seek an alternative dwelling, again within their
113
ability to pay. As a side note, court fees involved in preventing an eviction are allowable
expenses under the GA program.
However, municipalities must keep in mind that locating an alternative dwelling may also
result in a need for a security deposit. Although the law states that as a general rule a
security deposit will not be considered a basic necessity and thus municipalities are not
generally responsible for paying them, should the security deposit become required for
“emergency purposes,” the municipality may become responsible for paying it. The term
“emergency purposes” is then defined as “any situation in which no other permanent lodging
is available unless a security deposit is paid.” Thus, this very important factor must be
considered by the GA Administrator prior to directing a client to relocate.
Security Deposits
As a general rule, security deposits will not be considered a basic necessity unless a security
deposit is required for “emergency purposes.” Therefore, the determination as to whether a
security deposit must be paid involves an analysis of whether there is any permanent lodging
(i.e., not hotels, motels or rooming houses) which is available (i.e., vacant and ready for
occupancy) and for which no security deposit is being required. If it can be established that
virtually all permanent and available housing in the area requires a security deposit of some
amount, then the security deposit is a basic necessity and must be included in the applicant’s
budget.
The burden of establishing whether the “emergency purposes” test has been met would
appear to initially fall on the applicant. If the applicant can reasonably satisfy the
administrator that all landlords in the area are requiring a security deposit, the burden would
then fall on the administrator to prove otherwise by directing the applicant to a landlord who
was not requiring a security deposit. For this reason, administrators would be well advised
to keep a running list of area landlords who will readily waive a security deposit.
Under any circumstance, when the municipality does pay a security deposit, the
administrator should make it clear to the landlord (in writing) that the security deposit is to
be returned to the municipality when the apartment is vacated. The administrator may even
want to inspect the property, creating a written inventory of pre-existing defects which is
then signed by the landlord, prior to occupancy in order to rebut any attempt by the landlord
to retain the security deposit after vacancy for reasons of damage allegedly caused by the
tenant.
114
Mortgages
In 1982 the Maine Supreme Court ruled in Beaulieu v. Lewiston 440 A.2d 334 (1982) that
municipalities may be required to pay shelter costs for eligible applicants regardless of
whether that shelter payment is in the form of rent or mortgage. The Beaulieu decision did
not go so far as to say the payment of a mortgage payment was obligatory. Instead, the Court
established a set of eight criteria which should be evaluated by the administrator in order to
determine if the payment of the mortgage is actually necessary.
Those criteria are now part of MMA’s model GA ordinance, and they are discussed in some
detail below. In response to the Beaulieu decision, MMA sought an amendment to the law
and in 1983 the Legislature authorized municipalities to place a lien on a GA recipient’s real
estate if the municipality had paid that recipient’s mortgage with GA funds (§ 4320). In
1991, the Legislature further amended § 4320 to allow municipalities to place the same type
of lien on property when GA is used to pay for a capital improvement to the property (e.g.,
furnace/chimney repair, water/septic system repair).
Liens can be imposed on real estate only if the municipality has granted assistance for a
mortgage payment or capital improvement. No lien can be imposed for granting assistance
for any other basic necessities, such as food, rent, utilities, fuel, etc. Although there are some
restrictions on the lien process, it at least serves the purpose of allowing the municipality to
recover a portion of the equity in the property it has helped a recipient accumulate by either
paying his/her mortgage with GA funds or paying for a capital improvement to his/her
property.
Liens
After the GA administrator makes a mortgage or capital improvement payment, the
municipal officers or their designee (e.g., the GA administrator, treasurer, administrative
assistant—any municipal official specifically designated by the municipal officers for this
purpose) can decide to place a lien on the real estate. Unlike tax liens, however, the lien has
no specific term, and it cannot be claimed or enforced except under very restricted
conditions.
The lien stays in effect against the real estate until it is enforced, but it can be enforced only
when the recipient dies or when the property is transferred by sale or gift. It cannot be
enforced if the recipient is receiving any form of public assistance (TANF, food supplement
benefit, GA, etc.) or if, by redeeming the lien, the recipient would again become eligible for
assistance. These restrictions were imposed on the GA lien process because the purpose of
the lien was not to force GA recipients out of their homes but to enable the municipality to
115
recover the funds it contributed which enhanced the equity in the recipient’s property, while
allowing the recipient to continue to live in the house.
When to Pay
In the Beaulieu case the Supreme Court said that Maine law required municipalities to pay
shelter costs whether the payment was for rent or mortgage. In explaining its decision,
however, the court asserted that municipalities were not required to grant GA for mortgage
payments in every situation, and it outlined eight factors that must be taken into
consideration when determining payment.
In determining whether an applicant is eligible to receive GA for a mortgage payment, as
with any other type of request, the administrator must make an “individual factual
determination” of whether the applicant has an immediate need for such assistance. In
reaching this decision the administrator must consider the extent and liquidity of the
applicant’s proprietary interest in the house. The court said that the factors to be considered
in making this determination include:
1. the marketability of the shelter’s equity;
2. the amount of equity;
3. the availability of the equity interest in the shelter to provide the applicant an opportunity
to secure a short-term loan in order to meet immediate needs;
4. the extent to which liquidation may aid the applicant’s financial rehabilitation;
5. comparison between the amount of mortgage obligations and anticipated rental charges
the applicant would be responsible for if he or she were to be dislocated to rental
housing;
6. the imminence of the applicant’s dislocation from owned housing because of his or her
inability to meet the mortgage payment;
7. the likelihood that the provision of GA for housing assistance will prevent such
dislocation; and
8. the applicant’s age, health and social situation.
All of these factors must be taken into consideration when determining whether to make a
mortgage payment for an applicant. Some municipal officials express outrage that public
116
funds are making it possible for a recipient to live in a home that may be more valuable than
those homes owned by the people who pay the taxes that make GA possible.
Administrators must not let their personal feelings influence their decision. Often the most
compelling reason to make a mortgage payment is that the mortgage may be the least
expensive way for a municipality to fulfill its obligation. In addition, the municipality has
the opportunity to place a lien against the real estate to recover its costs. It is important to
evaluate a request for mortgage payment rationally and determine the most equitable way to
handle the request.
Requests for mortgage payments, as illustrated by the court, do not have to be granted in all
cases; but mortgages should always be considered in the applicant’s budget to determine
eligibility.
The MMA model ordinance suggests that mortgages not be paid unless a mortgage
foreclosure notice has been issued or the failure to make a mortgage payment will
reasonably result in the issuance of a foreclosure notice. At that point there is more of a
likelihood that the applicant is in immediate need.
Once a person receives a foreclosure notice, the administrator should tell the applicant that
he or she should attempt to renegotiate the mortgage or otherwise work out a more favorable
arrangement with the creditor. If the administrator is convinced that the applicant is eligible
for housing assistance in the form of a mortgage payment and no alternatives exist, the
administrator should grant the request.
NOTE: Municipalities may direct GA applicants to obtain other housing (e.g., a rental unit)
should the client be eligible for an amount of GA that will not stop or at least forestall the
foreclosure process (see “Emergencies” near the end of Chapter 2).
Process
As could be expected, there are strict notice requirements the municipality must follow
when placing a GA lien on a recipient’s property. When a person requests GA for a
mortgage payment or capital improvement, the administrator should inform the applicant
that if the request is granted the municipality will place a lien on the property to secure the
municipality’s right to recover both the amount of that payment plus interest.
117
Notices/Lien Forms—Three Types
Once the administrator grants the request for the mortgage or capital improvement payment,
the municipality has 30 days to file a notice of the lien with the county Registry of Deeds. If
the municipal officers have not designated the GA administrator or other person to file lien
notices, they must decide if it is appropriate to place a lien on the property. The notice must
be filed within 30 days of granting the mortgage or capital improvement payment. The steps
to follow in order to file a GA lien are as follows:
First, at least ten days prior to filing the lien notice in the Registry, separate notice must be
sent to the recipient, the owner of the real estate if other than the recipient, and any record
holder of the mortgage. This notice, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, must
inform the recipient that the lien is going to be filed at the Registry. This notice must also
state the restrictions on the lien (i.e., the lien cannot be enforced except upon the recipient’s
death or upon the transfer of the property, and it can’t be enforced while the recipient is
receiving any form of public assistance or if the recipient would in all likelihood again
become eligible for GA if the lien were enforced). Finally, this notice must state the name,
title, address, and telephone number of the person who granted the assistance.
The second lien form is the actual form filed with the Registry of Deeds which establishes
the lien for that first payment and for all subsequent mortgage or capital improvement
payments made on behalf of the recipient each time an additional mortgage or capital
improvement payment is made.
A third notice must be given to the recipient each time an additional mortgage payment is
made. This notice must repeat the information on the original notice, relative to the
limitations and who to contact to answer questions, and it must inform the recipient of the
previous amount secured by the lien and the new total, with the addition of the most current
grant of assistance plus interest. In summary, there are three types of notices:
1. Notice to recipient, owner of the real estate, and any record holder of the mortgage.
This notice must be sent at least ten days before filing the lien at the Registry of Deeds.
This notice must contain the restrictions on the lien and the name, title, address, and
phone number of the person who granted the assistance. This notice must be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, when the lien is first about to be filed.
2. Filing the lien with the Registry of Deeds. This must be filed within 30 days of
actually making the mortgage or capital improvement payment. This notice needs to be
filed only once since this lien secures all subsequent payments.
118
3. Notice each time an additional mortgage or capital improvement is made. This
notice is similar to the first notice above in that it contains essentially the same
information. As a matter of law, this subsequent notice needs to be given to the recipient
only, although MMA recommends issuing this subsequent notice to all the parties to
whom the first “10-day” notice was issued, namely, the recipient, the property owner if
other than the recipient, and the mortgagee. This subsequent notice must state the total
amount secured by the lien with the addition of the most recent mortgage payment and
interest. This notice must also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Sample notice forms for mortgage and capital improvement liens are found in Appendix 8.
Property Taxes
Administrators often ask if property taxes should be considered a “basic necessity” for the
purposes of determining an applicant’s eligibility for GA. The answer is not entirely
straightforward.
Generally, an applicant’s annual property tax, prorated to 30 days, may be included in the
budget as part of the applicant’s overall 30-day shelter cost. This would only be done,
however, if the combination of the applicant’s direct shelter expense (i.e., the mortgage
payment) and the 30-day property tax, when combined, did not exceed the ordinance
maximum for housing.
For example, if Emma Obrien’s property taxes for the year were $800, her 30-day prorated
expense would be $67 ($800/12). If the combination of Emma’s mortgage obligation and
her monthly property tax obligation was less than the ordinance maximum for housing, that
combination total could be included in Emma’s budget when determining her unmet need.
The administrator would not, however, actually pay Emma’s monthly property tax from her
unmet need. The purpose of budgeting in the property tax would be to recognize and, in
effect, subsidize Emma’s monthly property tax obligation. If, on the other hand, Emma’s
mortgage payment already exceeded the ordinance maximum for the direct housing
obligation, Emma’s 30-day property tax obligation would not be included.
An exception to this general process would occur when a household is facing a property tax
emergency. The procedure to follow is described in MMA’s model GA ordinance.
A property tax emergency, according to MMA’s model ordinance, would occur when the
applicant is facing a property tax foreclosure within 60 days, and the tax lien foreclosure
would reasonably result in the applicant’s eviction from the property as a matter of
119
municipal policy or practice. It is only when these standards are met that an administrator
could actually pay a person’s property tax with GA funds.
DHHS regulation also places a limit on the municipal authority to pay an applicant’s
property taxes with GA funds. That state regulation reads:
36 M.R.S.A. § 841 et seq. establishes a poverty tax abatement process. This process
is an available/potential resource. The client has a legal entitlement to this process.
Municipalities should not use the General Assistance Program to assist with
delinquent property taxes unless foreclosure and subsequent eviction is imminent
and it is the most cost effective avenue. (DHHS General Assistance Policy Manual,
Section IV).
In accordance with this regulation, MMA’s model GA ordinance also directs the
administrator to inform all applicants about the poverty abatement process when there is an
application made for emergency GA for their property taxes. If an applicant, when informed
about the poverty abatement process, chooses to apply for an abatement rather than for GA
for property tax relief, that is the applicant’s choice. No one can be forced to apply for one
form of local property tax relief instead of the other.
If the applicant, after being informed of the poverty abatement process, chooses to apply for
GA relief, the administrator would proceed to evaluate the property tax emergency just as
any other request for emergency assistance would be evaluated. If the applicant was eligible
for emergency GA for his or her property taxes in order to protect the applicant’s continued
ownership and use of residential property, the necessary amount of GA could be issued to
the town for that purpose.
See Appendix 9 for MMA Legal Services’ Information Packet on “Poverty Abatements.”
Heating Fuel
Requests for fuel are frequent and often of an emergency nature during the winter. Although
most municipal ordinances specify the maximum allotment for fuel consumption per month
based upon the time of year, this is one basic necessity where maximum levels are often
exceeded. This is due to a number of factors including poorly insulated housing, temperature
fluctuations, fluctuations in the price of heating fuel, etc.
Despite an administrator’s frustration over what may very well be an excessive use of fuel,
by and large the administrator has few choices in the middle of the winter when a family
120
runs out of fuel and has no cash available to purchase more. Certainly the administrator
should advise recipients about conservation measures and should refer them to the proper
agency to apply for weatherization and fuel assistance (see Appendix 11). In addition, the
administrator can review the degree to which the applicant could have financially averted
the heating fuel emergency and limit the issuance of emergency GA for heating fuel
according to the pertinent standards in the municipal ordinance (see “Limitations on
Emergency Assistance,” near the end of Chapter 2).
However, the plain fact is that in most cases the administrator will feel obligated to fulfill
the applicant’s request for actual fuel needed because to go without fuel in the winter could
be life threatening. Administrators should make it clear to recipients, however, that they are
responsible for keeping track of their fuel supply and they should monitor it so they won’t
have to apply for GA when they are totally out of fuel. This benefits both the recipient, who
won’t have to go through a cold night, and the administrator, who won’t have to get a late
night weekend call and won’t have to pay a special delivery service fee to the fuel dealer.
Some municipalities solicit bids from area fuel companies and award the contract to the
dealer who offers the best price and agrees to make deliveries on call and with no service
fee.
Municipalities are sometimes caught in the middle between a tenant who pays for fuel as
part of the rent and a landlord who neglects or refuses to supply adequate fuel. There is a
state law addressing this situation (14 M.R.S.A. § 6021). The statute, known as the “Implied
Warranty and Covenant of Habitability Law,” requires all landlords to keep rental dwelling
units fit for human habitation (i.e., safe and decent; 14 M.R.S.A. § 6021). If there is a
condition which makes the unit unfit, the tenant can file a court complaint against the
landlord and the court can order the landlord to correct any dangerous condition. The law
specifically states that landlords who agree to provide heat as part of the lease or rental
agreement are violating the law if:
? the landlord maintains an indoor temperature which is so low as to be injurious to the
health of occupants not suffering from abnormal medical conditions;
? the dwelling unit’s heating facilities are not capable of maintaining a minimum
temperature of at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit at a distance of three feet from the
exterior wall, five feet above floor level at an outside temperature of minus 20 degrees
Fahrenheit; or
? the heating facilities are not operated so as to protect the building equipment and
system from freezing. 14 M.R.S.A. § 6021(6).
121
If the landlord does not comply with these requirements by allowing a building’s heating
system to run out of fuel, the tenants can, after giving the landlord notice, purchase heating
fuel and deduct the cost of the fuel from the amount of rent they owe. The law goes on to
state: “for tenants on General Assistance, municipalities have the same rights of tenants.”
14 M.R.S.A. § 6026(9). This means that if a tenant applies for GA to receive fuel because
the landlord refuses to provide fuel after being notified by the tenant that fuel is needed and
fuel is part of the rental payment, the municipality can order fuel and deduct the amount of
fuel from the tenant’s next request for rent.
In 1989, the Legislature expanded a tenant’s right to pay for certain services or repairs
directly and deduct those payments from his/her rent. 14 M.R.S.A. § 6024-A allows a tenant
to pay an outstanding utility service to a rented dwelling unit and deduct that payment from
his/her rent. GA administrators should be aware of this provision whenever a tenant in a
utilities-included rental is presented with a utility bill or threatened with disconnection.
For more information regarding “The Rights of Tenants in Maine” refer to Appendix 14,
A Pine Tree Legal Assistance Handbook on the issue of tenant rights.
Example: Grace and Armand LeMont and their four children live in an apartment where
they pay $350 a month, heat included. The landlord is responsible for supplying fuel. The
LeMonts are current in their rent because of the GA they receive to supplement their
income, but the last two weeks of the month they usually run out of oil. This happened last
winter, and it’s starting again this year. Grace spoke to an advocate who advised her to
complain to their landlord in writing. Grace did this but received no response from the
landlord. Sunday, they totally ran out of fuel; Armand called the landlord, who promptly
hung up. Grace applied for and received GA for the fuel. In the written decision, which was
given to both the LeMonts and the landlord, the administrator explained that the fuel was
supplied pursuant to Title 14 M.R.S.A. § 6026(9) and that the rental payment for the
following month would be reduced by the cost of the fuel ($120).
Utilities
In addition to needing utilities for heat, recipients also need electricity or gas for lights,
cooking and refrigeration. The administrator should budget for the actual cost up to the
maximum level established in the ordinance. It is important to know if the ordinance
includes electricity for light, heating, hot water, and cooking in the same or in separate
categories.
122
One of the perennial issues regarding GA for electric utility needs concerns the coordination
between the GA program and the Winter Disconnection Rule, as the “Winter Rule” is
administered by the Public Utilities Commission. There is a discussion of the Winter Rule in
Appendix 11, but in summary, there are two issues associated with Winter Rule/GA
coordination; 1) how should the administrator deal with payment arrangements established
between the customer and the utility company pursuant to the Winter Rule; and 2) how the
administrator should deal with large back bills which sometimes accrue as an inadvertent
result of the Winter Rule.
First, as a matter of GA law, the administrator does not have to take into special
consideration an applicant’s payment arrangement with the utility company. When
determining such an applicant’s eligibility, the administrator would typically budget for
either the applicant’s actual 30-day utility cost or the ordinance maximum for utilities,
whichever is less (see “The Unmet Need Test,” in Chapter 2).
The MMA model GA ordinance, however, allows (but does not require) an administrator to
budget an applicant’s payment arrangement under certain circumstances. The reason this
authority to budget for a payment arrangement was created in the MMA model ordinance is
because in some circumstances customers enter into payment arrangements which provide
for very small payments during the winter season which balloon into proportionally larger
payments during the summer. If the administrator only budgeted for such an applicant’s
actual 30-day cost up to the ordinance maximum, those applicants with these balloon-type
arrangements would not be eligible during the course of a year for the same amount of GA
for utility purposes as an applicant who had no special payment arrangements with the
utility. For further information about the specific conditions governing this authority to
budget for special payment arrangements, consult MMA’s model GA ordinance.
Because the Winter Rule can make it more difficult for utility companies to effectively
collect unpaid bills during the winter season, another side-effect of the Winter Rule is that
some applicants build up large unpaid utility bills which can lead to utility disconnection
when the Winter Rule is lifted in the early Spring, or before the Winter Rule goes into effect
in the late Fall. In the past, municipal administrators have been frustrated by the fact that
some applicants let their utility bills go unpaid all winter and in the spring the municipality
is expected to pay the entire bill. This frustration should be somewhat alleviated by the
municipal authority to limit emergency assistance which is now found at § 4308(2)(B) (see
“Limitations on Emergency Assistance,” near the end of Chapter 2) and which allows
administrators to request from an applicant sufficient documentation to prove that the
applicant could not have financially averted the utility disconnection.
123
Personal & Household Supplies
This category includes items that are needed to maintain the safety and decency of the
household such as cleaning and laundry supplies, paper products, toothpaste, diapers, etc.
These are usually supplied in accordance with the maximum established in the ordinance or
as the administrator believes reasonably necessary.
Clothing
Clothing must be provided as needed. Except in emergencies (fire, flood, etc.) and when
there is an immediate need (such as boots or long underwear in the winter), clothing may be
a postponeable expense but not indefinitely. Before granting clothing assistance, the
administrator should be satisfied that the applicants have attempted in good faith to meet
their needs by shopping at discount stores or clothing thrift shops in the area. Applicants can
be referred to clothing charities in the area for their needs providing they are willing to make
use of charitable services (see “Available Charities,” in Chapter 3).
If the applicants are unwilling to make use of available clothing charities themselves, the
administrator can either obtain the necessary and suitable clothing from a vendor, charitable
or otherwise, and make it available to the applicant, or issue a voucher to any clothing
vendor in an amount sufficient to purchase the necessary clothing items. Some
administrators take it upon themselves to establish clothing drop-off centers or clothing
drives in order to collect clothing which is made available to all applicants as necessary.
Telephone
State law requires municipalities to consider as a necessity basic telephone charges when a
telephone is necessary for medical reasons. Prior to granting this assistance, the
administrator should require that the applicant present a letter from a physician stating that it
is essential that the applicant have telephone service, except that such verification would not
be necessary if the applicant’s medical need for a telephone was obvious. The administrator
should make it clear to the applicant that the municipality will only pay for costs associated
with the basic service and not for unnecessary long distance charges.
Non-Prescription Drugs
In 1989, the Legislature added “non-prescription drugs” to the list of “basic necessities” in
GA law. Most, if not all municipalities provided in their ordinance for such a category of
assistance. This category would include aspirin, cough syrup and any other over-the-counter
medicine, and a maximum amount of assistance available for these items could be
established by ordinance.
124
Medical Services
Certain medical care is a basic necessity that municipalities may be required to pay for from
time to time. Municipalities, however, are not required to pay for medical expenses under all
circumstances. Municipalities are required to grant reasonable requests for medical supplies
such as aspirin, bandages, etc., essential or medically necessary medications prescribed by a
physician, and non-elective medical care. They may also have to pay doctor or hospital
expenses under the following conditions.
Prior Notice
If people need to go to a doctor or hospital and they cannot afford it and want the
municipality to pay for it, they must first give the administrator prior notice. Prior notice is
necessary so the administrator can verify that the medical services are necessary and can
approve the expense. Prior notice also gives the administrator the opportunity to refer the
applicant to a low-cost health care provider if there is one in the area.
The administrator should require the applicant to present a letter from the physician stating
that the service is medically necessary. If the applicant needs to go to a doctor and doesn’t
have a letter, the administrator could consult with the applicant and then call the doctor’s
office to confirm that the applicant has an appointment and that the visit is necessary. If a
person does not give the administrator prior notice, the municipality is not liable for the
expense unless it is an emergency.
Hospital Care
In GA law, the pertinent section dealing with a municipality’s responsibility to pay for
hospital care is found in 22 M.R.S.A. § 4313(1). This section of law describes two
responsibilities of a hospital with regard to the care the hospital must provide to indigent
patients.
? Emergencies. When people need emergency medical attention, obviously they cannot
give the GA administrator notice prior to admission to a hospital. The hospital,
however, is required by state law to notify the municipality of the admission if a patient
is unable to pay the medical bill (or if the patient will not be covered by “Free Hospital
Care”) and the hospital wants the municipality to pay. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4313.
The hospital must notify the administrator within five business days of the patient’s
admittance to the hospital. If the hospital fails to give the municipality proper notification
within the five business days, the municipality has no legal obligation to pay the bill.
125
? Charity Care. The second provision of § § 4313 reads: “In no event may hospital
services to a person who meets the financial eligibility guidelines, adopted pursuant to
section 1716, be billed to the patient or municipality.” The section of Title 22 being
referenced here, § § 1716, establishes a regulatory authority in the Department of
Health and Human Services to adopt income guidelines to be implemented by hospitals
for the provision of health care services to patients determined unable to pay for
services.
These charity care requirements act in conformity with the provisions of the Hill Burton Act
(42 USC § 291 et seq.) implemented by regulation at CFR 42 § 124.506 and more generally
the Public Health Services Act. (42 USC § 201 et seq.). The state regulations of “Hospital
Free Care” guidelines are found in Chapter 150 of the Department of Health and Human
Services – General Rules (10-144).
The current rule revises the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for the
free care policies of hospitals, including minimum income guidelines (based on the Federal
Poverty Guidelines) to be used in determining whether individuals are unable to pay for
hospital services. The patient’s annual income is calculated as either the patient’s income
over the last 12 months or three times the patient’s income over the last four months. The
rule now also sets forth procedures for patients to request a fair hearing if denied free care.
Income eligibility for General Assistance is structured around 100% of HUD Fair Market
Rental values, which yield a GA “standard of need” that runs from 45% to 85% of the
federal poverty level. Therefore, in nearly every case, the GA applicant who would be
eligible for GA is also eligible for “Hospital Free Care.”
In short, the Hospital Free Care regulations and the wording of 22 M.R.S.A. § 4313
generally remove a municipality’s obligation to pay for an applicant’s hospital care. Note
however, that individuals are not usually provided with a filled prescription on their release
from the hospital, which means a municipality may be asked to assist with medication costs.
? this is not to say, however, that a GA application for hospital care assistance should be
automatically denied on the basis of the Hospital Free Care program. Whenever an
applicant does apply for hospital care assistance, the administrator should:
? obtain verification that the applicant has applied for and been denied charity care from
the hospital;
? verify that the hospital care is medically necessary and non-elective;
126
? determine that the applicant does not have sufficient income to work out a payment
arrangement with the hospital for the hospital bill;
? negotiate a discount rate with the hospital, based on the Medicaid rate guidelines, for
any amount of the bill to which the municipality might be exposed; and provide the
necessary financial assistance.
At this point it should be noted that municipalities have the option of paying the hospital
bills in their entirety or spreading the payments out over a reasonable length of time. This is
strictly a policy decision of the municipality. Some hospitals have an early payment
incentive plan which administrators should be aware of.
When reaching its decision the municipality should take into consideration both the financial
and physical condition of the applicant and whether his/her job and income prospects are
good, thereby eventually enabling the applicant to assume financial responsibility for all or
part of the bill. In the alternative, the administrator should determine whether the applicant
has no employment prospects or earning capacity. If the municipality decides to pay the bill
in installments, the applicant must apply regularly and qualify for assistance each month.
Dental & Eye Care
People may apply for GA to enable them to go to the dentist or eye doctor. As with other
medical care, the applicant must give prior notice unless it is an emergency.
Requests for assistance with dental and eye care are generally granted if the service is
essential and there are no other resources available to provide these services (see Appendix
11). Municipalities may receive requests for extensive dental work, dentures, or glasses.
Before granting these requests the administrator should be satisfied that the service is
“medically necessary.” The administrator can request a written statement from the dentist or
eye doctor, or can seek a second opinion—provided that the municipality pays for the
second opinion.
In some areas there are health clinics that offer services at reduced rates, or charitable
organizations that subsidize these services. Both of these resources should be explored prior
to granting a request for these medical services. If none of these resources are available and
the doctor has verified that the services are essential, the municipality must grant the
necessary assistance.
127
Burials & Cremations
Municipalities are responsible for paying the direct burial or cremation expenses, up to the
ordinance maximums, of anyone who dies leaving no money or assets to pay the burial
expenses and who has no liable relatives who are financially able to pay the burial or
cremation costs. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4313. Relatives who are liable for the burial/cremation costs
are parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren. Note that children and
grandchildren are considered liable relatives with respect to burial/cremation expenses only.
There are a number of issues to consider when analyzing the municipal obligation to assist
with the payment for a burial or cremation.
? Burial & Residency. The question often arises as to which municipality is responsible
when assistance is being requested to bury or cremate a person from Town A but the
deceased person’s liable relatives live in Town B, Town C and Town D. The
administrator should remember that the purpose of burial provision of GA law is to
provide the funeral director with necessary financial assistance to bury or cremate an
indigent person when there is no other resource available for that purpose.
To put it another way, the “applicant”—so to speak—for burial assistance is the
deceased person and so it is the deceased’s GA residence at the time of death that
determines which municipality is responsible for burial assistance, not the various
residences of the liable family members. If burial residency was determined by any
other criteria, there would be nothing but confusion as to the issue of responsibility
when a person from one town needed to be buried and the liable relatives were
scattered across the state.
? Burial & Cremation—Funeral Director’s Responsibilities. State law requires the
funeral director to notify the GA administrator prior to burial or cremation or by the
end of three business days following the funeral director’s receipt of the body,
whichever is earlier. Municipalities may choose to institute a written notification
policy—one which would require funeral directors to provide such notice in writing. If
a written notice is required, municipalities can ask for the notification to be sent via fax
in order to expedite matters.
Therefore, when a funeral director is requesting GA to pay for a burial or cremation and the
GA administrator does not receive prior notice and thus has no opportunity to approve the
expenses, the municipality has no legal obligation to pay the bill.
128
The GA administrator should also expect the funeral director to make an effort to identify
the availability of resources to pay for the burial or cremation; including: a description of the
deceased’s estate to the extent it is known; the names and addresses of the legally liable
relatives (grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren of the deceased who live or own
property in Maine); the potential eligibility for burial or cremation benefits such as veterans’
or Social Security burial benefits; and burial contributions offered from any other sources,
such as a local church group or friends of the deceased.
The GA administrator should not expect the funeral director to have all this information at
the time of initial contact. Since the funeral director must make an initial request to the GA
administrator within three business days after receipt of the body, the funeral director has
an interest in contacting the municipality whenever he or she suspects that there will not be
enough money to completely cover burial/cremation costs. From that point on, the GA
administrator and the funeral director should work together to collect and share the
necessary information to calculate eligibility.
Burial & Cremation—Administrator’s Responsibility
When first contacted by the funeral director, the administrator should inform the funeral
director of the maximum amount the municipality can authorize for the burial or cremation
expense. This puts the funeral director on notice that he or she should not expect to be
reimbursed for any amount in excess of the maximum amount allowed in the municipal
ordinance.
The administrator should explain that if the relatives, third parties or other programs (e.g.,
veterans’ or Social Security burial benefits) can pay a portion of the expenses, the
municipality will reduce its obligation and pay the balance up to the amount allowed in the
ordinance.
For instance, if the municipal ordinance allows $1,000 as the maximum amount it will pay,
and the relatives pay $500, the municipality will pay up to the $500 balance even if the
funeral director’s total bill is $1,800. In other words, if the family or others pay any part of
the bill, the municipality will only pay the difference between what the family pays and the
maximum amount allowed in the ordinance for burial/cremation expenses.
In addition, the administrator should explain that after the GA application for a burial is
received, the GA administrator has eight days to reach a decision. This gives the
administrator an opportunity to verify the information and determine if there are any other
assets, resources or relatives who could contribute toward the burial.
129
NOTE: The MMA’s Legal Services Department cautions GA administrators not to sign
documents containing “assumption of risk” clauses for cremations. It was brought to the
attention of Legal Services, that certain “orders for cremation” contained language where by
the municipality was to assume the risk of damage to the crematorium in the event the
deceased had a pacemaker or prosthetic devise. In such cases, the funeral director should
bear the burden of making such a determination prior to cremation—it should not be the
municipality’s responsibility to accept the risk of damage. In the event a cremation
document contains such language, the GA administrator should negotiate that section out of
the document prior to signing any agreement.
Burial & Cremation—Calculation of Eligibility
The municipal obligation to financially assist with the burial or cremation of an indigent
person is the difference between the ordinance maximum for the burial or cremation and the
financial resources that exist for that purpose. Those financial resources are:
? the estate of the deceased;
? the financial capacity of legally liable relatives (grandparents, parents, children,
grandchildren who live or own property in Maine);
? burial benefits such as those sometimes available to veterans and Social Security
recipients with surviving spouses or immediate relatives;
? any actual financial contribution from virtually any other source, such as friends,
community collections, church group donations, etc.
With regard to the deceased person’s estate, Maine’s Probate Code provides sufficient
means for funeral directors to be paid for their services when there is an estate. 18-A
M.R.S.A. § 3-805.
With regard to the financial capacity of legally liable relatives, it should be emphasized that
the test to be applied is one of capacity to contribute financially, not the willingness to do so.
If the administrator is able to identify liable family members who live or own property in
Maine and who have sufficient income to pay for the burial or cremation in lump sum
payment or by any reasonable installment arrangement, the request for burial or cremation
assistance can be denied, even if those liable family members are not willing to contribute.
To determine a relative’s financial capacity to contribute, the relative should be required to
fill out a GA application—not for the purpose of applying themselves for GA, but for the
sole purpose of calculating financial capacity.
130
It is important to remember that municipalities historically have been responsible for
providing a decent burial for people who left no money and had no relatives to pay for their
burial. However, GA is not intended to be a welfare program for liable relatives who could
pay for burial expenses but do not want to, nor is it intended to be a collection agency for
funeral directors who find it easier to bill the municipality.
Finally, a note about the type of burial arrangement is in order. Certainly the burial or
cremation preparations should be carried out with dignity and respect. The wishes of the
family should be fulfilled to the extent possible within the confines of the maximum
assistance allowed in the ordinance.
With regard to the issue of family wishes, at the reasonable request of the Maine Funeral
Directors’ Association, the MMA model GA ordinance provides that the wishes of the
family will be respected as to whether the deceased is buried or cremated. It is only when the
family members concur that a cremation is appropriate or when there are no known family
members that the administrator may elect to issue a benefit for cremation services that are
more cost effective than burial services.
Burials are a very sensitive subject. Relatives applying for GA may be grief stricken and
traumatized. They may want a funeral that entails much more than they or the municipality
can pay. It is incumbent upon the GA administrator to be as sensitive as possible to the
deceased’s relatives, while also fulfilling the law.
131
CHAPTER 8 – Recovery of Expenses
Unlike many other public assistance programs, the GA issued on a recipient’s behalf is
treated more like a loan to the recipient than a no-strings-attached grant. There are five
mechanisms designed into GA law that provide a process of recovery whereby
municipalities can seek to recoup from a recipient part or all of the GA issued. Those five
mechanisms are:
1. a general recovery process (i.e., civil action in small claims court) (§ 4318);
2. a process to recover assistance from a recipient’s legally liable relatives (§ 4319);
3. an authority to place a lien on real property when GA has been used to make a mortgage
payment or capital improvement (§ 4320);
4. an automatic lien on any Workers’ Compensation lump sum payment issued to a
recipient (§ 4318); and
5. a lien on any Supplemental Security Income (SSI) lump sum payment issued to a
recipient (§ 4318).
Each of these recovery processes are briefly described as follows:
The General Recovery Process
Section 4318, in its first paragraph, allows a municipality to recover the amount of
assistance it has granted to a recipient—by civil action if necessary—if and when the
recipient later becomes financially able to repay the municipality. At the time of a person’s
first application for assistance and at the time of every grant of assistance thereafter, the GA
administrator should make the applicant aware of this provision of the law. It is particularly
important to remind applicants of their repayment responsibilities when the administrator
becomes aware that a recipient may soon be returning to work or receiving a large
retroactive lump sum payment, such as a settlement in an accident claim.
When it becomes clear that a recipient’s ability to repay the municipality is a distinct
possibility, the administrator should first seek voluntary reimbursement from the recipient. If
the recipient expresses a willingness to repay the municipality voluntarily, a simple
agreement to that effect can be drawn up, dated and signed by recipient, administrator and
witness. This type of agreement can be written in straightforward language, with flexible
installment payment schedules.
132
Municipalities are cautioned that such agreements should only be entered into after granting
GA and in no event prior to or as a condition to receiving GA. (See Appendix 13 for
sample “Notice of Lien” in anticipation of a disposition of accident/injury claim.)
If the recipient does not wish to sign such an agreement after receiving GA, and at the time
of receiving a lump sum payment or becoming gainfully employed the recipient does not
voluntarily repay the municipality, the town can sue the recipient for recovery. If the amount
to be recovered does not exceed $6,000 (the current maximum amount), the municipality
can take recipients to Small Claims Court (for a filing fee of approximately $50) where it is
not necessary to be represented by an attorney. Because the maximum recovery amount
allowed and filing fees for small claims court change from time to time, checking with the
court to see what the current amounts are is recommended. The Judicial Branch publishes a
very helpful publication called, “A Guide to Small Claims Proceedings in the Maine District
Court” which is available by contacting:
Administrative Office of the Courts
62 Elm St. (2nd Fl.), PO Box 4820
Portland, Maine 04112-4820
Tel. # 822-0792
There are two factors an administrator should bear in mind when seeking recovery. First, the
recipient must be financially able to repay the municipality, which means—in addition to
other reasonable criteria—that the recipient would not become destitute and eligible for GA
as a result of the repayment. The other factor to consider is that 1985 legislation added a
paragraph to § 4318 to expressly prohibit a municipality from recovering any assistance
granted to a workfare recipient as a result of a workfare injury.
Relatives
As § 4318 permits a municipality to seek recovery from a recipient, § 4319 permits a
municipality to seek recovery from—and take to court, if necessary—a recipient’s legally
liable relatives.
As has been noted in an earlier section of this manual, § 4319 of GA law provides that
parents are financially responsible for the support of their children who apply independently
for GA and are under the age of 25. Spouses, by that same section of GA law, are
financially responsible for each other. Under this statute, municipalities may seek recovery
from the financially liable individuals provided the responsible parties either live in Maine
or own property in this state and have a financial capacity to repay the municipality.
133
As a first step in this recovery process, the administrator should attempt to have the liable
relatives voluntarily assume responsibility for providing the basic needs for their children or
spouse (see “Enforcement of Parental Liability,” in Chapter 4). If the parents or spouse are
unwilling to provide direct support, but there is undoubtedly a financial capacity to do so,
the municipality should send a bill to the parents or spouse for the amount of GA granted the
applicant. If that bill is ignored, the municipality could seek recovery from the relatives in
court.
Section 4319 limits a municipality’s ability to recover from liable relatives only the amount
of GA granted to the minor or young adult, or spouse, during the preceding 12 months, so if
the administrator thinks an aggressive collection action is appropriate, the process should be
initiated in a timely manner. Again, before a municipality can pursue any of these steps it
must be sure that the relatives are financially able to provide the support or reimbursement.
Seeking recovery in court from impoverished and therefore judgment-proof people is a
waste of time and money.
In a final note on this issue, GA administrators should exercise good and careful judgment
when considering a collection action against a spouse. It is all too often the case that a
marriage separation that leaves one spouse impoverished and the other with some financial
security is also a separation loaded with personal acrimony that can, in turn, lead to violence
and abuse. If there is some indication that a spouse on the receiving end of a collection
action might respond in an abusive way toward the target of his hostility, the administrator
would be well advised to consider backing away from the collection action. If there are
children involved, the administrator may elect, instead, to advise the individual receiving
GA to contact the Department of Health and Human Services’ Support Enforcement Unit in
an effort to secure any child support obligations from the noncontributing spouse.
Mortgage Payment & Capital Improvement Liens
The third mechanism built into the law by which municipalities can recover some specific
GA expenditures is described in § 4320. Under this section of law, the municipality can file
a lien in the registry of deeds whenever GA is issued on behalf of a recipient towards a
mortgage payment or a capital improvement for the housing in which the recipient is
residing. This lien filing process is described in detail under “Housing,” in Chapter 7.
It should be noted that a GA lien is unlike a municipal tax lien because a GA lien is not a
foreclosing lien. The GA lien enjoys no special priority over any other lien that may have
previously been filed against the property. Because the GA lien is necessarily lower in
134
priority than a mortgage lien, the municipality will very likely lose its GA lien if the
property is foreclosed on by a mortgage holder and conveyed at a mortgage auction.
Other than this circumstance of mortgage foreclosure, the GA lien can be effectively
enforced at the time the property is sold. If a subsequent sale of the property involves bank
financing, the bank’s title search will quickly identify the lien and either the buyer or seller
or both will be obliged to discharge it. If the property is subsequently conveyed without
bank financing, conveyed by a quit claim or “release” deed, or transferred as a gift or part of
an estate, it is possible that no one will voluntarily come forward to discharge the lien. In
that case, the municipality should notify the property owner that the town will be enforcing
its lien pursuant to § 4320. If necessary, the town may have to take the new property owner
to court to enforce its lien.
Workers’ Compensation Lump Sum Liens
In December 1991, § § 4318 was amended to give municipalities a statutory lien on
Workers’ Compensation lump sum benefits for the amount of GA issued by the municipality
to the person subsequently receiving the Workers’ Compensation lump sum payment. The
language of § 4318 creates the lien automatically: that is, there are no particular notice or
paperwork requirements necessary to perfect the lien.
On the other hand, if the GA recipient’s employer or the employer’s insurance company
does not know about the municipal lien, they will not be sufficiently aware to segregate out
the municipal share of any lump sum payment issued to a Workers’ Compensation
beneficiary. Therefore, it is for the purpose of actually collecting on the lien, rather than
establishing or perfecting the lien, that the following paperwork requirements are
recommended.
? Definition of “lump sum payment.” For obvious reasons the new language in § 4318
establishes a lien against Workers’ Compensation lump sum benefits, not the regular,
weekly Workers’ Compensation benefits that a recipient might be receiving. To enforce
a lien against weekly benefits would merely create a proportionately greater need for
weekly GA.
That being said, there remains some confusion over the issue of exactly what is a Workers’
Compensation “lump sum payment.” The reason for this confusion is that General
Assistance law, in 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(8-A) has one definition of “lump sum payment,” and
Workers’ Compensation law, in 39-A M.R.S.A. § 352, defines and deals with its own
version of “lump sum payments.”
135
The Title 39-A definition would seem to limit the consideration of lump sum payments to
lump sum settlements; that is, the commutation of all future weekly benefits to a lump sum.
This commutation is potentially available to any ongoing recipient of Workers’
Compensation benefits. The definition of “lump sum payment” in GA law is more
generalized, and expressly includes “retroactive or settlement portions of workers’
compensation payments…”
A retroactive payment would include a larger-than-weekly Workers’ Compensation payment
a recipient might receive if there was some delay in processing his or her claim, whether in
contested or uncontested cases. In short, it would appear that the way § 4318 is now worded,
in light of the § 4301(8-A) definition of “lump sum payment,” the municipal lien is to be
applied and may be enforced against either Workers’ Compensation lump sum settlements
or retroactive Workers’ Compensation lump sum payments of any other kind.
? Paperwork requirements—the UCC-1 Form. The Workers’ Compensation liens
should be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State, Uniform Commercial Code
division, on a UCC-1 form (see Appendix 17 for sample “UCC-1 form”).
? How to fill in the form. The form instructions ask that the form be typed.
1. In Boxes #1 & 2—labeled “Debtor,” the administrator should enter the name of
the General Assistance recipient, using Box 2 if there is an additional recipient.
2. In Box #3—labeled “Secured Party,” the administrator should enter the name of
the municipality, the name of the General Assistance administrator, and the
municipality’s mailing address.
3. In Box #4—labeled “Collateral,” indicate the collateral covered by the statement.
Since there is no way to know the precise amount of General Assistance that will
be recoverable at the time the Workers’ Compensation lump sum payment is
issued, the administrator should enter into this box the following:
“Any and all lump sum payment of Workers’ Compensation benefits, up to
the value of general assistance granted from secured party to debtor from
January 1, 1992 forward, including future advances of general assistance to
debtor.”
4. The administrator should leave blank the Box labeled “Alternative Designation”
This would only apply should the town ever wish to sell these liens.
136
5. The administrator should also leave blank the small check-boxes regarding
covered collateral.
6. The line labeled “Optional Filer Reference Data” should be left blank.
Where should this form be filed?
The form must be filed with the:
Secretary of State’s Office
Uniform Commercial Code Division
State House Station #101, Augusta, Maine 04333
Tel. # (207) 624-7736
There is a $15 filing fee, unless you have attachments creating more than 2 pages, then the
filing fee is $30. The lien is established for a period of five years. For continuing the lien, a
Continuation of Lien form must be filed six months before the five-year period elapses. This
means that a “tickler file” should be established for all filed liens so that somewhere around
four and one-half years after any lien is filed, the appropriate official will know to file the
continuation form.
Finally, after the UCC-1 form is completely filled out, a few photocopies should be made so
that one photocopy can be sent to the “obligor” (the applicable compensation insurance
company), and one to the recipient’s Compensation attorney. It is particularly important to
put the employer’s insurance company and the injured employee’s Compensation attorney,
if any, on the notice with regard to the municipal lien. For that reason, it is advisable to send
them a photocopy of this UCC-1 form by certified mail, return receipt requested.
? When should the UCC-1 form be filed? At $15 a filing, the administrator will not
want to file these liens against all clients on the off chance that a few of them, someday,
may receive a lump sum Workers’ Compensation benefit. The administrator will
probably want to file these liens only when the recipient (a) is receiving Workers’
Compensation already or (b) has applied for Workers’ Compensation after sustaining a
work-related injury.
The way the law is worded, however, it would appear that the municipality can recover any
and all GA issued to a recipient after the effective date of the new law (December 23, 1991),
even though some of that GA may have been issued before the recipient sustained a workrelated
injury. In this respect the Workers’ Compensation lien should be distinguished from
the lien on retroactive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits (discussed below). The
SSI lien is expressly intended to capture only the interim GA issued to a person during the
time between that person’s first SSI application and any subsequent retroactive benefit.
137
What this lien does not and cannot capture is GA issued prior to the effective date of this
enabling legislation. Therefore, no GA issued prior to December 23, 1991 can be recovered
by this lien. In an effort to reduce confusion, MMA’s suggested language on the UCC-1
form starts the window of recovery on January 1, 1992.
? Monitoring the lien. After the UCC-1 form has been filed, the administrator’s only
task will be to keep track of how much GA is issued to the recipient. The way this
process is supposed to work, when the employer or the employer’s insurance company
is getting ready to cut a lump sum check to the recipient, the administrator should be
contacted and asked for the precise amount captured by the municipal lien. For this
reason, again, a special “tickler file” should be kept on all cases covered by these liens.
Offsetting “Workfare” Performed
In April of 1998, the Maine Supreme Court rendered a decision in Coker v. City of Lewiston,
1998 Me. 93, which reversed previous statutory interpretation, DHHS policy and municipal
practice with respect to lump sum Workers’ Compensation awards and municipal GA liens
relative to workfare performed. Whereas workfare was formerly deemed solely a condition
of eligibility for prospective general assistance, the Coker decision characterized workfare
as discharging the recipient’s municipal reimbursement obligation to the extent of the value
of workfare performed (calculated at a rate of at least minimum wage). Later that year,
Thompson, et al., v. Commissioner, Department of Health and Human Services and City of
Lewiston (CV-94-509, Me. Super. Ct., Ken., August 28, 1998), another case on point, was
decided, albeit at the Superior Court level, which applied the Coker analysis to the SSI
Interim Assistance Program. As a result, DHHS policy was amended to provide that all
workfare performed must be “backed out” or subtracted from the recipient’s municipal
obligation.
Liens on SSI Lump Sum Retroactive Payments
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal entitlement cash benefit that is issued
monthly to people who are unable to be employed for extended periods of time for reason of
physical or mental disability. For more information about the SSI program, see Appendix
11.
It is not unusual for a person applying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to be denied
benefits initially, only to be granted benefits after a lengthy appeal process. When this
occurs, the SSI recipient is issued a retroactive benefit covering a period of time going back
to the point in time on or after the date of initial SSI application when the applicant is
determined to be disabled. Those retroactive benefits can be for many thousands of dollars.
138
Federal law, in a general way, prohibits the recovery by legal process of any benefits
received by a Social Security recipient unless that recovery or repayment is voluntarily
allowed by the recipient. 42 USC § § 407. Another more specific section of federal law,
however, allows state governments to establish systems whereby the state government and
political subdivisions of the state can be reimbursed for interim public assistance payments
the state or municipalities must make while individuals are waiting for the SSI applications
to be processed. 42 USC § 1383(g). In two steps, the Maine Legislature authorized DHHS to
establish just such a system of interim assistance reimbursement.
The municipality and the state will be reimbursed automatically for the GA issued to a
person while that recipient is waiting for an SSI eligibility determination and subsequently
receives a retroactive lump sum SSI payment. To obtain this reimbursement, the
municipality must first get the GA applicant to sign the reimbursement agreement. Because
federal law gives sole authority to establish this reimbursement system with the state, a
municipality may not establish a mandatory reimbursement agreement by its own authority,
and even an agreement form to be signed by the GA recipient must be the form provided to
the municipality by DHHS. Any applicant who does not wish to sign the agreement will not
be eligible for GA.
The Interim Assistance Agreement forms to be used in this process are only available from
the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to the actual agreement forms,
DHHS will provide any municipality requesting the forms with a “Vendor Identification
Form” and an instructional memo describing how the two forms are to be filled out and
maintained.
The “Vendor Identification Form” provides the Department with the necessary information
to cut the remainder check to the SSI recipient and mail the remainder check out after the
value of the GA is removed from the initial SSI retroactive check. To obtain copies of these
forms and the instructional memo, either write to the Department of Health and Human
Services, General Assistance Unit, State House Station #11, 19 Union Street, Augusta,
Maine 04333 or call the Department’s toll-free number (1-800-442-6003). (Also, see
Appendix 18.)
After the recipient has signed the agreement form, the administrator should retain one copy,
provide a copy to the recipient, and send a copy to the Department along with the Vendor
Identification Form. After that point in time, any retroactive SSI payment will go directly
from the Social Security Administration to DHHS, where the municipal/state share will be
139
diverted, with the remainder of the retroactive lump sum payment being passed through to
the SSI recipient.
DHHS will have a limited period of time (ten days) to pass through the SSI retroactive
benefit to the recipient after subtracting the municipal/state share. Therefore, as is the case
with Workers’ Compensation lien case records, the administrator should keep a tickler file
on all clients who have signed the SSI reimbursement agreement so that the municipality
can quickly tally the total GA captured by the SSI lien when DHHS needs that information.
The Department now has model forms for the purpose of keeping track of GA benefits
issued to pending SSI recipients.

141
CHAPTER 9 – Written Decision
Once the administrator has received and verified all the necessary information and has
determined whether the applicant is eligible, the next step is to give a written notice of
decision to the applicant. The administrator must give a written decision to applicants each
time they apply, whether or not assistance is granted or denied, within 24 hours of receiving
a completed application.
It is absolutely essential that the administrator give the applicant a written decision within
24 hours of receiving each application, after deciding to reduce, suspend, terminate or make
any change in an applicant’s grant of assistance. Furthermore, if a person is denied
assistance, the decision must state the specific reasons for the denial. Simply stating, “The
applicant is denied because he is ineligible” is not sufficient notice.
Even when a person is granted assistance and receives a voucher for food or rent and is fully
informed of the nature of the grant, the administrator must give written notice stating the
specific reasons for the decision, and noting the type and amount of aid granted.
The purpose of the decision is to inform the applicants what assistance they were or were
not granted and to inform them that they have the right to question that decision by
appealing it to the Fair Hearing Authority. In addition to giving a written decision within
24 hours, assistance—if granted—must also be furnished within the same 24-hour period.
In emergencies, assistance must be provided as soon as possible within this period.
Contents
There are six important elements in the notice of decision:
1. the reasons for the decision;
2. the amount of assistance granted or denied;
3. the specific period of eligibility (e.g., from Jan. 6, 2014 to Jan. 20, 2014);
4. the conditions, if any, that are being placed on the grant of assistance that may affect
future eligibility;
5. the right to complain to the Department of Health and Human Services if the applicant
believes the municipality has violated state law; and
6. the right to question or appeal the decision to a Fair Hearing Authority.
142
Reasons
The written decision must state whether the request for assistance has been granted or
denied and give the reasons for the decision. The reason must be specific. For example,
stating, “The applicant is granted assistance in accordance with section 6.9 of the
ordinance,” does not fulfill the spirit of the intent of giving a written notice. The purpose of
the decision is to provide the applicant with sufficient information about what action was
taken on the request for assistance and why.
The decision should explain the Town’s action completely, such as:
“The applicant is found eligible to receive assistance because the household income
is less than the allowed expenses and therefore the household is in need, in
accordance with section 5.1 of the municipal ordinance, and the applicant has
completed the work requirement, pursuant to section 5.5 of the ordinance.”
or,
“The applicant is denied due to sufficient household income to meet his need for
basic necessities pursuant to sections 4.5 and 6.7 of the municipal ordinance and
state law. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4309.”
? Amount of assistance. The decision should state the amount of GA that was requested
and state what assistance was actually granted or denied. For instance, an applicant
might request $350 for rent. If the applicant was granted $300 because that is the
maximum amount allowed, the decision should reflect why the total request was not
granted.
? Period of eligibility. It is very important that every decision clearly indicates the period
of eligibility for which the GA grant is being made. The period of eligibility, by law,
can be for no longer than 30 days, but it may be for any period shorter than 30 days.
One reason for clearly indicating the period of eligibility is to make sure the applicant is
aware of the duration of the grant and, therefore, when he or she should reapply. Another
reason for noting the period of eligibility is to keep track of the amount of assistance granted
during a specific period of time so that the point at which “emergency” assistance (i.e.,
assistance granted over and above the household’s deficit) must be granted can be easily
established.
143
? Conditions of future eligibility. The purpose behind the two-step GA application
process which generally provides a “need only” test of eligibility for first time
applicants, and allows the imposition of other eligibility conditions (such as the work
requirement) for future applications, is to give people the “benefit of doubt” the first
time they apply but to expect them to know the eligibility requirements for subsequent
applications.
The only way this process will work is if recipients know what those eligibility requirements
are. Therefore it is essential that the decision inform recipients what they will have to do to
receive assistance upon subsequent applications. MMA provides a brochure that explains
applicants’ rights and responsibilities.
Able-bodied, non-working recipients must be told that they must:
? register for work with the Maine Job Service;
? look for work;
? accept a job offer;
? not quit work, if and when employed, and not be discharged from employment for
misconduct.
In addition, the decision should inform recipients that they must apply for any resource that
would assist them, and specify what those resources are (food supplement benefit, TANF,
fuel assistance, unemployment compensation, etc.). They should be instructed to seek
assistance from legally liable relatives (parents, spouses) and should be informed that those
liable relatives may be billed for any assistance granted to the applicants.
If recipients have any assets the administrator expects them to sell or use as collateral, this
also must be included in the decision, along with the reasonable time frame in which to
liquidate the asset or apply for a loan against significant collateral.
All applicants should be informed of the lump sum proration process and what their specific
responsibilities will be if they receive a lump sum payment. (see “Lump Sum Income,” in
Chapter 2).
The applicants should be told that any income they receive must be used for basic
necessities and if it is not it may result in the household being ineligible or receiving a
144
reduced amount of assistance. Further, the recipient should be reminded about the penalties
for committing fraud in Chapter 3.
In short, the decision should state any and all conditions the administrator expects the
recipient to fulfill. If the recipient doesn’t know that she could apply for fuel assistance or
that she was expected to sell her wood lot, she won’t do it and can’t be disqualified for not
complying with directions to use available resources.
Finally, the written decision should also include any use-of-income guidelines the
administrator thinks appropriate to impose in accordance with the use-of-income policy
adopted by the town (see “Use-of-Income Guidelines,” in Chapter 2).
These guidelines may consist of a preprinted notice that explains how recipients are
expected to spend their income, or the use-of-income requirements may be specifically
stated on the decision issued to the recipient, or both. For example, the notice issued to all
applicants may generally explain that the municipality considers any rent or mortgage
obligation to be the recipient’s responsibility. In addition, on a particular recipient’s decision
form the administrator might write, “You are also expected to apply $250 of the TANF
check you will be receiving next week toward your rent, and the next time you apply you
must bring a rent receipt showing that this was done.”
Administrators should remember that any generally applicable use-of-income policy adopted
by the municipality must be issued to all applicants.
? Right to complain to DHHS. The decision must give notice that people have the right
to complain about the decision to the Department of Health and Human Services if they
believe the municipality has violated state law. DHHS has a toll-free telephone number
for this purpose and that number must be on the decision (1-800-442-6003). A law
enacted in 1990 also requires that this telephone number be posted.
? Right to appeal. The decision must inform people that they have the right to challenge
the decision at a fair hearing and inform them of the process for obtaining a fair hearing
(see “Fair Hearings,” Chapter 10).
It is important that all this information be included in the written decision. It is also
important that the administrator take the time to explain to the applicant the eligibility
requirements and the right to appeal the decision.
145
Summary
Applicants must be given a written decision each time they apply. The decision must be
given within 24 hours of receiving an application. It must be given whether assistance is
granted or denied and it must state the reasons for the decision. If assistance is granted it
must be furnished within the 24 hour period. The decision must inform the applicants that if
dissatisfied they may appeal the decision to a Fair Hearing Authority, and if they believe
that the administrator violated state law they can complain to the Department of Health and
Human Services. The decision must also explain what conditions must be met to receive
assistance in the future.

147
CHAPTER 10 – Fair Hearings
People who disagree with the GA administrator’s decision, act, failure to act, or delay,
concerning their request for general assistance have the right to appeal the action to a Fair
Hearing Authority (FHA). In order to utilize that right, however, applicants must act in a
timely manner.
They must request a fair hearing in writing within five working days of receiving a written
notice of denial, reduction, or termination of assistance, or within ten working days of any
other act or failure to act by the administrator. If the time period elapses and the applicant
hasn’t requested a fair hearing, he/she loses the chance to appeal that decision. The person’s
only recourse is to reapply for assistance.
For instance, Judy Cutler applied for GA. She was denied in writing because she had not
fulfilled her workfare assignment and was therefore disqualified. She requested a hearing
two weeks after receiving the decision. Her right to request a hearing lapsed because she had
received a written notice and the five working days she had to request an appeal had passed.
The administrator told her he could not schedule a hearing but he could take another
application from her.
Keep in mind that the administrator cannot terminate or reduce an applicant’s grant of
assistance once the grant has been made prior to the applicant being allowed to appeal the
decision.
For example, Eldon Cote was granted assistance. Two weeks later the administrator found
out that Eldon had been working but had not reported it. The administrator notified Eldon
that he had been granted more GA than he was entitled to receive, that he must repay $100
for the assistance he received and that he would be ineligible to receive GA for 120 days (as
of the date the fraud was discovered) because of the fraud. The notice also informed Eldon
that he had the right to appeal the decision. Eldon did not appeal instead he made
arrangements to repay the assistance he had not been eligible to receive.
The administrator should provide a form for people to request a fair hearing. The form
should state the person’s name and address, why he or she wants a fair hearing, and what
assistance the applicant believes himself or herself to be entitled to. The administrator
should never try to dissuade an applicant from requesting a fair hearing. Certainly the
administrator can discuss any questions the person has, but if the applicant insists on having
a hearing, the administrator must schedule one.

When to Hold a Hearing
The administrator must schedule a fair hearing and it must be held within five working days
of when the administrator receives a written request from a dissatisfied applicant. In
scheduling the hearing, the administrator should attempt to hold it at a time that is mutually
convenient for the Fair Hearing Authority and the applicant. If the applicant wants an
extension of time because there hasn’t been time to prepare the case or due to other good
cause, he or she can ask the administrator to exceed the five working days. If the
administrator does schedule the hearing after the statutory time period, the administrator
should have the applicant make a written request explaining why he/she needs the extension.
After people (claimants) request a hearing they must be given written notice of when and
where the hearing will take place. Claimants should be informed that they have the right to
present witnesses and evidence on their behalf, question witnesses against them, and be
represented by legal counsel or other representatives.
Unlike most municipal proceedings, the fair hearing is closed to the public; it can only be
open to the public at the claimant’s request. Therefore anyone who does not have any
official role in the hearing is not allowed to attend. The Fair Hearing Authority, the
claimant, his/her legal representative and witnesses, the GA administrator and the Town’s
attorney and witnesses, and a person to record the hearing are the only people who should be
present. The claimant can bring family members or friends for support. Selectpersons,
councilors or other municipal employees who are not overseers or who did not have any role
in the decision or who are not Fair Hearing Authority members are not allowed to attend
unless they are witnesses.
Fair Hearing Authority
The Fair Hearing Authority can be one or more municipal officers; the board of appeals, if
specifically delegated the responsibility; or one or more persons appointed by the municipal
officers to act as the Fair Hearing Authority. In no case may the Fair Hearing Authority
include any person who was responsible in any way for the decision, act, failure to act, or
delay in action relating to the claimant.
Conduct of the Fair Hearing—Decision
The hearing is informal in that it is not necessary to adhere strictly to the rules of evidence
required by a court of law. However, the FHA should keep uppermost in its thoughts that the
purpose of the hearing is to hear both sides in the case, evaluate all the facts objectively, and
reach a decision based solely on the information presented at the hearing, pursuant to the
requirements of state law and municipal ordinance.
The FHA must give the claimant a written decision within five working days after the
hearing. The FHA must state specific reasons for its decision and specify what section(s) of
149
state or municipal law it used in making its decision. If the claimant is aggrieved by the Fair
Hearing Authority’s decision, he or she has the right to appeal the decision to the Superior
Court within 30 days. The right to appeal the decision must be explained to the claimant in
the written decision. From the Superior Court decision, there is an appeal route to the Maine
Supreme Court.
Record
The municipality must make a taped record of the fair hearing. Claimants are responsible for
the costs of providing a transcript if they decide to appeal the Fair Hearing Authority’s
decision to Superior Court.
The Department of Health and Human Services
Role
In 1983 when the Legislature enacted a major revision of the GA law it also increased the
role of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in the administration of GA.
It expanded the state’s involvement from merely monitoring all GA programs to supervising
GA. The Legislature also gave DHHS the authority to grant assistance directly to applicants
in emergencies if the applicants were denied assistance due to a municipality’s “failure to
comply” with GA law. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4323.
Prior to 1983 the law stated:
“The department shall offer assistance to municipalities in complying with this
chapter. The department may review the administration of the general assistance
program of any municipality whether or not reimbursement is given. This review
shall include a discussion with and, if necessary, recommendations to the
administrator of the general assistance program as to the requirements of this
chapter.”
In practice, the DHHS reviewed the GA programs in only those municipalities which
received state reimbursement. Since less than 25% of the state’s nearly 500 municipalities
received any state reimbursement, the DHHS did not have a very visible role in GA. And
although the state Attorney General was empowered to prosecute any municipality that
administered its GA program contrary to state law, this power was rarely invoked. The
DHHS role has changed now that all municipalities are eligible to receive at least 50% state
reimbursement for GA expenditures (see “Reimbursement,” in Chapter 10). (Refer to
Appendix 18 for information on the DHHS “Review Process for General Assistance” in
addition to relevant DHHS forms).
150
Review
The state’s laissez-faire attitude changed drastically in 1983 when the Legislature mandated
that the DHHS be responsible for the proper administration of GA and assist municipalities
in complying with the state law (§ 4323). In 1993, the DHHS role was slightly relaxed with
a removal of a DHHS obligation to review all municipal ordinances for legal compliance. At
the present time, GA law instructs DHHS to review each municipality’s GA program
(known as an “audit”). This requires DHHS to visit each municipality regularly, as well as in
response to requests or complaints, and to inspect the GA records to determine if the
program is administered according to the law. The DHHS representative must discuss the
results of the review with the administrator and report his or her findings in writing to the
municipality. The written notice must inform the municipality if the program is in
compliance or, if it is not, how to comply. The administrator or his or her designee must be
available during the department’s review and cooperate in providing necessary information.
It is important that someone (preferably the administrator) be there in order to answer any
questions which may arise during the course of the DHHS audit.
Violations
If, after conducting a review, DHHS determines that a municipality’s GA program is being
administered improperly, it must notify the municipality. The written notice will alert the
municipality of the violations and how to correct them. The municipality has 30 days to
correct the violations and file a plan with DHHS describing what steps it will take to comply
with the law. The DHHS will notify the municipality if the plan of correction is acceptable
and that it will review the municipality’s program again within 60 days of accepting the
plan.
Penalty
If a municipality doesn’t file an acceptable plan or if it continues to operate its GA program
in violation of state law, the state can stop reimbursing the municipality for its GA expenses
until it does comply. Further, the municipality can be fined by a court of law not less than
$500 a month for each month it continues to administer its GA program improperly.
22 M.R.S.A. § 4323(2).
Complaints & Direct Assistance
In addition to the annual or regular program reviews by DHHS, the Department also fields
any complaints from GA applicants who feel the municipality did not respond to the
applicant’s request for GA in accordance with state law. For that purpose, DHHS has a tollfree
complaint “hot line” (1-800-442-6003). This “hot line” telephone number has to be
posted on the notice of the municipality’s General Assistance Program and included as a
part of all written decisions applicants are given. Typically, the DHHS personnel on the “hot
151
line” will take the complaint over the phone and attempt to discern whether the municipal
administrator responded to the application correctly. This sometimes requires calls back and
forth between the DHHS and the town, DHHS and the applicant, DHHS and the town, and
so forth, as the Department attempts to get all sides to the story. Almost all complaints are
resolved in this manner, but the Department has the authority to intervene when it appears to
DHHS that the applicant did not receive a proper decision from the town and the applicant is
in immediate need.
The law governing the state’s right to intervene in a GA decision is found in § 4323(3).
There it is found that under certain circumstances the state does not have to withhold
reimbursement, conduct an in-depth review or impose a fine in order to rectify a problem. In
some cases DHHS can act immediately and grant assistance to applicants. The DHHS is
empowered to grant assistance directly to applicants who need assistance immediately
(i.e., emergency GA) if the applicant has not received assistance as a result of the
municipality’s failure to comply with the requirements of the state’s GA law.
If DHHS grants assistance directly, the municipality will be billed not only for the assistance
but also for the state’s administrative costs connected with that grant of assistance. No
municipality, however, may be held responsible for reimbursing the DHHS if the
Department failed to intervene within 24 hours of receiving the request to intervene or if the
DHHS failed to make a good faith effort to notify the municipality of the DHHS action prior
to the intervention.
If the DHHS does intervene in a timely manner and with prior notice and the municipality is
billed and fails to pay the bill within 30 days, DHHS is authorized to recover its money by
simply withholding that amount from a future reimbursement due the municipality. If that
wasn’t practical for some reason, DHHS could forward the bill to the State Treasurer for
payment. The Treasurer would then reduce the town’s State Municipal Revenue Sharing,
education subsidy, or other funds owed to the municipality.
The law governing DHHS intervention requires the department to make a “good faith” effort
to contact the GA administrator to verify complaints it receives prior to granting assistance
directly. If DHHS cannot reach the administrator or if DHHS cannot resolve the complaint
with the municipality and if it is satisfied that an emergency exists, DHHS will grant
assistance directly to the applicant. In effect, this section of the state law provides for a
limited state “take-over” of the GA program.
Maximum Levels of Assistance
There is one other specific type of complaint that the Department is authorized to
investigate, and that is the specific maximum levels of assistance for the various basic needs
152
as developed by municipalities as part of their ordinance. Although the DHHS obligation to
review all municipal ordinances for legal compliance was removed as of July 1, 1993,
a DHHS authority to review, upon complaint, the specific maximum levels of assistance was
retained.
Written Notice
Whenever complaints are made against a municipality, the DHHS must give written notice
to the person making the complaint and the municipality explaining why it did or did not
intervene in the case.
Appeals
If a person making a complaint or a municipality disagrees with the DHHS decision
regarding a request to intervene, either party can appeal the decision to a state hearing
officer. If a municipality wishes to request a hearing it must request the hearing in writing
within 30 days of being notified that the DHHS has granted direct assistance. An impartial
person must hold this hearing. If the municipality disagrees with the hearing officer’s
decision, it can appeal the decision to the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 80C of the Maine
Rules of Civil Procedure. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4323(4).
Just because DHHS threatens to intervene or actually intervenes, that doesn’t mean that the
DHHS is correct and is exercising its authority properly. The state, just as municipalities,
can make mistakes. If a municipality is contacted by the DHHS and is told to grant
assistance or be billed for it, the municipality should reevaluate the case. If it is an
emergency (a life threatening situation or a situation beyond the control of the individual
which if not alleviated immediately could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the
health or safety of the individual), the municipality would be responsible for providing
assistance if the applicant were eligible.
However, usually DHHS only hears one side of the story—either from the dissatisfied
applicant or the applicant’s legal representative. The GA administrator often has a better
idea of the true situation than DHHS(if for no other reason than because he or she is on the
scene and knows if there really is an emergency and there are no alternatives). If the DHHS
grants assistance directly to a person despite the municipality’s objections, the municipality
should contact MMA or the municipal attorney to discuss the merits of the case and decide
whether it would be worthwhile to appeal the decision.
DHHS Rules
The DHHS has promulgated rules which outline its procedures for fulfilling its
responsibilities. These rules are known as the Maine General Assistance Policy Manual, and
153
may be obtained from the DHHS, General Assistance Unit, State House Station #11,
Augusta, Maine 04333. (Once obtained, municipalities should place the rules after tab 15 of
this manual.)
Reimbursement
The details of the system of state reimbursement for a portion of the GA benefits that are
issued are described more fully below, but it should be noted at the outset that the GA
reimbursement formula underwent a dramatic change in 1993. For ten years the
reimbursement formula was based on a municipal “obligation” level that was a fixed .0003
times the municipality’s 1981 state valuation. As of July 1, 1993, the municipal “obligation”
was modified to become .0003 times the municipality’s most recent state valuation. The
concept of the municipal “obligation” and the manner in which the municipal “obligation”
affects a particular municipality’s reimbursement is described in more detail below, but the
general impact of this change in the law is to significantly increase many municipalities’
financial exposure to the GA program by reducing the amount of state reimbursement that
was formerly provided some of the towns and cities in Maine that are experiencing the
greatest demand for GA.
GA law requires the state to reimburse municipalities for a portion of their GA expenses.
The amount of reimbursement is based on two formulas found in § 4311, as those formulas
are applied to the municipality’s “net general assistance cost.” The “net” GA cost is defined
in § 4301(11) as the direct costs of assistance not including associated administrative costs.
There is room for confusion on this issue because one of the reimbursement formulas is
called “reimbursement for administrative expenses.” Despite that title, the state does not
reimburse municipalities for administrative costs.
The first reimbursement formula applies to every municipality whose net GA costs in a
given fiscal year (from July 1 through June 30) exceed .0003 of the municipality’s most
recent state valuation. That figure—.0003 of the municipality’s most recent state
valuation—is called the municipality’s “obligation.” When the “obligation” is exceeded, the
state reimburses 90% of the municipality’s net expenses over that level. For instance, if
.0003 of Lewiston’s 2014 state valuation is $586,925, once Lewiston issues $586,925 in
GA during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, it is eligible to be reimbursed 90% for any
GA expenditures over that amount.
The second reimbursement formula became effective on July 1, 1989 and applies to every
municipality in addition to the 90% formula. The second formula is either 50% of all net
GA below the municipal obligation or 10% of the entire net GA cost. For any given (state)
fiscal year, municipalities are free to choose which version of the second reimbursement
formula they wish the DHHS to apply. For almost all municipalities, 50% of the under154
obligation figure is greater than 10% of the net GA figure, and the 50% formula would be
the most advantageous (second example below). For a few municipalities, however, 10% of
their entire GA expenditure is greater than 50% of their obligation, and those municipalities
would choose the 10% formula (first example below). As discussed above, regardless of
which “administrative” reimbursement formula is used, the 90% over-obligation formula
still applies.
Example: For FY 2014, let us assume the town of Mars Hill will issue $60,000 in net GA.
Mars Hill’s 2014 state valuation is $37,000,000, so the town’s obligation level is $11,100.
Therefore, Mars Hill will be eligible for 90% of its spending over $11,100, or $44,010 [90%
of ($60,000 - $11,110)]. In addition, Mars Hill could either receive 50% of its obligation, or
$5,550 or 10% of its net GA spending of $60,000, or $6,000. In this case, the 10% option
would be in Mars Hill’s best interest. A short-cut method to determine if your municipality
should opt for the 10%-of-net formula is to evaluate if your GA expenditure is at or above
5x (times) your obligation. If so, the 10%-of-net formula will provide more reimbursement
than the 50%-of-obligation formula.
Example: Assume, for the purpose of this example, that the Town of Anson issues $65,000
in GA during FY 2014. The town’s obligation level is .0003 times the most recent state
valuation of $80,650,000, or $24,195. Anson will be eligible to receive, therefore, 90% of its
“over-obligation” spending, or $40,805 [90% of ($65,000 - $24,195)]. In addition, Anson is
eligible to receive either 50% of its obligation ($12,097.50) or 10% of the entire net
expenditure ($6,500). It is to Anson’s advantage, obviously, to choose the 50%-of-obligation
reimbursement.
Example: Based on historical spending levels, the Town of Mt. Vernon will probably issue
about $10,000 in GA during FY 2014. The town’s obligation (.0003 times the most recent
state valuation) is $27,300. Mt. Vernon, therefore, will not be eligible for any 90%
reimbursement. Because Mt. Vernon’s spending will not come close to exceeding its
obligation, the most Mt. Vernon will get in the way of reimbursement is 50% of the net
GA issued, or approximately $5,000.
There are a few other criteria that must be applied before a municipality is reimbursed by the
state. First, the municipality must be administering its program in accordance with state
law. Second, the state will not reimburse municipalities for assistance granted out of locally
established charity trust funds unless there are no limits on the use of the trust proceeds by
terms of the trust agreement itself, and the trust proceeds are issued in complete
conformance with GA law and regulation. Finally, the municipality must file periodic
reports and claims for reimbursement with DHHS. It is important to note that municipalities
do not have to reach their “obligation” in order to submit for DHHS reimbursement.
155
Reports
All municipalities must file reports with DHHS that detail their GA expenditures. The
reimbursement claim forms are provided by DHHS. Municipalities which have received
“90%” reimbursement in the past or which anticipate that they will be spending over
obligation must submit monthly reports. Municipalities that do not expect to be reimbursed
at the “90%” level in the current fiscal year must submit either quarterly or semi-annual
reports (§ 4311(2)(B)). Finally, if the municipality does not anticipate spending over its
obligation, and is therefore submitting quarterly claims for reimbursement, but suddenly
finds midway through the fiscal year that GA spending has surpassed the obligation
threshold, the municipality must immediately begin filing monthly claims for
reimbursement.
The state is not required to reimburse any municipality which does not submit the reports in
a timely manner. If a report is not submitted within 90 days of the time period covered in the
report, and there is no “good cause” for the late submission, the state is under no obligation
to reimburse the municipality.
The current law creates an obligation level of .0003 times the municipality’s most recent
state valuation; administrators must remember to adjust the obligation accordingly on the
first claim forms that are submitted each fiscal year. DHHS sends municipalities notices
regarding their “obligations” in March of every year. For example, a municipality that is
submitting monthly claim forms must remember to calculate the correct obligation on the
claim form filed each August covering GA issued during the month of July, the first month
of a new fiscal year. That new obligation level will be the obligation to use on every claim
form during that fiscal year. The particular state valuation for all municipalities is certified
to the assessor(s) of the municipality no later than February 1 of each year, and municipal
GA administrators should track that number down in a timely manner so that the upcoming
year’s GA budget can be reasonably calculated and the determination can be made with
regard to which reimbursement formula to choose.
Unincorporated Places
The DHHS appoints people to serve as GA administrators to handle the program in the
unorganized territories. Often the state will contract with a nearby municipality to administer
GA in the unorganized territory. When this occurs the state reimburses the municipality for
100% of its expenses related to providing assistance in the unorganized territories. However,
if a municipality has not been designated to accept applications for residents of an
unorganized territory and a resident of the territory applies for GA at the local town office,
the GA administrator should contact DHHS to find out where the applicant should apply.

CHAPTER 11 – Questions & Answers
The following are some commonly asked questions about General Assistance, with answers
supplied.
Application
Q. A couple with a three-year-old child applied for assistance in Monmouth. They are
significantly over income, but they are out of food and they won’t be paid for two days.
This is their first application. Must Monmouth help?
A. Probably yes. Even though they are over income they have an immediate need
(i.e., emergency) and no way to fulfill that need. Monmouth must assist them with
enough GA for food until they are paid (two days). If this were a repeat application, the
Monmouth administrator could apply any standards limiting emergency assistance that
are established in the local ordinance, but for a first-time application, it would be more
reasonable to grant the emergency GA and warn the applicants that they must document
all future expenditures in order to preserve their eligibility for future assistance.
Q. A couple with a seven-year-old child applied for GA in Sabattus on Tuesday. Their
income is $1,500 a month. They are requesting assistance with their $250 light bill
since their electricity is going to be shut off on Monday, but they will receive a $375
paycheck on Friday. This is an initial application. Must Sabattus pay?
A. No. The family is clearly over income and in no immediate need, since they will
receive a paycheck on Friday that will be more than enough to pay the light bill and
avert the disconnection of service.
Q. If an applicant applies for assistance and is eligible for several types of assistance but
only requests food, is the administrator required to inform him that he could apply for
other things? Does the law require the municipality to grant automatically the “gap”
between income and allowed expenses?
A. There are at least two GA program requirements which serve as notice to applicants
about what they are eligible to receive. First, the municipal ordinance must be readily
available to all applicants. Second, the application process necessarily involves a
comprehensive review of the applicant’s basic-need budget—a review with the
applicant that results in the determination of the applicant’s unmet need. These two
requirements act to provide applicants with the knowledge of their potential eligibility,
158
and there is no express legal obligation that an administrator apprise all applicants of
their maximum eligibility. In other words, you have to help eligible applicants with
requested assistance. If they do not request everything they are eligible for on a
particular application you may certainly inform them of the full extent of their
eligibility. But if you do not, be aware that they may reapply during the period of
eligibility to receive the remaining assistance they are eligible for.
Q. There are several families in town who receive assistance every single month. In fact,
they’ve received assistance every month for the past three years! I thought General
Assistance was a temporary program for emergencies only. How much longer do we
have to assist these families?
A. There is a conflict in the definition of GA. On the one hand it says that GA is a service
“administered by a municipality for the immediate aid of persons who are unable to
provide the basic necessities essential to maintain themselves or their families.” It
further defines the program as one that provides a “specific amount and type of aid” for
defined needs during a limited period of time and is not intended to be a continuing
“grant-in-aid” or “categorical welfare program” (§ 4301). This seems to say that people
can receive assistance only for a limited time. However, the next sentence makes the
previous one somewhat meaningless since it states: “This definition shall not in any
way lessen the responsibility of each municipality to provide general assistance to a
person each time that person has need and is found to be otherwise eligible to receive
general assistance.” So while GA is intended, in theory, to be a limited program, in
practice and in law, it must be granted for as long as the applicant is eligible.
Q. Who is the proper person to apply for GA? Our ordinance requires that the “head of the
household” applies. Sometimes there’s a man in the household but he always sends his
wife in. Do we have to take an application from her?
A. Anyone may apply for GA. The administrator should only be concerned that the person
applying can provide all the necessary information that you need to determine whether
the household is eligible. Depending on the household composition, only one adult
could be required to apply. But if there are two adults, and either or both are required to
do workfare or fulfill other eligibility conditions, it is reasonable to expect them both to
apply at the same time.
159
Confidentiality
Q. An attorney for one of our recipients requested a copy of her GA file. Should I give it to
the attorney?
A. You should release an applicant’s or recipient’s records only if you have a “consent
form” signed by the applicant or recipient giving permission to the administrator to
release the record. The law (§ 4306) only requires that the applicant give “express”
permission prior to the release of confidential information to the general public.
A Superior Court case has upheld a municipality’s interpretation of “express”
permission as written permission. Janek v. Ives, Aroostook County Superior Court,
#CV-89-116 (1997). Even with the Janek decision, in the case where an attorney is
requesting the record on behalf of a client, particularly when the claim is being made
that an emergency exists, you could release the information to the attorney on the
client’s oral consent. In any other situation, a written release should be required.
Q. One day while some applicants were waiting to apply for GA, I overheard one of them
tell another that he had committed a recent robbery at a nearby store. I know that
information pertaining to GA applicants is supposed to be confidential, but I think I
have an obligation to report this to the police and wonder if I may.
A. Yes. The GA confidentiality provisions require that information relating to
GA applicants not be disclosed to the general public. In this case you would not be
disclosing the kind of information specifically protected by the law (i.e., contents of the
application, etc.). The police would not be considered the “public” in this instance.
In order to completely ensure your protection against any claim involving a breach of
confidentiality, it would be advisable to make sure that you are covered by the town’s
public officials liability insurance. In addition, whenever you go to the police with
information about a client you should inform the police officer of your confidentiality
responsibilities and you should ask that the police not use you as a witness unless all
else fails. If you are called upon to testify in court, raise the confidentiality issue in
court and let the judge decide.
Q. We are contemplating taking a former GA recipient to Small Claims Court to recover
our expenses. He just received $25,000 from the Lottery. Will that be a violation of his
confidentiality?
A. You should write a letter to the recipient reminding him of his obligation to repay the
municipality and ask him to voluntarily repay his obligation. Inform him that if he
160
doesn’t contact you within a specific amount of time, the municipality will be forced to
bring him to Small Claims Court. If it is necessary to bring the recipient to court to
recover the debt, it is a good idea to inform the court of the confidentiality provision. It
is recommended that the complainant inform the court, on the “statement of claim”
form which will have to be filed, that the information contained in GA records is
confidential by law pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A. § 4306. Let the court decide what
information is to be released for the record and also how to administer the proceeding
in order to effectuate confidentiality.
Q. Our town has several charitable organizations that give “care baskets” of food and
clothing during the year. Can we release the names of our GA recipients to these groups
so they can receive these baskets?
A. No. The identity of GA recipients is totally confidential to the general public. You
could ask your recipients if they would like to receive a basket and, if so, get their
permission to release their names to the charitable agencies.
Fair Hearings
Q. I know that fair hearings are “de novo” but I’m confused. Is the Fair Hearing Authority
supposed to decide if the claimants were eligible at the time they applied or at the time
of the fair hearing?
A. The job of the Fair Hearing Authority is to determine, based on all the evidence
presented at the fair hearing, whether the claimants were eligible to receive assistance
at the time they applied, and whether the administrator’s decision was correct. Often a
person’s circumstances change between the day they apply and the time of the hearing.
If this is the case, the Fair Hearing Authority could determine people were ineligible
when they applied but suggest that they reapply for GA to have their eligibility redetermined
in light of the changes in their circumstances that occurred after the date of
the decision at appeal.
Q. An applicant requested a fair hearing. We scheduled it, he said he would be there, but
he didn’t show up. This was our first fair hearing and we didn’t know what to do. What
should we have done?
A. Under Maine law fair hearings are de novo which means that the hearing officer(s)
determines the person’s eligibility anew and not just on the basis of the administrator’s
reasons contained in the decision. Because the fair hearing must consider the claimant’s
161
eligibility from a fresh perspective, the officer(s) has the right to question the claimant.
If the claimant doesn’t attend the hearing, the officer(s) is not able to ask questions.
In the situation you described, the Fair Hearing Authority should have convened the hearing,
noted for the record whom were present, that the claimant didn’t attend, and that there being
no evidence or information to the contrary, the administrator’s decision would stand and be
unchanged. A letter to that effect should then be sent to the claimant (see “Claimant’s
Failure to Appear” in the “Fair Hearing Authority’s Reference Manual,” Chapter 12).
Fraud
Q. A man applied for GA in Belmont. He supplied a written statement from the landlord
verifying that the applicant lived at that address. The administrator is sure that it is a
forgery. Can she disqualify him for making a false representation?
A. This alone would not be a sufficient basis to disqualify an applicant. First of all, the
administrator is not a handwriting expert so she should attempt to contact the landlord.
Secondly, people can be disqualified for fraud only if the false statement relates to a
material fact; that is, a fact which has a direct bearing on the applicant’s eligibility.
Whether an applicant’s landlord is Mr. Smith or Mrs. Jones isn’t necessarily material,
provided there is a bona fide landlord. What is important is the location of the
apartment (in order to determine the municipality of responsibility and the housing
vendor), the amount of rent, and whether there are any other people in the household.
The administrator needs more information before she can determine eligibility or be
sure that this is a case of fraud.
Q. Two weeks ago I disqualified an applicant for 120 days for committing fraud. Now his
wife and two-year-old child are applying for GA. The man now has a job but won’t be
paid for one week and they have no available cash. Am I supposed to help?
A. You are required to help the wife and child since they did not commit fraud and
therefore were not disqualified. However, you are not required to help the husband
whom you disqualified for 120 days. You should grant a one week food voucher for
two people (the mother and child only) to cover their expenses until the paycheck
arrives.
162
Housing
Q. A family of four was evicted. The sheriff came and padlocked their apartment. Now
they are in the town office telling us that we must find them housing! Must we?
A. Generally speaking, the applicants are responsible for finding suitable housing; the
municipality is responsible for paying for the housing to the extent the applicants are
eligible. As is the case with almost everything in GA, however, it depends on the
situation. If the applicants have no housing and it is an emergency because there are no
alternatives, the municipality may have to place people in a motel temporarily. Rather
than locate people in a motel, it might be wise for the municipality to help people find
permanent housing.
Q. Two of the selectpersons refuse to grant assistance to couples who live together without
being married because they say the town should not be supporting an immoral situation.
I don’t necessarily agree with the situation but don’t think we can legally make these
sort of judgments. Who’s right?
A. If applicants are eligible for assistance based on objective criteria (income, expenses,
assets, work requirements, etc.) then they must be granted assistance regardless of
whether the administrators agree with the applicants’ lifestyle.
Liability of Relatives
Q. Claudine and Martin are sister and brother. Martin lived in Claudine’s house until she
kicked him out after they had a fight. Now Martin is applying for GA. Must the town
help? Can we require Claudine to help?
A. The town must grant Martin GA if he has insufficient income. The town cannot require
Claudine to help or to reimburse the town, because as Martin’s sister, she is not legally
liable for his support. Certainly it makes sense to encourage relatives to help each other,
but sisters and brothers are not required by law to help each other so municipalities
cannot deny applicants if a brother or sister refuses to help.
Q. Our town has been helping a mother and her 13-year-old daughter for the past four
months. The mother is separated from her husband who lives in the next town. He
refuses to give them any support. We have sent him bills for the assistance we have
given his wife and child, but to date he has ignored our bills. Can we require him to do
workfare?
163
A. No. The only people who can be assigned workfare are those who are able to work and
who have actually received the assistance. Although the man is deriving some indirect
benefit by the town giving GA to his wife and daughter, he is not actually receiving
GA. The most you could do would be to sue him in Small Claims Court. Be aware that
there is a 12-month limitation on your ability to recover GA funds from liable relatives
in Small Claims Court. You might also contact the Support Enforcement Unit of the
DHHS to see if they can assist in securing support payments from the husband.
Q. An 18-year-old woman and her baby receiving TANF rent an apartment in the building
her parents own. She has applied for GA to pay the rent. Aren’t the parents responsible?
A. Yes. Since she is not in any danger of eviction and has no immediate shelter need, you
should deny her rental assistance and inform the daughter that under state law her
parents are considered both legally liable and potential resources for her and her child’s
support. Be aware that the parents may be resentful and tell her to move out to a
different apartment. You should make it clear that even if this happens, the parents
continue to be legally liable for their daughter’s support, at least until the daughter is 25
years of age.
Furthermore, § 4319 of Title 22 provides that a municipality may elect not to make rental
payments to an applicant’s immediate relatives, regardless of the age of the applicant,
unless two conditions are met: First, the rental relationship must have existed for at least
three months and the rental income to the parents must be necessary to provide the parents
with their basic necessities.
Therefore, even if your client was not a minor and her parents had no legal liability to
provide her with financial support, there would be no obligation to pay rent to the
applicant’s parents unless they were themselves in need of GA, and the rental relationship
had been established for at least three months. Keep in mind that regardless of the
applicant’s age you would have to assist her with the basic necessities other than shelter if
the parents refused to provide support and she was otherwise eligible. The parents’ legal
obligation to provide support cannot be construed as the minor having “no unmet need”
when the parents, in fact, are unwilling or unable to provide the necessary support directly.
Maximum Levels
Q. We have a family of four in our town who has applied each week for the past month.
Both parents work but they never have enough money to pay for all their basic
necessities. Their income exceeds the maximum levels that we allow in our ordinance
164
so we have denied them. Pine Tree Legal called today and said that we have to give
them assistance in excess of what our ordinance allow. Is this true?
A. Generally speaking this is not true. The maximum levels in your ordinance should be
followed closely. The only exception to this would be if the applicants had an
emergency that necessitated that the ordinance be exceeded. For instance, if they
received an eviction notice, or if they used their income to repair the furnace and
consequently didn’t have enough money for food. Keep in mind that the maximum
levels established in your ordinance for the specific basic necessities must be
reasonable and reflect the cost of living in your community. If most of your applicants’
rent payments, for instance, are always more than what the ordinance allows you should
adjust your maximum levels. In this case, you should inform the applicants that if they
wish to preserve their future eligibility for GA, they must carefully document all
expenditures of household income. Any income not spent on basic necessities will not
be replaced with GA funds.
Q. We’ve been receiving a lot of requests for overdue electric bills and rent bills. These
applicants could have applied for GA at the time they were having trouble paying their
bills, but they have waited until the last minute. Does the law require that we bail them
out now?
A. Not necessarily. The first step in the process is to evaluate the eligibility of the
household for non-emergency GA; that is, does the household have a deficit (i.e., a gap
between the household income and the overall maximum level of assistance for that
household allowed by law)? If so, try to determine if all the household’s needs for the
next 30 days—including any utility disconnection or eviction problem—can be met by
disbursing GA up to the amount of the household’s deficit. The household would be
eligible for its deficit even if it were not facing an emergency situation, so if the
household’s regular basic needs and the emergency needs can both be addressed within
the deficit, so much the better.
If the overdue light bill or rent bill has created an emergency situation which cannot be
alleviated within the applicant’s deficit, the next step is to determine if the applicant could
have averted or avoided the emergency situation with his or her own finances and resources.
If the applicant could have wholly or partially avoided the emergency, financially, but some
of the applicant’s income was spent on unnecessary goods or services, the municipality has
no legal obligation to replace that misspent income. Consult the standards in your ordinance
governing limitations on emergency assistance. Those standards are designed to implement
165
a policy that was woven into GA law in 1991. In simple terms, that policy is that no one is
automatically eligible for either “regular” GA or emergency GA to replace income that
could have been used for basic necessities.
Residency
Q. A man who used to live in Sidney moved into Belgrade. After he had been in Belgrade
one week, he applied for food at the Belgrade town office. The administrator told him
to apply to Sidney for help because he had been in Belgrade less than one month. Was
the Belgrade Administrator correct?
A. No. The man moved to Belgrade voluntarily without any assistance from Sidney,
therefore Sidney was not responsible for him. If Sidney had given the man GA to help
him relocate to Belgrade, then Sidney would have been financially responsible for his
GA until he had lived in Belgrade for 30 days.
Q. A woman is living in a shelter for victims of domestic violence which is located in
Saco. Prior to entering the facility four months ago, she lived in Biddeford. She has
found an apartment in Old Orchard Beach and needs the first month’s rent. Who is
responsible?
A. Biddeford, because she is in a shelter, has been there less than six months, and
Biddeford is where she lived immediately prior to entering the facility.
Q. Our town received a bill from Oxford because a family from our town moved to
Oxford. The Oxford administrator gave the family a food voucher but now Oxford
wants us to reimburse them. Do we have an obligation?
A. Your question turns on whether or not your town granted GA to this household within
the last 30 days in order for the family to move to Oxford. If the family now applying to
Oxford did not receive assistance from you to move to Oxford within the last 30 days,
you have no obligation to reimburse Oxford for the GA it is now issuing to the family.
If you did use GA to help the family move to Oxford, you would be responsible for any
GA issued to that family, such as this food order, within the first 30 days of relocation.
In an effort to avoid confusion, it is a good practice for a municipality which helps a
family move to another municipality to notify the “receiving” municipality.
In another situation, let’s say that the family was applying in Town A, but was clearly not
Town A’s responsibility because the family’s home was in Town B and they intended to
166
remain in Town B. They were simply unaware of where to apply and a friend of theirs had
suggested they apply in Town A. In this case, where there is no dispute regarding residency,
Town A should contact Town B to determine how to proceed.
As a result of that communication, the applicants could either be informed about when and
where to apply to Town B, or Town B could give permission to Town A to grant the family
necessary assistance this one time and send a bill to Town B for reimbursement. State law
requires municipalities which assist people for whom they are not responsible to give prior
notice to the municipality from whom they expect reimbursement (§ 4313). It is good
practice for a town that helps a family move to another town to notify the “receiving”
municipality. It is important for municipalities to cooperate with one another in
administering GA.
Work Requirement
Q. A woman had been receiving GA regularly for about one year. She had been assigned
to do workfare and she performed well. It has been three months since she last received
GA. She still “owes” 24 hours worth of workfare. Must she complete this before we can
give her more assistance?
A. No. It is not uncommon for a recipient to receive more GA than can be worked-off
during their period of eligibility. Sometimes the reason for this is that the GA grant is
so large there are simply not enough hours in the period of eligibility for the entire
grant to be worked off. It is also sometimes the case that the municipality is unable to
assign enough work to cover the entire GA grant because of the time of the year or the
lack of supervision. It is the responsibility of the municipality to create the work
assignment during the period of eligibility for which the applicant received the GA.
Generally, the municipality cannot fail to assign the workfare in a timely manner and
instead “bank” the workfare hours for sometime in the distant future. The exception to
this general rule is when it is the recipient, not the municipality, who fails to perform
the workfare assigned without just cause. In this circumstance, the number of hours that
were assigned and not worked by the recipient should be identified and the recipient
should be disqualified until the total number of assigned workfare hours are made up.
Q. Our town has a GA recipient who applies for assistance and agrees to do workfare. We
give him a month’s rent and then he never shows up for work so we disqualify him for
120 days. But, like clockwork, he’s back in on the 121st day to reapply. This has
happened a couple of times now. He currently owes us about 250 hours in workfare.
Can we disqualify him until he works his hours? What can we do?
167
A. Maine law permits municipalities to disqualify people for 120 days if they do not
comply with the workfare requirement. This 120-day period of ineligibility, if applied
to an applicant, should be viewed as the penalty for not performing the workfare
assignment, and when the applicant reapplies for GA after the ineligibility period has
expired, the administrator would be well advised to start off again with a clean
workfare slate.
When you are dealing with GA recipients who have poor workfare records, it would be very
reasonable to employ the “workfare first” option that was authorized by a change to GA law
in 1993. Under the “workfare first” policy, this recipient would now be granted assistance
on the condition of a successful completion of the workfare assignment. If he decides not to
do the workfare, the GA grant would be terminated before it was actually issued.
Another approach you might take with a recipient such as this, who has a poor workfare
record, would be to change the duration of time for which you grant assistance. For instance,
you can reduce the period of eligibility by granting help with food one day at a time. For
every day he works, you’ll grant him one day’s worth of food. If you’ve been granting rental
assistance monthly you might want to consider granting it on a weekly basis. In this way,
there is an incentive for the recipient to perform workfare and if he fails to comply, the
municipality will have saved some money.
Q. The workers at the major employer in our town just went on strike. Do we have to grant
assistance to strikers?
A. The first time striking workers apply for assistance their eligibility must be determined
the same as any other first time applicant. If they are in need, and are eligible, they
must be assisted. Thereafter, strikers must fulfill the same eligibility conditions as other
recipients. They must comply with the work requirements and they must use all
available resources to reduce their need for GA. The fact that the striker has a job to
return to, but chooses not to due to the strike, should be interpreted, as the striker’s
failure to utilize an available resource. The striker should be given a written notice
providing him or her with 7 days to secure the resource (i.e., return to work) or,
commence a work search for new full-time employment.
If the striker decides not to cross the picket line (i.e., does not utilize the available resource)
he or she should be found ineligible until the time the resource is utilized. If on the other
hand the striker fulfills the work search requirement, they should be deemed eligible
provided the other eligibility criteria are met.
168
If strikers say they cannot fulfill the work requirements (i.e., look for work, perform
workfare) because they have to be on the picket line, the administrator should explain that
they will have to either arrange their picket line schedule around their work search and/or
workfare assignments or be found ineligible. If a striker refuses to comply with any work
requirement, the striker should be found ineligible to receive GA.
If strikers have assets that can be converted into cash (extra cars, recreational vehicles,
insurance policies, retirement funds etc.), they are required to make a good faith attempt to
liquidate or sell the assets at fair market value. Failure to do so will result in their
ineligibility. As an aside, most strikers will have “pension plans” of one kind or another,
which they should be made to access since retirement accounts are “available resources.”
As a result, they will most likely be found over income upon their second application.
Remember, if a striker is found ineligible for failure to comply with the program rules or
requirements, his or her family may still be eligible.
NOTE: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) does not share this
opinion. DHHS advises that municipalities treat strikers as applicants who are ineligible for
120 days due to a “job quit.” However, MMA takes the position that striking is not
analogous to job quit and as a result a denial of GA on such grounds could be challenged. A
more defensible position is one of treating a striker as an applicant who must take advantage
of an available resource (just as any other applicant would be made to do). Regrettably,
since there is a split in opinion, municipalities must choose a position and apply it
consistently to all strikers in their municipality.
Q. Craig has been receiving GA for months. He is in his mid-twenties and able-bodied.
Although he always agrees to do workfare, he never shows up when assigned and is
disqualified for 120 days. He knows he can re-qualify for assistance if he “otherwise
complies” with the law so very often he’ll come in the office late Friday afternoon
saying he is willing to do his workfare assignment. Our public works crews are usually
done for the day and therefore we don’t have any work for him to do. He and his
attorney say that’s our problem and that if he’s willing to work we have to grant him
assistance. Do we have to drop everything and cater to his demands?
A. Certainly this behavior is neither reasonable nor responsible, and the law governing an
applicant’s right to regain eligibility after failing (without just cause) to adequately
perform a workfare assignment was amended in 1991 to address this issue.
169
The law (§ 4316-A(4)) requires a municipality to limit the number of opportunities a person
must be given to regain eligibility after a workfare disqualification. As a matter of law, a
workfare participant who has been disqualified for a workfare failure is entitled to only one
opportunity to regain eligibility. The way to take advantage of the law is to be very clear
with your paperwork.
As soon as a workfare participant fails to perform an assignment and there is no “just cause”
reason for that failure, a written notice should be immediately issued to the participant
disqualifying him or her for 120 days. Upon receiving such a notice, the workfare
participant could either appeal the decision or attempt to regain eligibility. If the workfare
participant wanted to regain eligibility, he or she would have to contact the administrator
and request a workfare assignment. If such a request is made, the administrator must grant
the participant one single new workfare assignment if the administrator wishes to enforce the
ineligibility period.
Generally, it is only if (and when) the participant adequately performs the new assignment
that his or her eligibility for any GA will be reinstated. (An exception to this would be if the
town did not have any work assignments immediately available. If an applicant had to wait
a week for an opportunity to regain eligibility and was out of food in the meantime, the
administrator should grant an emergency food order, as a matter of good faith, to cover that
period of time.) If the participant does not adequately perform the workfare re-assignment
and there is no just cause for that failure, the original 120-day ineligibility period could be
enforced by the administrator for its original duration.
Miscellaneous
Q. We have a landlord in our town who rents primarily to GA recipients. He has not paid
taxes on several of his apartment buildings. When the town grants rental payments for
his tenants, can the town keep the money and put it toward the unpaid taxes the
landlord owes?
A. No. The tenants are eligible to receive the GA for their rent and should not be used as
pawns to help the town receive payment of delinquent taxes. Some municipalities refer
to a section of taxation law found in 36 M.R.S.A. § 905 for authority to implement the
“set off” procedure which you are describing. That law allows the municipal treasurer
to “withhold payment of any money then due and payable (by the municipality) to any
taxpayer whose taxes are due and wholly or partially unpaid... The sum withheld shall
be paid to the tax collector...” It is the opinion of the attorneys in MMA’s Legal
Services Department that GA rental payments may not be set off because the
170
municipality is merely paying the rent on behalf of the tenant, and the legal obligation
to pay that rent continues to rest solely with the tenant. To “set off” GA rental payments
against unpaid taxes could negatively affect the tenant.
Q. We routinely refer all new applicants to the police for investigation to see if they have a
criminal record and to make sure that they are telling the truth. Is this proper?
A. No. The police have no role in the regular administration of general assistance. If the
administrator has a good reason to suspect fraud regarding an application, the police
may be brought in to help investigate, but the police should not be used in the routine
administration of GA.
Q. We have over drafted our GA budget and it will be four months before our next regular
town meeting. Do we have to have a special town meeting to appropriate the money
necessary to cover our GA account?
A. It is not necessary to schedule a special town meeting just for the purpose of covering a
GA overdraft. The appropriation to cover a GA overdraft, however, should be
considered at the next available town meeting opportunity. GA overdrafts are different
from overdrafts of other accounts because the municipality is not at liberty to control
the GA budget. With regard to nearly every other financial account, when the municipal
officers authorize overdrafts, they could be held personally responsible for that
municipal debt if the legislative body does not subsequently ratify the overdraft by
appropriating the funds necessary to cover it. This is not the case with GA overdrafts.
The municipal official could not be held personally responsible for a GA overdraft
because the program is mandated by state law and regulation and the municipal officers
have no authority to control GA expenditure. When a town meeting municipality
overdrafts its GA budget, the municipal officers should make sure that the necessary
appropriation is placed on the warrant for the next available town meeting, but it is not
necessary to schedule a special town meeting only for that purpose.
Q. We recently received a food voucher that was being redeemed by a local grocery store.
Along with our voucher was a copy of the receipt. When our treasurer was preparing
the check for the grocery store, she subtracted from the total purchase price the amount
of sales tax included. The grocery store said we shouldn’t subtract the sales tax and
referred us to the state Department of Taxation. We have always understood
municipalities to be exempt from the sales tax. Who is right?
171
A. Municipalities are exempt from paying sales tax. In this case, however, and as odd as it
might sound, the municipality is not really purchasing the food. The municipality is
providing a form of public assistance to an eligible recipient, and it is the recipient who
is making the food purchase. Tax-exempt status, generally, is not derivative; that is, it
cannot be transferred to third parties who are not themselves tax-exempt. Therefore,
your treasurer should be honoring the food voucher up to its face value regardless of the
sales tax applied.
One way to avoid paying the sales tax for taxable food items would be to implement a
policy that would allow the purchase of only non-taxable food items with municipal
food vouchers. The principal advantages of such a policy would be to increase the
buying power of the food voucher and also ensure in a convenient way that “snack”
foods, which are presently taxed under Maine law, would not be purchased with GA
vouchers. The disadvantage of such a policy is that what are and what are not taxable
food items will not always be clear to the recipient when he or she is in the grocery
store and, as a result, confusion and embarrassment may reign at the checkout counter.
For that reason, if a town does intend to implement a policy allowing only non-taxable
food items, all recipients should be given a list of taxable and non-taxable food items.
Area supermarkets, probably, can provide such a list.
Q: We recently received the model MMA General Assistance ordinance and have several
questions about what to do with it. Can you tell us how to adopt the ordinance and
whether there are any other things we should be aware of?
A: Maine law is not very specific about the procedure for adopting a General Assistance
(GA) ordinance. Title 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(1) merely requires that municipalities
administer a GA program “in accordance with an ordinance enacted after notice and
hearing by the municipal officers.” Assuming that your municipality doesn’t have a
local charter provision providing a different process for adopting an ordinance, the
procedure we suggest is one that is very similar to that used for adopting a traffic
ordinance. 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3009. We suggest the following format:
1. The municipal officers must post notice at least seven days prior to the time of the
meeting at which the GA ordinance is to be considered for adoption and that notice must
be posted in the same place as the town meeting warrant (See Appendix 1 for sample
“Notice.”) If your town customarily posts in two or more places, the same number of
postings would apply to these notices. Although not required, a newspaper ad or
announcement may be appropriate.
172
2. Notice must give the date, the time, and the place of the municipal officers’ meeting and
public hearing.
3. The notice must either have the proposed ordinance and/or amendments attached or
inform people where they may review the ordinance.
At the time of the meeting the municipal officers should place the ordinance before the
meeting for general discussion, and by way of a statement, explain the need for the
ordinance. After that, the public hearing should be opened in order to give people the right
to ask questions and engage in general discussion concerning the ordinance itself. After
people have had an opportunity to express their views, the municipal officers should close
the public hearing and proceed with the consideration of the ordinance.
The enactment is not difficult. It may be accomplished by a motion made by one of the
municipal officers, seconded by another, and voted upon by majority vote. Because there
must be a record of the action, it is suggested that the town clerk be present, record the
motion, record the second, and poll and record the individual votes of the municipal officers.
The minutes of the town clerk plus a certified copy of the ordinance enacted should be
recorded in the town’s records in the same manner as an action by a town meeting.
Once the ordinance is adopted, a signed copy (or notice thereof) must be filed with the
Department of Health and Human Services, Bureau of Family Independence, State House
Station #11, Augusta, 04333. Municipalities are also required to file any amendments to the
GA ordinance and any GA forms they use (applications, budget sheets, decisions, etc.) each
time there are changes. Don’t forget to adopt by October 1st (of each year) the new
Appendixes A-C containing the yearly GA maximums, which MMA sends to all
municipalities. DHHS must also receive confirmation that the municipality has adopted the
appropriate maximums each year.
Finally, it is a good idea to appoint a Fair Hearing Authority (FHA) at the time you adopt a
GA ordinance and clarify your ordinance regarding the composition of the FHA.
Municipalities are required to appoint a FHA to hear appeals from dissatisfied applicants,
and your ordinance should be amended to clarify whether the municipal officers, a board of
citizens, or an individual will serve as FHA.
Q: I have a client who repeatedly refuses to provide her Social Security number and those
of her family members. I would like to use the numbers for verification of both income
and public benefits. Can I require her to provide the numbers?
173
A: Yes. It is the opinion of MMA legal staff that under the General Assistance statutes
(22 M.R.S.A. § § 4301 et seq.) and the body of law known as municipal “Home Rule”
authority found at 30-A M.R.S.A. § § 3001, municipal GA ordinances can require that
GA applicants provide their Social Security numbers for purposes of GA
administration. Home Rule authority provides municipalities the right to enact
ordinances (municipal in nature) that do not frustrate or run counter to a state law
and/or which the state has not prohibited the municipality from passing.
Section 4305 of our general assistance statutes requires the following:
1. Program required; ordinance. A general assistance program shall be operated by
each municipality and shall be administered in accordance with an ordinance
enacted, after notice and hearing, by the municipal officers of each municipality.
(Emphasis added)
and
2. Standards of eligibility. Municipalities may establish standards of eligibility, in
addition to need, as provided in this chapter. Each ordinance shall establish
standards which shall:
A. Govern the determination of eligibility of persons applying for relief and the
amount of assistance to be provided to eligible persons; (Emphasis added)
By virtue of § 4305, it is difficult to argue that a municipality’s authority, vis-à-vis its GA
ordinance, is not sufficiently “broad” to require that GA applicants provide their Social
Security numbers. Furthermore Section 4.3 of the MMA model GA ordinance (re: Contents
of the Application) clearly requires that:
At a minimum, the application will contain the following information:
1. applicant’s name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and phone number;
2. names, date(s) of birth, and Social Security number(s) of other household members for
whom the applicant is seeking assistance;
3. total number of individuals in the building or apartment where the applicant is residing;
4. employment and employability information;
5. all household income, resources, assets, and property;
174
6. household expenses;
7. types of assistance being requested;
8. penalty for false representation;
9. applicant’s permission to verify information;
10. signature of applicant and date.
As a result of a municipality’s Home Rule authority in this area and, the very clear
requirements (eligibility criteria) established by our MMA model GA ordinance (which not
only do not frustrate the purpose of the GA law but are clearly “in sync” with § 4305), it is
our opinion that municipalities having adopted the MMA model may require GA applicants
to provide their Social Security numbers.
However, in the event the applicant is a “first time” applicant who has lost his or her number
for example, or the applicant provides other evidence evincing “just cause” for the failure to
provide the number, the municipality should provide the applicant the opportunity to obtain
the Social Security number. The municipality in such a case should provide the applicant a
seven-day written notice of the requirement (i.e., on the notice of eligibility or ineligibility)
and instruct the applicant that he or she will be required to provide the number (or proof of a
“good faith” effort to secure the number) next time they apply for GA. Furthermore, if the
applicant has an immediate “emergency” need and they are otherwise eligible, the applicant
should be provided sufficient GA to take care of any immediate need. If on the other hand a
repeat applicant, who has been properly instructed to provide the number upon his or her
next application, refuses without a legitimate reason to provide the number, he or she should
be found ineligible for failure to provide the GA administrator with information necessary to
verify eligibility. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4309 (1-B).
NOTE: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) does not share this
opinion. DHHS advises that municipalities may not deny benefits to individuals who refuse
to provide Social Security numbers. As a result of DHHS’s opinion, until the time this issue
is resolved municipalities do encounter a modicum of risk should they deny an applicant GA
based on the applicant’s failure to provide his or her Social Security number. However,
MMA takes the position that such a denial of GA (based on the above analysis) is a
defensible position and that municipalities take only a calculated risk that they will be
appealed for such a determination.

CHAPTER 12 – Fair Hearing Authority Reference Manual
Please Note: The contents of this manual are intended to provide general guidance and
should not be relied upon by the reader as the sole source of information. The reader should
seek further counsel and information in dealing with a specific problem by contacting the
Maine Municipal Association or a private attorney.
When an applicant for General Assistance is dissatisfied with a decision regarding his or her
request for assistance, the applicant may request a Fair Hearing. This reference manual is
intended to help the Fair Hearing Authority (FHA) conduct a hearing more effectively and
reach a fair decision. It is important for the FHA to understand its duties and the hearing
procedures.
The basic role of the Fair Hearing Authority is to determine, based on all the evidence
presented at the fair hearing, whether the claimant(s) were eligible to receive assistance at
the time they applied for GA, and whether the administrator’s decision was correct.
GA ordinances vary from municipality to municipality and the Fair Hearing Authority
should be familiar with the individual municipality’s GA ordinance before the Fair Hearing.
FHAs with questions regarding statutory interpretation relative to the general assistance law,
DHHS policy and other such matters may seek clarification from DHHS prior to the
commencement of a fair hearing, but may not consult with DHHS regarding the merits of
the case.
Right to a Fair Hearing
As a matter of law, any GA applicant who is dissatisfied with the decision of the GA
administrator on his or her application has the right to appeal that decision to the Fair
Hearing Authority, hereinafter referred to as “the Authority.” 22 M.R.S.A. § 4321.
At the time the administrator gives a decision on an applicant’s request for the GA, the
administrator must notify the applicant in writing that if dissatisfied, the applicant has the
right to appeal the decision within five working days. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4322.
The reasons why a person may want a Fair Hearing include:
1. failure of the administrator to render a written decision within 24 hours;
2. the administrator’s refusal to accept an application or reapplication;
176
3. dissatisfaction with the administrator’s decision.
The law further requires that if the municipality decides to reduce or terminate the assistance
during the period of eligibility, the recipient has a right to be notified of such impending
action and has a right to a hearing before the assistance is reduced or terminated.
22 M.R.S.A. § 4321.
Process for Filing a Request for a Fair Hearing
Any applicant who is aggrieved by the action or non-action of the GA administrator may
request a Fair Hearing. The applicant must request a hearing within five working days of
receiving a written notice of denial, reduction or termination, or within ten working days
after any other act or failure to act on an application. Once an applicant has made a clear
expression that he or she desires a fair hearing, the administrator should have the applicant
complete a written request for a hearing (see Appendix 17 for a sample form).
Upon receiving the written request, the administrator must take all the steps necessary to
schedule a fair hearing. The hearing must be held within five working days of receiving the
request. Requests for fair hearings that are not received within the statutory period will not
be considered timely filed and the applicant will have forfeited the right to a fair hearing.
The administrator should tell the applicant why he or she can’t have a fair hearing this time,
and let the applicant know he or she may file a new application for assistance.
Scheduling a Fair Hearing—Notice
Once a GA administrator has received a written request for a fair hearing, the administrator
must schedule one. The hearing must take place within five working days of receiving the
request. The administrator must notify the FHA that a request has been filed, and arrange for
a hearing to be held at a time that is mutually convenient for the FHA and the claimant.
The hearing should be held as soon as possible, keeping in mind that it must be held within
five working days, and each side should be given ample opportunity to prepare its case.
Forty-eight hours advance notice is reasonable, if possible. As soon as the hearing is
scheduled, the administrator must notify the claimant in writing of the date, time and place
of the hearing.
Giving notice involves more than merely stating the time, date and place of the hearing. The
notice should inform the claimant of the subject matter of the hearing. The administrator
should also explain the hearing procedure to the claimant; that the claimant will have a
chance to tell his/her side of the story; that the claimant may bring and question witnesses;
177
that the claimant and any witnesses for the claimant will be questioned; that both written and
oral evidence may be introduced at the hearing; and that the claimant may be represented by
legal counsel at his/her expense. Further, no information may be given or told to the FHA
that is not also available to the claimant. The administrator can give the FHA the case
record prior to the hearing, but cannot discuss the merits of the appeal with the FHA either
before or after the hearing until the FHA has issued its decision.
Claimant’s Failure to Appear
On occasion, the municipality will schedule a fair hearing, give written notice to all the
parties, and then the claimant fails to come to the hearing. If the party who requests the
hearing fails to appear, the FHA should convene the hearing, note for the record that the
claimant failed to show up, and close the hearing. The FHA should send a written notice to
the claimant that it did not alter the administrator’s decision because no evidence was
introduced indicating it should be overturned. The notice shall indicate that the claimant has
five working days (per MMA’s sample GA ordinance) from receipt of the notice to submit to
the Administrator information demonstrating “just cause” for failure to appear. The
following are examples of circumstances which may constitute just cause:
? A death or serious illness in the family;
? A personal illness which reasonably prevents the party from attending the hearing;
? An emergency or unforeseen event which reasonably prevents the party from attending
the hearing;
? An obligation or responsibility which a reasonable person in the conduct of his or her
affairs could reasonably conclude takes precedence over the attendance at the hearing;
? Lack of receipt of adequate or timely notice;
? Excusable neglect, excusable inadvertence, or excusable mistake.
If a claimant establishes just cause within five working days, the request for the hearing will
be reinstated and a hearing rescheduled.
If the claimant does not appear for the hearing but his/her attorney does, the FHA should
proceed with the hearing. Should the attorney introduce information demonstrating “just
cause” for his/her client’s failure to appear then the hearing should be recessed until another
day.
178
In the event a claimant who is represented by legal counsel fails to appear at a fair hearing,
legal counsel should not be allowed to testify in place of the claimant on matters of “fact”
but may cross examine witnesses and make “legal” arguments on behalf of the claimant.
Withdrawing a Request for a Fair Hearing
Once a GA administrator receives a request for a fair hearing, the administrator must act
upon it. If a claimant who has filed a request for a hearing decides that he/she doesn’t want
to go ahead with it, the claimant may stop the hearing only by presenting a written
notification to the administrator that he or she wants to withdraw the request for a hearing. If
an administrator receives such a notification, it should be entered in the claimant’s case file,
noted in the narrative record, and no further action need be taken.
The Fair Hearing Authority
Every municipality must appoint a Fair Hearing Authority to hear appeals of decisions made
by the GA administrator. According to the law (22 M.R.S.A. § 4322), the Fair Hearing
Authority may take one of three forms. It may be:
1. one or more municipal officers, provided those municipal officers had absolutely no
involvement with the GA decision or appeal;
2. the Board of Appeals (created in accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2691), if authorized
by the municipal officers; or
3. one or more persons appointed by the municipal officers to act as the FHA.
As an aside, although municipalities may choose any of the above forms of FHA, there exist
practical considerations, which favor the last alternative, “one or more persons” form of
FHA. Municipalities seeking the least administratively burdensome form, one which may
promote a greater sense of “fairness” for the GA client and one which minimizes the risks
involved in breach of confidentiality, should consider the third alternative.
Regardless of the form of FHA a municipality chooses, the essential quality of the FHA is
fairness. Under no circumstances may any person who played any part in the grant or denial
of GA to the claimant serve as the Fair Hearing Authority.
If, for instance, the first selectman serves as the general assistance administrator, that
selectman may not serve as a member of the FHA. If the administrator discusses a case with
someone, that person may not serve on the FHA if that case is appealed.
179
There are several qualities the members of the FHA must have, but above all the FHA must
be impartial. The FHA must be well acquainted with the state law and the ordinance. The
FHA must be capable of evaluating all evidence that comes before it in a fair and impartial
manner.
Duties of the Fair Hearing Authority
Before holding a fair hearing, it is important for the FHA to know and understand its
responsibilities. The FHA must not “rubber stamp” the administrator’s decision. The FHA
must determine the claimant’s eligibility independently of the administrator’s decision.
Carson v. Town of Oakland, 442 A.2d 170 (Me. 1982). A Fair Hearing is an administrative
proceeding known as a de novo hearing which is Latin for anew or afresh. This means that
the FHA must determine the claimant’s eligibility as if no decision had been made by the
administrator. The FHA must consider if the claimant was eligible for assistance at the time
he or she applied, based solely on the information and evidence presented at the Fair
Hearing.
It should be emphasized that the Fair Hearing Authority is an administrative review body
that functions without the technical rules of evidence, but it is still subject to the
requirements of due process. Although the hearing may be conducted less formally than a
court hearing, the FHA is responsible for protecting the claimant’s individual rights and
liberties under the law.
The hearing must be held in private unless the claimant has given express, written consent to
hold the hearing in public. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4322. The only persons authorized to attend the
hearing are the FHA, the claimant, the GA administrator, legal representatives, witnesses,
and a clerk or stenographer to transcribe the hearing proceedings.
In addition to its duty to be impartial and fair, the FHA also has some procedural duties of
which it must be aware. The FHA has the duty to:
1. open the hearing, explain the purpose of the hearing and the rules of conduct;
2. direct the course of the hearing, making sure it is conducted in an orderly fashion,
keeping the testimony to the case at hand, and allowing all sides to present their facts
and witnesses;
3. administer oaths to people who testify;
180
4. hear all testimony and accept evidence which is germane and will help to render a
decision;
5. close the hearing after all parties have been satisfied that all evidence has been
presented;
6. make a fair decision that is written and given to the applicant within 5 working days
after the hearing. 22 M.R.S.A. § 4322.
In order to help the FHA prepare for the hearing it may need certain information prior to the
hearing. The FHA should be told what the issues to be decided are. The Administrator and
the claimant may give the FHA useful information prior to the hearing, provided that the
other party is notified and the information is made available to the other party. For instance,
the Administrator may give the FHA a copy of the claimant’s application, budget sheet
decision and request for a hearing. The claimant might give the FHA a doctor’s statement
verifying a disability, or copies of bills.
State law requires municipalities to make a taped record of the Fair Hearing. 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4322. Recording the hearing is important to help the FHA make its decision, but also to
help substantiate the municipality’s case if the claimant appeals the FHA’s decision to the
Superior Court, or eventually, the Supreme Court. Claimants must provide (i.e., pay for) a
transcript of the taped record if they decide to appeal the decision to the Superior Court.
Fair Hearing Decision
The Fair Hearing Authority’s decision must be made within five working days. 22 M.R.S.A
§ 4322. The FHA must take into account the law, the local ordinance, and all the
information presented at the hearing, while reaching its decision. The decision must be made
in accordance with the ordinance in effect at the time the administrator made the decision.
The ordinance may not be changed in the course of the FHA’s deliberations.
The written decision must state explicitly the reasons for the FHA’s action. It should state
the reason for the hearing, the issues at appeal, the relevant facts discussed, and the decision
and the reason for it, citing the pertinent provisions of the law and the ordinance. The
decision must also include a section informing the claimant that he or she has the right to
appeal the decision to the Superior Court within 30 days of receiving the decision.
22 M.R.S.A. § 4322. The decision of the Fair Hearing Authority is binding upon the
administrator.
181
Copies of the decision must be given to the claimant and the GA administrator and kept in
the claimant’s file.

Exhibit 1
185
GA Fair Hearings “A Checklist”
Applicant requests General Assistance (i.e., fills out appropriate application, etc.)
1st
The Written Decision
? GA administrator provides applicant with the written decision (notice of eligibility/
ineligibility) either:
? by hand;
? by certified mail, return receipt requested (legally sufficient and provides proof of
receipt by applicant—if applicant accepts the certified packet); or
? by regular mail (legally sufficient, but difficult to prove actual receipt by applicant)
Note: In difficult cases the GA administrator may decide to mail the applicant/recipient the
decision both by regular mail and certified mail, return receipt requested. The GA decision
or notification should contain the local hearing procedure for requesting the hearing (see
Exhibits 2 & 3 for sample “Notices of Eligibility/Ineligibility”).
2nd
The Request for Appeal
? Applicant provides town with a written request for an appeal within 5 days of receipt of
the written notification of eligibility/ineligibility (see Exhibit 4 for a sample “Request
for a Fair Hearing”).
Note: It is difficult, if not impossible, to assert the timeliness rule if the town does not have
proof of receipt of the decision by the applicant. Moreover, the 5-day window provided to
the applicant turns into 10-days for “any other act or failure to act” by the GA
administrator. For example, this extension would typically apply when the town issues no
decision after a GA application has been submitted.
? If “yes” to all of the above, proceed with Fair Hearing request.
? If “no” to the above, does applicant have “just cause” for the delay in requesting the
appeal (i.e., given a set of factual circumstances it would be unreasonable to expect the
Exhibit 1
186
applicant to possess the ability/wherewithal to appeal in a timely manner).
Note: Should “just cause” exist, the town may choose to waive the timeliness issue.
However, it is ultimately up to the FHA to decide on the matter or reject the appeal on the
grounds of timeliness.
3rd
5-Day Time Frame
? ”Just cause” is not found to exist, and the applicant has missed the 5-day time frame.
The applicant reapplies for general assistance. Is there new information giving the
applicant reason to reapply?
? If yes, proceed with the reapplication.
? If not (applicant’s situation has not changed), nor is there a need for emergency
assistance, then allow the appeal to proceed. During fair hearing assert the time bar issue
and the FHA should find the applicant was not timely.
Note: If applicant reapplies due to a change in financial situation (i.e., loss of income,
household size changed, expenses changed or, emergency developed, etc.), then
reapplication process should take place. Remember that reapplication comes with a new
right to a fair hearing!
4th
Proceeding with the Hearing
? It is determined that the fair hearing process should proceed. Has the GA administrator:
? Reviewed the pertinent statutes/DHHS policy/ordinance (or, called DHHS/MMA) in
order to review decision;
? Spoken to the applicant to ascertain that applicant understands the reason for the
decision;
? Informed the applicant that he/she will be receiving a “Notice of Fair Hearing” with the
date, time, and place of hearing, within a day or two.
Exhibit 1
187
5th
Contacting the FHA
? Contact FHA and set up a date, place and time for the hearing. If appropriate, inform
FHA that you are sending pertinent parts of case record, etc.
Note: Absolutely do not discuss the case with the FHA. This sort of communication is
considered an ex parte communication and is strictly prohibited!
6th
Notification of Fair Hearing
? Send complainant notification of hearing that includes date, place and time of hearing.
In addition, notice should also state complainant’s rights (e.g., right to bring witnesses,
cross examine witnesses and be represented by an attorney at their own expense) (see
Exhibit 5 for a sample “Notice of Fair Hearing”).
7th
Submitting Case Record
? Send FHA and applicant (now a complainant) pertinent parts of the case file (as
necessary and/or appropriate).
Note: Whatever information FHA receives (whether during or, prior to the hearing) the
complainant must also receive!
8th
Prepare For Hearing
? Prepare for hearing i.e., write memorandum/brief (see Exhibit 9 for sample
“Memorandum”).
9th
Holding Hearing
? FHA holds hearing. (See Exhibit 7 of this packet for a sample script to follow.)
10th
Decision in 5-Days
? Remind FHA to issue a written decision within 5 working days of the hearing (see
Exhibit 5 for a sample “Notice of Fair Hearing Decision”).
Exhibit 1
188
Note: Again, absolutely do not discuss the case with the FHA. This sort of communication
is considered an ex parte communication and is strictly prohibited!
11th
Follow FHA’s Decision
? Upon receipt of FHA’s decision, follow the FHA’s directions exactly regardless of the
decision.
12th
Appeal of FHA’s Decision
? Does either party want to appeal the FHA decision? Either party can appeal the decision
within 30 days of the receipt of the fair hearing decision, in Superior Court, pursuant to
Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80-B.
Note: This is a costly option and the party considering appeal will require an attorney.
Municipal officers may need to approve this expenditure of funds for legal representation.
Bottom line-make, certain the issue is worth appealing.

2-6
the purpose of eliminating violations of this Ordinance and recovering fines without Court

is clear and convincing evidence that the illegal structure or use was constructed or
conducted as a direct result of erroneous advice given by an authorized municipal official
and there is no evidence that the owner acted in bad faith, or unless the removal of the
structure or use will result in a threat or hazard to public health and safety or will result in
substantial environmental damage.

A. Districts Established
For the purpose of this Ordinance, the Town of Waldoboro is divided into the following districts:
Town-wide Districts Shoreland Districts (see Article 7)
Downtown Business District General Development I
Historic Village District General Development II
Limited Commercial Limited Residential
Industrial District Resource Protection
Residential District Stream Protection
Route 1 Commercial A District Commercial Fisheries/Maritime Activities
Route 1 Commercial B District
Rural District
Rural Village Business District
Village District
Wellhead Overlay Protection District
B. Land Use and Shoreland Zoning Maps
The location and boundaries of the above districts are hereby established as shown on the map
entitled "Land Use Map of the Town of Waldoboro, Maine" approved by the voters June 16, 2005
and “Town of Waldoboro Shoreland Zoning Map” dated August 1, 2002, filed with the Town Clerk,
which Maps are hereby made part of this Ordinance.
Shoreland areas as defined in Article 7 are supplemental to the Town-wide districts listed in Section
A above and are subject to the provisions of Article 7 of this Ordinance, in addition to the provisions
of the district in which they are located.
The Official Land Use Maps shall be drawn at a scale of not less than: 1 inch = 2000 feet. District
boundaries shall be clearly delineated and a legend indicating the symbols for each district shall be
placed on the map.
C. Location and Authority of Land Use Map
The official Land Use Map shall be located in the Town Clerk's office and shall be the final authority
as to the current status of the land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the Town.
D. Uncertainty of District Boundaries
Land use district boundaries shown within the lines of roads, streams and transportation rights-ofway
shall be deemed to follow the center lines. When the Code Enforcement Officer cannot
definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such center lines, by the scale of
dimensions stated on the Land Use Map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line,
the Code Enforcement Officer shall refuse action, and the Board of Appeals, upon appeal, shall
interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Land Use Map and
the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this Ordinance.
ARTICLE 3. LAND USE DISTRICTS
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
3-2
E. Land Use Requirements.
Except as herein specified, no building, structure or land shall be used or occupied, and no building
or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, expanded, moved, or altered and no new
lot shall be created except in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in
which it is located, unless a variance is granted.
F. Purpose of Districts
1. Downtown Business District. The intent of the Downtown Business District is to protect the
downtown commercial area of Waldoboro by allowing commercial and residential uses in
existing buildings or in new buildings that are consistent with the architecture of a 19th
century New England village, as well as apartments, theaters, libraries, public uses and
parking lots. In order to encourage compact, urban-type development, there are no lot size
requirements.
2. Historic Village District. The purpose of the Historic Village District is to preserve the 19th
century character of the area in accordance with the 1998 Waldoboro Comprehensive Plan.
The intent is to allow residential use, home occupations and some businesses in existing or
new buildings consistent with the historic architecture.
3. Industrial District. The intent of the Industrial District is to allow light industry/ manufacturing
and heavy industry/manufacturing as defined.
4. Residential District. The purpose of the Residential District is to retain the rural character of
Waldoboro and to protect residential property values by allowing agriculture, forestry, home
occupations, and low density, single-family residential development. This district applies to
land areas on the water sides of Routes 32 and 220 south of Waldoboro Village, areas of
land within 400 feet of the landward side of Routes 32 and 220 south of Waldoboro Village
and areas of land within 250 feet of great ponds not otherwise zoned Resource Protection.
5. Route 1 Commercial A District. The intent of the Route 1 Commercial A District, which
applies to portions of Route 1, is to replace haphazard strip development with well-planned,
attractive, well-landscaped development, to encourage the retention of open space areas, to
require large setbacks from the edge of the road, and to minimize driveway openings onto
Route 1. The intent of this district is to allow mixed residential/commercial uses,
commercial uses, light industry/manufacturing, agricultural and forestry uses.
6. Route 1 Commercial B District. The intent of the Route 1 Commercial B District is to allow
business and light industry/manufacturing development along Route 1 with fewer
restrictions than in the Route 1 Commercial A District.
7. Rural District. The purpose of the Rural District is to retain the rural character of Waldoboro
by allowing agricultural, forestry, home occupations, and light industrial uses. Low-density
residential and related uses are permitted as consistent with the comprehensive plan. The
purpose of this district is primarily to prevent inappropriate development of land where there
are basically no public water and sewer utilities, and where the extension of such facilities is
not economically feasible, to minimize the municipal cost of providing services to remote
areas of the Town, to retain certain areas for non-intensive uses, and to retain areas for
open space, such as natural land surrounding water bodies or land suitable for support of
natural plant cover and wildlife, or land designated for recreational use. The intent of this
district is also to allow rural-area commercial uses that may not be appropriate in other
districts including saw mills, forestry, and other agriculturally-related businesses.
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
3-3
Manufactured home parks are permitted only within a two (2) mile radius of the intersection
of Jefferson Street and U.S. Route 1.
8. Rural Village Business District. The intent of the Rural Village Business District is to
encourage small scale, residentially compatible business activities in Waldoboro’s historic
rural crossroad neighborhoods.
9. Village District. The purpose of the Village District is to retain and protect the character of
Waldoboro Village, exclusive of the Downtown Business District and the Historic Village
District, and to provide for future growth consistent with current land development patterns.
The intent is to allow single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, home occupations, multifamily
dwellings, municipal and institutional uses, churches, libraries and schools with
minimum lot sizes ranging from 5,000 square feet to 80,000 square feet depending upon the
availability of public water and sewer services.
10. Wellhead Overlay Protection District. The purpose of the Wellhead Overlay Protection
District is to protect the public water supply in Waldoboro from land uses that pose a threat
to the quality and/or quantity of ground water being extracted from the wells that serve the
public water system.
The Overlay District imposes performance standards over, and in addition to, those required
in the underlying district. All land uses permitted in the underlying districts shall be subject
to the conditions, standards, and review requirements contained in Article 12, Wellhead
Protection, of this Ordinance.
The Wellhead Overlay Protection District overlays portions of the following districts:
? Rural District
? Industrial District
? Rural Village District
? Stream Protection
? Limited Residential
? General Development
11. Shoreland Districts. The Shoreland Districts are intended to comply with the Mandatory
Shoreland Zoning, 38 M.R.S.A. § 435-449 (see Article 7).
a. General Development I District. The General Development I District includes the
following types of existing, intensively developed areas:
1) Mix of activities. Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres devoted to
commercial, industrial or intensive recreational activities, or a mix of such
activities, including, but not limited to, the following:
(a) Industrial activities. Areas devoted to manufacturing, fabricating or other
industrial activities;
(b) Commercial activities. Areas devoted to wholesaling, warehousing, retail

2) Patterns of uses. Areas otherwise discernible as having patterns of
intensive commercial, industrial or recreational uses.
b. General Development II District. The General Development II District includes the
same types of areas as those listed for the General Development I District. The
General Development II District, however, shall be applied to newly established
General Development Districts where the pattern of development at the time of
adoption is undeveloped or not as intensively developed as that of the General
Development I District.
Portions of General Development Districts I or II may also include residential
development. However, no area shall be designated as a General Development I or
II District based solely on residential use.
In areas adjacent to great ponds and adjacent to rivers flowing to great ponds, the
designation of an area as a General Development District shall be based upon uses
existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance. There shall be no newly
established General Development Districts or expansions in area of existing General
Development Districts adjacent to great ponds, and adjacent to rivers that flow to
great ponds.
c. Limited Commercial District. The Limited Commercial District includes areas of
mixed, light commercial and residential uses excluding the Stream Protection
District, which should not be developed as intensively as the General Development
District. This district includes areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres in size
devoted to a mix of residential and low intensity business and commercial uses.
Industrial uses are prohibited.
d. Limited Residential District. The Limited Residential District includes those areas
suitable for residential and recreational development. It includes areas other than
those in the Resource Protection District, or Stream Protection District, and areas
which are used less intensively than those in the Limited Commercial District, the
General Development Districts, or the Commercial Fisheries /Maritime Activities
District.
e. Resource Protection District. The Resource Protection District includes areas in
which development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat,
biological ecosystems, or scenic and natural values. This district shall include the
following areas when they occur within the limits of the Shoreland Zone exclusive of
the Stream Protection District, except that areas which are currently developed and
areas which meet the criteria for the Limited Commercial, General Development,
or Water-dependent Commercial Maritime Activities Districts need not be included
within the Resource Protection District:
1) Wildlife habitat. Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland
edge of freshwater wetlands, salt marshes and salt meadows, and wetlands
associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated "moderate" or "high"
value by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W),
that are depicted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer
maintained by either MDIF&W or the Department as of May 1, 2006. For the
purposes of this paragraph “wetlands associated with great ponds and
rivers” shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation
and hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond or river, and have a
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
3-5
surface elevation at or below the water level of the great pond or river during
the period of normal high water. “Wetlands associated with great ponds or
rivers” are considered to be part of that great pond or river. Wetlands rated
as “moderate” or “high” value wildlife habitat by the Maine Department of
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife by document entitled Conservation of Inland
Fisheries and Wildlife Habitat, based on a wetlands inventory and
assessment completed in 2006 by MDIF&W, include the wetlands listed
below.

Other Dimensional Requirements:
1. For multiple commercial uses, 80,000 square feet and 400 feet of road frontage and 100 feet setback for each
use provided that developments which retain at least 50% of the frontage and lot area as open space and
provide shared driveways no closer than 600 feet apart and/or a frontage road, the lot size is 80,000 square feet
for the first use and 10,000 square feet for each additional use, the frontage is 400 feet for the first use and 50
feet for each additional use, and all buildings are set back at least 100 feet from the edge of the traveled way, but
not within the right-of-way.
2. Lots for some utility installations such as pump lifts, transformer yards, telephone relays, etc. do not have to meet
the minimum lot size.
3. Road setback is measured from the edge of the traveled way, but not within the right-of-way.
4. The minimum lot size requirement shall be met for each dwelling unit located on a parcel of land with the
following exception: a duplex shall be subject to the same minimum lot size requirement as a single-family
dwelling. By way of illustration, in the Rural District a single family dwelling would require 80,000 square feet, a
duplex would require 80,000 square feet, and two separate dwellings would require 160,000 square feet. Each
separate dwelling on a single lot requires the net developable acreage as required by this Ordinance.
5. The minimum road setback of principal structures in the Rural Village, Village, and Historic Village Districts
where buildings have traditionally been sited closer to the road may be reduced to the average road setback of
existing principal buildings located within 500 feet and which front on the same road.
6. Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance, where no other feasible alternative exists, a handicapped
ramp may be added to an existing building closer than the required setbacks, provided that the applicant is a
disabled person, that the property is to be used by persons with disabilities, as defined by the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA); or that the property is a place of “public accommodation”; and that the design of the
access structure conforms with ADA guidelines.

A. Air & Water Pollution
Will not result in undue water or air pollution on and off site.
1. In making this determination the Planning Board shall at least consider: the elevation of land
above sea level and its relation to flood plains; the nature of soils and subsoils and their
ability to adequately support waste disposal; the slope of the land and its effect on effluents;
the availability of streams for disposal of effluents; and the applicable state and local health
and waste water resources rules and regulations.
2. No emission of dust, ash, smoke or other particulate matter or gasses and chemicals shall
be allowed which can cause damage to human or animal health, vegetation, or property by
reason of concentration or toxicity, which can cause soiling beyond the property boundaries,
or which fails to meet or cannot meet the standards set by the Maine Department of
Environmental Protection.
B. Buffer Areas
No industrial or commercial buildings or uses shall be established in, or about, a residential use,
unless a landscaped buffer strip is provided to visually screen the uses. Where no natural
vegetation can be maintained due to varying site conditions, the landscaping may consist of fences,
walls, tree plantings, hedges or combinations thereof. The buffering shall be sufficient to minimize
the impacts of any kind of potential use such as: loading and unloading operations, outdoor storage
areas, commercial boat storage, vehicle parking, mineral extraction, waste collection, and disposal
areas. Where a potential safety hazard to small children would exist, physical screening/barriers
shall be used to deter entry to such premises. The buffer areas shall be maintained and vegetation
replaced to ensure continuous year round screening.
The following standards apply to buffer strips, screening and landscaping required under this
Ordinance:
1. Buffer strips. Buffer strips shall be required of the following widths for the following areas
and/or purposes:
a. Protect water bodies. Along any water body within or adjacent to the project where
the Planning Board determines it desirable and necessary to protect such water
bodies from sedimentation and pollution: Such buffer strips shall be a minimum of
seventy-five (75) feet in width or such greater width which in the judgment of the
Planning Board may be necessary to protect water bodies from sedimentation and
pollution.
b. Buffer strip on adjacent lot. If there is a buffer strip on the adjacent lot and the
applicant for Site Plan Approval provides the Planning Board with some form of
guarantee from the abutter acceptable to the Board that the adjoining buffer strip will
remain undeveloped, the Planning Board may reduce the required buffer strip by the
width of the encumbered adjoining buffer strip.
c. Route 1 buffer. A vegetative buffer, 15 feet deep, as measured from the front
ARTICLE 4. GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
4-2
property line, shall be provided along Route 1 for all new commercial developments
and for the redevelopment of existing commercial properties. Parking shall be
prohibited within this buffer strip.
d. Incompatible uses. Along any property line, where the Planning Board determines
the adjacent uses are incompatible, to shield incompatible uses from one another.
Such buffer strips shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet in width and such
additional width which in the judgment of the Planning Board may be necessary to
shield incompatible uses from ordinary view. In determining incompatible uses, the
Planning Board shall consider whether the intensity of uses on the site in question
would cause an undue loss of “quiet enjoyment” upon an adjacent property.
e. Visual impacts. Along any property line, where the Planning Board determines it
desirable to minimize the visual impact on adjoining traveled ways and properties of
uses including, but not limited to, the following: exposed storage and service areas,
sand and gravel extraction operations, utility buildings and structures, automobile
salvage and junkyards, parking areas, garbage collection areas, and loading and
unloading areas. Such buffer strips shall be consistent with setback requirements.
f. Buffering of residential uses. Any lot within the Urban Compact line (see Appendix
A) of the community that is used for nonresidential or multifamily residential
purposes shall have a landscaped buffer on any property line that abuts a residential
use or residentially zoned lot. The width of the buffer may vary depending on the
treatment of the area. A buffer with dense planting, fencing, or changes in grade
may be as little as five (5) feet in width. A buffer with moderate levels of planting
should be ten (10) feet to fifteen (15) feet in width.
In all residential settings, the width of the vegetated buffer should be increased to a
minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. Areas adjacent to service, loading or storage areas
should be screened by dense planting, berms or a combination thereof.
2. Screening. Screening within the required buffer strips, in the form of natural or man-made
barriers, existing vegetation or new plantings, if suitable existing vegetation and natural
features do not exist, is required as follows:
a. Natural features. Natural features in buffer strips shall be maintained wherever
possible. When natural features such as topography, gullies, stands of trees,
shrubbery, and/or rock outcrops do not exist or are insufficient to screen structures
and uses from the view of abutting properties and, where applicable, public
roadways, other types of buffers shall be provided to supplement the existing
features.
b. Vegetation variety. All buffers that contain vegetation shall provide for a variety and
mixture of landscaping. The variety shall be based on a consideration of
susceptibility to disease, hardiness for specific site location, colors, season,
textures, shapes, sizes, blossoms and foliage. Planted vegetation shall take the
form of shade trees, deciduous shrubs, evergreens, well-kept grassed areas or
ground cover, the species of which shall be well-suited to the Waldoboro area and
approved by the Planning Board.
c. Vegetation standards. Where planting is required, as determined by the Planning
Board, at least one (1) shade tree at least six (6) feet in height and at least two and
a half (2 ½) to three (3) inches in diameter, measured at a point four (4) feet above
finished grade level, shall be planted no nearer than five (5) feet to any lot line for
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
4-3
each three hundred (300) square feet of required landscaped area; and at least one
(1) deciduous shrub or evergreen at least eighteen (18) inches above finished grade
level, shall be planted for each two hundred (200) square feet of finished
landscaped area.
d. Fencing. Where fencing is provided, it shall be no more than six (6) feet in height,
and shall be so located within the property line to allow access for maintenance on
both sides without intruding upon abutting properties, except that the Planning
Board may require up to an eight (8) foot high fence to separate incompatible uses.
3. Maintenance of the Buffer Areas
a. Maintenance. All landscaped buffer areas shall be maintained in a healthy, neat
and attractive condition by the owner. Maintenance shall include, but not be limited
to, watering, fertilizing, weeding, cleaning, pruning, trimming, spraying and
cultivating.
b. Replacements. Vegetation which dies shall be replaced as quickly as possible and
within one (1) growing season. Replacement plantings shall conform to the original
intent of the landscape design.
4. Landscaping
The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as practical, by minimizing tree
removal and grade changes. Landscaping shall be designed to soften, screen, or enhance
the physical design of structures and parking areas to avoid the encroachment of the
proposed use on abutting land uses. All parking lots shall be landscaped along the property
boundaries with shrubbery, trees, and other landscape materials. Parking lots shall provide
a two and one-half inch (2½”) caliper shade tree per twenty (20) parking spaces (six (6)
trees per acre) located throughout the lot.

K. Phosphorus Control
The introduction of excessive amounts of phosphorus into lakes and ponds has been identified as a
significant threat to water quality. The long-term effects of the proposed development will not
unreasonably increase a great pond’s phosphorus concentration during the construction phase and
life of the proposed development. The following provisions are applicable to all projects requiring
site plan or subdivision review that are located within the watershed of a great pond.
1. For all new principal structures, expansions of existing structures which increase the floor
area by 30% or more over the lifetime of the structure, new accessory structures of 300
square feet or more and new or enlarged roads and driveways of 300 square feet or more
on lots, phosphorus export from such development shall be equal to or less than that which
is calculated using the methods established by the Maine Department of Environmental
Site Plan and Subdivision Review

produce a 1 part per billion (ppb) increase in the lake's phosphorus concentration (lbs./ppb/year)
b. Assumes 15% of each watershed is undevelopable due to environmental considerations; 30% of the
remaining acreage is likely to be developed over the next 50 years.
c. Amount of phosphorus each developed acre is allowed to export without violating water quality goals.
d. Drains to Sidensparker Pond
2. For all other accessory buildings, expansions of existing structures and expansions of
existing roads and driveways, the applicant shall demonstrate that, by utilizing permanent
vegetated buffers, limiting the clearing of vegetation and the size of the development area
limiting impervious surfaces and directing runoff away from the affected water body, the
potential for phosphorus export has been minimized.
3. For all developments which require a building permit, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Officer that the existing septic system is functioning
properly.
L. Refuse Disposal
The applicant shall provide for the disposal of all solid and liquid wastes on a timely basis and in a
manner provided for by federal and State law and this Ordinance. Will not cause an unreasonable
burden on the ability of a municipality to dispose of solid waste if municipal services are utilized. If
demolition debris, stumps, rocks, and brush are to be disposed of they shall be disposed on site if
possible. If they are disposed of at a municipal site, the costs of such disposal shall be paid for by
the developer.
The Planning Board shall consider the impact of particular industrial or chemical wastes or bySite
Plan and Subdivision Review
4-12
products upon the Town's facilities (in terms of volume, flammability or toxicity) and may require the
applicant to dispose of such wastes elsewhere, in conformance with all applicable State and federal
regulations. The Planning Board may require the applicant to specify the amount and exact nature
of all industrial or chemical and hazardous wastes to be generated by the proposed operation.
M. Sanitary Provisions
Will provide for adequate sewage disposal.
1. Adequate soils. When not serviced by the public sewerage system, the approval of building
permit applications shall be subject to presentation of a completed Maine Department of
Human Services Bureau of Health Engineering site evaluation form (HHE-200) which
evidences adequate soil conditions for subsurface wastewater disposal.
2. Common system. When two (2) or more lots or buildings in different ownership share a
common subsurface disposal system, the system shall be owned and maintained in
common by an owners' association. Covenants in the deeds for each lot shall require
mandatory membership in the association and provide for adequate funding of the
association to assure proper maintenance of the system.
3. Commercial or industrial waste. Industrial or commercial waste waters may be discharged to
municipal sewers only and in such quantities and/or of such quality as to be compatible with
municipal sewage treatment operations. Such wastes may require pretreatment at the
industrial or commercial site in order to render them amenable to municipal treatment
processes. Pretreatment includes, but is not limited to, screening, grinding, sedimentation,
pH adjustment, surface skimming, chemical oxidation and reduction and dilution. The
disposal of industrial or commercial waste waters by means other than the municipal
sewerage system shall comply with the laws of the State of Maine concerning water
pollution. Wash water or other process water carrying stone dust, stone particles, silt or
other mineral matter will not be accepted into the municipal system.
4. Medomak River discharges. Treated industrial waste discharges to the Medomak River
shall be prohibited above head of tide.
5. Municipal sewage disposal. If the development will use more than 33-1/3% of the available
excess capacity of any portion of the municipal sewerage collection system, treatment
facility, and/or discharge permits, the developer shall pay for the replacement of the
available excess capacity needed by the development.

addition of a third dwelling unit to a private driveway. A private drive serving three or more
residential lots or dwelling units shall be considered a street, and meet the standards in
table 14(i) below. The Code Enforcement Officer shall not issue a building permit for a third
dwelling unit served by a common drive until the drive is upgraded to road standards along
its entire length, to the point of, and including an emergency vehicle turn around, as
described in section 14.J. below. In the case of a residential Subdivision, a road
maintenance agreement prepared or approved by the town’s attorney and paid for by the
developer shall be recorded with the deed of each property to be served by a common
private road. The agreement shall provide for a method to initiate and finance a private
road, maintain the road in good condition, and a method of apportioning maintenance costs
to current and future users.
5. Access Location and Connectivity.
a. Avoidance of local streets. The vehicular access to any development shall be
arranged to avoid unnecessary traffic use of local residential streets.
b. Frontage on two (2) streets. Where a lot has frontage on two (2) or more streets, the
access to the lot shall be provided to the street where is lesser potential for traffic
congestions and for hazards to traffic and pedestrians.
c. Connections. Where topographic and other conditions allow, provision shall be
made for circulation driveway connections to adjoining lots of similar existing or
potential use:
1) Fire protection. When such driveway connection will facilitate fire protection
services as approved by the Fire Chief and/or
2) Adjacent uses. When such driveway will enable the public to travel between
two (2) existing or potential uses generally open to the public, without need
to travel upon a street.
6. Sight Distances. Access points shall be designed in profile and grading and located to
provide the required sight distance measured in each direction. Sight distances shall be
measured from the driver's seat of a vehicle standing on that portion of the exit lane with
the front of the vehicle a minimum of ten (10) feet behind the curb line or edge of shoulder,
with the height of the eye 3-1/2 feet, to the top of an object 4-1/2 feet above the pavement.
The required sight distances are listed below for various posted speed limits.
The sight distances provided below are based on passenger cars exiting from driveways or
roads onto two (2) lane roads and are designed to enable exiting vehicles:
a. Acceleration. Upon turning left or right, to accelerate to the operating speed of the
street without causing approaching vehicles to reduce speed by more than ten (10)
miles per hour; and;
b. Traffic clearance. Upon turning left, to clear the near half of the street without
conflicting with vehicles approaching from the left.

cannot be met, only a special case access shall be permitted. If based on the above
criteria, full access to the site cannot be provided on either the major or minor
streets, the site shall be restricted to partial access. Alternatively, construction of a
shared access with an adjacent parcel is recommended.
b. Access Spacing. Access points shall be separated from adjacent driveways and
property lines as indicated below, in order to allow major through routes to
effectively serve their primary arterial function of conducting through traffic. This
distance shall be measured from the access point of tangency to the access point of
tangency for spacing between access points and from the access point of tangency
to a projection of the property line at the edge of the roadway for spacing to the
property line.

S. Open Space Subdivisions
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-22
1. Introduction
a. Policy
It is the policy of the Town of Waldoboro to encourage the use of open space
subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space, provide for sustainable
agriculture and forestry as well as recreational land, preserve other resources
identified in the Town of Waldoboro Comprehensive Plan, and harmonize new
development with the traditional open, wooded, agricultural, rural and village
landscapes of the Town.
This performance standard is intended to implement that policy by providing
incentives that afford flexibility to landowners in road and lot layout and design and
road frontage requirements and by allowing the Planning Board to expedite
procedure and to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and
provisions of this Land Use Ordinance if such landowners commit to the permanent
preservation of important open space resources. These incentives are designed to
encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing and
environmental design for the development of single and multi-family residential
areas that will promote the most appropriate use of land and will preserve, as
permanent open space, agricultural or forestry land, important natural features,
wildlife habitat, water resources, ecological systems, and historic and scenic areas
for the benefit of present and future residents.
b. Purposes
To qualify as an open space subdivision, the Planning Board must find that the
subdivision will achieve all of the following purposes that are applicable to its
specific circumstances:
1) Long term protection and conservation of existing natural and other
resources and landscapes identified in the Comprehensive Plan and the
Land Use Ordinance, including but not limited to:
a) State-defined critical areas, and unique natural features located on
the parcel to be subdivided;
b) Historic land use patterns and historic structures;
c) Points of visual access to or from water bodies, scenic vistas, and
points of access to water bodies;
d) Contiguous stands of mature trees;
2) Maintenance or establishment of compatibility with surrounding land uses
and the overall rural character of the Town as defined by the Comprehensive
Plan;
3) Provision of adequate buffers for adjoining properties where needed;
4) Contribution to Town-wide open space planning by creating a system of
permanently preserved open space, both within large parcels of land and
among such parcels throughout the Town, and by encouraging linkages
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-23
between open space areas;
5) Conservation of land suitable or actively used for agriculture and forestry,
particularly where the open space subdivision borders active agricultural or
forest land or land suitable for the same;
6) Conservation of traditional land uses;
7) Creation of choices in the type of environment (business or residential) and
type of housing available that will be a long-term asset to Waldoboro;
8) Construction of affordable housing;
9) Provision of recreation facilities, including active and passive recreational
space, in the most suitable locations for use consistent with the other
purposes of this performance standard; and
10) Attainment of planned variety and coordination in the location of structures,
architectural styles, and building forms and relationships.
c. Types of Open Space Subdivisions
There are two types of open space subdivisions, which may be used separately or in
combination:
1) Cluster Subdivisions.
A cluster subdivision achieves the purposes of this performance standard by
reducing the lot size and frontage and setback requirements in the Land Use
Ordinance, modifying the road design standards contained in the
Subdivision Regulations, and clustering housing or business structures and
uses in those areas where they will have the least impact on identified
environmental and other open space resources. These resources are then
permanently preserved by the use of covenants and restrictions and/or
conservation easements that run with the land. The cluster principle can be
applied to subdivisions of any size.
2) Conservation Density Subdivisions
A conservation density subdivision achieves the purposes of this
performance standard through the creation of significantly lower lot densities
than what would be allowed in the applicable land use district. In no event
may the density of such a subdivision average less than ten (10) acres per
principal structure, including the land placed in open space for the parcel or
portion of the parcel to be developed. This low density is maintained in
perpetuity through the use of permanent conservation easements or
covenants and restrictions running with the land.
d. Grouping Contiguous Parcels
In order to increase design flexibility, two or more contiguous parcels of land under
the same or different ownership, including parcels separated by a public or private
road, may be grouped together as one open space subdivision, if the Planning
Board finds that such grouping will benefit the Town and that it helps achieve the
purposes set forth in Article 5 Section R.1.b.
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-24
2. Planning Board Review
a. Pre-application
An individual may test the feasibility of an open-space subdivision as part of the preapplication
conference described in Article 6 Section D.1.
b. Application Procedure
1) Required Plans
The submissions for an open space subdivision shall include, as appropriate
unless any of the same is waived, all plans and materials required for a
conventional subdivision.
2) Waiver of Submission and Review Requirements
The Planning Board may grant appropriate waivers of submission
requirements for an open space subdivision in order to expedite and make
the review process more efficient where the number of lots proposed for
development in a parcel is five or fewer within any five-year period, or the
proposed open space subdivision is a conservation density subdivision.
3. General Requirements
In Planning Board review and approval of an open space subdivision, the following
requirements shall apply and shall supersede any inconsistent or more restrictive provisions
of the Land Use Ordinance:
a. Use and District Requirements
All open space subdivisions shall meet the use standards of the districts in which
they are located.
b. Allowable Density
1) The allowable density for a proposed development of five or fewer lots within
any five-year period on a parcel of land under one ownership or a grouping
of contiguous parcels as described in Article 5 Section R.1.d. shall be
determined by the gross lot area of the portion of each parcel proposed for
development without reference to net residential acreage, divided by the
minimum lot size of the applicable district without reference to net residential
acreage.
2) The provisions for open space subdivisions may be applied to a
development consisting of a single lot where the purposes set forth in Article
5 Section R.1.b. will be served and which may provide effective long range
planning for a larger parcel of land than sought to be developed, when used
in conjunction with the flexible open space and substitution, timing, or
phasing provisions of this performance standard. In such cases, sufficient
open space to accommodate the single lot shall be permanently preserved
as set forth in Article 5 Section R.4., Open Space Requirements.
3) The allowable density for all other developments shall be based on net
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-25
residential density, and shall be calculated in the following manner:
a) Determine the buildable area of the parcel according to the definition
of "net developable area" contained in Article 4 Section H. and
reduce it by 20%; then
b) Divide the reduced net developable area by the minimum lot size
required in the district to obtain the net residential density allowable.
4) A lot for a dwelling unit created as part of an open space subdivision shall
not be further subdivided.
5) A lot for a principal structure created as part of an open space subdivision
where such lot shall have within its bounds designated open space shall not
be further subdivided unless the original approved plan shall have reserved
future development of such lot. Any such further subdivision shall only be
made in accordance with Article 5 Section R.
6) Any affordable housing density bonus provision provided for in the Land Use
Ordinance shall also apply within clustered residential projects.
7) In a conservation density subdivision, where all other requirements of Article
5 Section R are met, the Planning Board may include up to 50% of land in
Resource Protection zones and wetland areas for purposes of calculating
density.
c. Layout and Siting Standards
In planning the location and siting of residential or business structures in an open
space subdivision, lot dimension and frontage should not be the primary
considerations. Priority should be given to the preservation of the open space for its
natural resource value, with human habitation and business activity located and
sited on the lower valued natural resource portion of a parcel, taking into account
the contours of the land and the reasonableness of slopes.
The building lots on a parcel shall be laid out and the residences and business
structures shall be sited so as to maximize the following principles. The Board in its
discretion shall resolve conflicts between these principles as applied to a particular
site.
1) In the least suitable agricultural soils and in a manner which maximizes the
useable area remaining for the designated open space use, where existing
or future agricultural, forestry, or recreational uses are particularly sought to
be preserved.
2) In locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic, historic, and traditional
land use views, as seen from public roadways and great ponds.
3) Within woodlands or along the far edges of open agricultural fields adjacent
to any woodland, to reduce encroachment upon agricultural soils, to provide
shade in the summer and shelter as well as solar gain in the winter, and to
enable new residential development to be visually absorbed by natural
landscape features;
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-26
4) In such manner that the boundaries between residential or business lots and
active agricultural or forestry land are well buffered by vegetation,
topography, roads, or other barriers to minimize potential conflict between
residential or business and agricultural or forestry uses;
5) In locations where buildings may be oriented with respect to scenic vistas,
natural landscape features, topography, and natural drainage areas, in
accordance with an overall plan for site development;
6) In locations that provide compatibility in terms of physical size, visual impact,
intensity of use, proximity to other structures, and density of development
with other permitted uses within the land use district;
7) In locations such that diversity and originality in lot layout and individual
building, street, and parking layout is encouraged.
8) So that individual lots, buildings, street and parking areas shall be designed
and situated to minimize alterations of the natural site, to avoid the adverse
effects of shadows, noise and traffic on the residents of the site, to conserve
energy and natural resources, and to relate to surrounding properties, to
improve the view from and of buildings.
d. Space Standards
1) Shore frontage and shore setback requirements shall not be reduced below
the minimum shore frontage or shore setback required in the land use
district.
2) Distances between residential structures in multi-family open space
subdivisions shall be a minimum of the height of the tallest structure.
3) In areas outside of the shoreland zone, the required minimum lot size or
minimum land area per dwelling unit for the building envelope may be
reduced in open space subdivisions to no less than one-half acre. If the lot
area is reduced, the total open space in the development shall equal or
exceed the sum of the areas by which the building lots are reduced below
the minimum lot area normally required in the land use district as modified
by Article 5 Section R.3. b Allowable Density.
4) Minimum road frontage requirements of the Land Use Ordinance may be
waived or modified by the Planning Board provided that:
a) Any applicable provisions regarding roads in Article 4 Sections S and
T are satisfied.
b) Adequate access and turnaround to and from all parcels by fire
trucks, ambulances, police cars and other emergency vehicles can
be ensured by private roads and /or common driveways.
c) No common driveway shall provide access to more than three (3)
lots.
5) A reduction of required setback distances may be allowed at the discretion
of the Board, provided that the front, side and rear setbacks shall be no less
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-27
than twenty-five feet or that required for the applicable land use district,
whichever shall be less. For the perimeter of a multi-family cluster
development, site setback shall not be reduced below the minimum front,
side and rear setbacks required in the land use district unless the Planning
Board determines a more effective design of the project can better
accomplish the purposes of this performance standard.
e. Utilities
At the discretion of the Planning Board, in order to achieve the most appropriate
design and layout of lots and open space, utilities including individual wells and
septic systems may be located on designated portions of the open space, if
necessary, provided the same shall not unreasonably interfere with the open space
purposes to be achieved under this performance standard and for the particular
parcel(s) that is the subject of the application for open space subdivision.
1) The Planning Board may waive or modify hydrogeological reviews or
studies, if the applicant demonstrates that due to the specific placement of
wells and septic systems:
a) Adequate groundwater is available at all locations proposed for
individual water systems; and that
b) There is no reasonable likelihood that the domestic water supply for
any proposed lot will exceed 10mg/l of nitrates.
2) If a private central collection septic system is proposed for a single-family
clustered development or a multiplex cluster development, the applicant
must show that at least one (1) designated site for each lot, either in the
open space or on the lot, has adequate soils and land area suitable for
subsurface waste disposal for each lot in accordance with the minimum
standards set forth in the Maine State Plumbing Code, or that a second
designated site on the parcel has the size, location and soil characteristics to
accommodate a system similar to the one originally proposed.
3) If a private central collection system is proposed, the system shall be
maintained by a homeowners’ association or under an agreement of the lot
or unit owners in the same fashion required for maintenance of the open
space by a homeowners’ association or the lot or unit owners in common,
and written evidence of said maintenance agreement shall be submitted to
the Planning Board.
4. Open Space Requirements
In Planning Board review and approval of an open space subdivision, the following
requirements shall apply and shall supersede any inconsistent or more restrictive provisions
of this Land Use Ordinance or the Subdivision Regulations.
Open space set aside in an open space subdivision shall be permanently preserved as
required by this performance standard, except as allowed under this provision for flexible
open space and the substitution for and/or the addition to the same. Land set aside as
permanent open space may, but need not, be a separate tax parcel. Such land may be
included as a portion of one or more large parcels on which dwellings are permitted,
provided that a conservation easement or a declaration of covenants and restrictions is
placed on such land pursuant to Article 5 Section R.4.c., Preservation in Perpetuity, and
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-28
provided that the Planning Board approves such configuration of the open space.
a. Open Space Uses
On all parcels, open space uses shall be appropriate to the site. Open space shall
include natural features located on the parcel(s) such as, but not limited to, stream
beds, significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, agricultural land,
forested acreage, wildlife habitat, rock outcroppings and historic features and sites.
Open space shall be preserved and maintained subject to the following, as
applicable:
1) On parcels that contain significant portions of land suited to agricultural
production, open space shall be conserved for agriculture or other consistent
open space uses such as forestry, recreation (active or passive), and
resource conservation.
2) When the principal purposes of conserving portions of the open space is the
protection of natural resources such as wetlands, aquifers, steep slopes,
wildlife and plant habitats, and stream corridors, open space uses in those
portions may be limited to those which are no more intensive than passive
recreation.
3) Open space areas shall be contiguous, where possible, to allow linking of
open space areas throughout the Town.
4) If the open space is to be devoted at least in part to a productive land use,
such as agriculture or forestry, the developer shall submit to the Planning
Board a plan of how such use is to be fostered in the future. Such plan may
include, for example, a long-term timber management plan.
5) The Planning Board may limit the use of any open space at the time of final
plan approval where the Board deems it necessary to protect adjacent
properties or uses, or to protect sensitive natural features or resources. A
proposed change in use of open space land, other than that specified at the
time of plan approval, shall be reviewed by the Planning Board as an
amendment to the approved plan.
6) Further subdivision of open space or its use for other than agriculture,
forestry, recreation or conservation, except for easements for underground
utilities, shall be prohibited and shall be so stated by deed restrictions except
as provided in Article 5 Section R.4.c. Structures and buildings accessory to
agriculture, recreation or conservation uses may be erected on open space,
subject to Planning Board approval under Article 6 of the Land Use
Ordinance and the provisions for open space subdivisions.
b. Notations on Plan
Open space must be clearly labeled on the Final Plan to show ownership,
management, responsibility for maintenance, method of preservation, permitted
uses and the portions of the open space to which such uses apply, and the rights, if
any, of the owners in the subdivision to such land or portions thereof. The Plan shall
clearly show that the open space land is permanently reserved for open space
purposes, is subject to a reservation for future development, including those
provisions allowed under Article 5 Sections R.4.e and f. and shall contain a notation
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-29
indicating the book and page of any conservation easements or deed restrictions
required to be recorded to implement such reservations or restrictions.
c. Preservation in Perpetuity
An owner of a parcel of land may designate all or a portion of the parcel for open
space use in perpetuity if the purposes set forth in Article 5 Section R.1.b. are
achieved and all other requirements of this performance standard are met, subject
to the following conditions:
1) A perpetual conservation easement or declaration of covenants and
restrictions restricting development of the open space land must be
incorporated in the open space plan.
2) The conservation easement may be granted to or the declarations may be
for the benefit of a private party, third party or other entity, the Town, with the
approval of the Board of Selectmen, or to a qualified not-for-profit
conservation organization acceptable to the Planning Board.
3) Such conservation easement or declaration of covenants and restrictions
shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board and be required as a
condition of plan approval hereunder.
4) The Planning Board may require that such conservation easement, or
declaration of covenants and restrictions, be enforceable by the Town of
Waldoboro if the Town is not the holder of the conservation easement or
beneficiary of the declarations.
5) The conservation easement or declarations shall prohibit residential,
industrial, or commercial use of such open space land (except in connection
with agriculture, forestry, and recreation), and shall not be amendable to
permit such use.
6) The conservation easement or declarations shall be recorded in the Lincoln
County Registry of Deeds prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the
Open Space Subdivision final plan in the Lincoln County Registry of Deeds.
7) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conservation easement, or the
declaration of covenants and restrictions, may allow dwellings to be
constructed on portions of parcels that include protected open space land,
provided that:
a) The total number of dwellings permitted by the conservation
easement, or declaration of covenants and restrictions, in the entire
subdivision does not exceed the allowable density established in this
performance standard above;
b) The Planning Board grants approval for such lots; and,
c) The applicant has reserved the right to apply for approval for such
additional lots.
d. Ownership of Open Space Land
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-30
Open space land may be held in private ownership (which is to be preferred)
including an appropriate third party not the applicant; or owned in common by a
homeowners’ association (HOA); dedicated to the Town, county or State
governments or agencies; transferred to a non-profit organization such as a
conservation trust or association acceptable to the Planning Board; or held in such
other form of ownership as the Planning Board finds adequate to achieve the
purposes set forth in Article 5 Section R.1.b. and under the other requirements of
this Land Use Ordinance.
The appropriate form of ownership shall be determined based upon the purpose of
the open space reservation as stated pursuant to Article 5 Section R Q.4.a. above.
Unless so determined, or unless deeded to the Town of Waldoboro and accepted by
the citizens of the Town at Town Meeting, common open space shall be owned in
common by the owners of the lots or units in the development. Covenants for
mandatory membership in the association setting forth the owners' rights and
interest and privileges in the association and the common land shall be included in
the deed for each lot. Ownership of the open space land shall be indicated on the
final subdivision plan.
e. Flexible Open Space and Substitution; Phasing
An applicant for an open space subdivision may at a future time designate other
land to serve as the open space for such subdivision if the Planning Board finds that
the purposes set forth in Article 5 Section R.1.b. will better be served by promoting a
more innovative design and layout of lots created over time in relation to the area(s)
designated as open space if all other requirements under this performance standard
may be met and such substitution is specifically allowed in any documentation
associated with the open space, conservation easement, or homeowners’
association. Development that is phased over time, including a schedule over time
for either sale of lots or layout of further lots as part of the open space subdivision
plan, is encouraged so that more appropriate design of land use and preservation of
greater open space may be achieved.
f. Maintenance Standards
Maintenance standards for open space land, where appropriate, shall be in
accordance with other requirements of this Land Use Ordinance.
T. Recreational Facilities
All recreation facilities shall meet the provisions below:
1. Parking. There shall be provided adequate off-street parking for the anticipated maximum
attendance at any event.
2. Rubbish facilities. Containers and facilities for rubbish collection and removal shall be
provided.
3. Screening. Adequate screening, buffer area, or landscape provisions shall be built, planted,

practical extent.
Y. Small Wind Energy Regulations
1. Intent of this Section: The Town of Waldoboro regulates the placement and construction of
Small Wind Energy Systems in order to promote their safe and efficient use. These
regulations are meant to encourage the Town’s government, residences, small businesses,
home occupations, and farms to use Small Wind Energy Systems, which reduce on-site
demand for utility-supplied electricity and increase consumer energy independence and the
demand for a non-polluting source of energy. The regulations are also intended to minimize
the visual, environmental and operational impacts of Small Wind Energy Systems on the
Town and its residents.
2. Definitions. The following definitions govern this section:
a. “AWEA” means the American Wind Energy Association
b. “Diameter” means the cross sectional dimension of the circle swept by the rotating
blades or helix or other rotating or moving component of the Small Wind Energy
System.
c. "Small Wind Energy System" means a wind energy conversion system consisting of
a wind turbine, air foils of various shape or size, a tower (or appropriate attachment
to, or inclusion within a building) and all of its related components and associated
control or conversion electronics, which has a rated capacity that does not exceed
100 kilowatts. A single Small Wind Energy System may serve more than one lot,
residence, home occupation, farm or small business.
d. “System Height” means the height above grade to the tip of the Small Wind Energy
System when it reaches its highest elevation when in operation.
e. “Tower” means, with regard to a Small Wind Energy System, the structure on which
the Small Wind Energy System is mounted. This includes a monopole, or a
freestanding or guyed structure that supports a Small Wind Energy System.
k. "Tower Height" means the height above grade of the fixed portion of the Tower,
excluding the wind turbine and air foils.
3. Permit Required. In addition to the procedures set forth in Article 2.C. of this Ordinance,
the following permitting procedures shall apply:
a. Notice to Abutters. Notice of an application for installation of a Small Wind Energy
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-35
System shall be provided by regular US mail by the Town to property owners whose
property line is within 1000 feet of the site of the proposed Small Wind Energy
System. Responses to the notice shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer
no later than 20 days from the date of notice. The Code Enforcement Officer may
request that the Planning Board call a public hearing concerning the application if
responses from abutters indicate that a public hearing, in the discretion of the Code
Enforcement Officer, is either necessary or advisable.
b. Public Notice. The Code Enforcement Officer may, if he or she deems it necessary
due to circumstances specific to the proposed installation, provide notice of the
application by placing a display advertisement in at least one newspaper of general
circulation. The applicant shall pay the cost of the display advertisement. The Code
Enforcement Officer may request the Planning Board to call a public hearing
concerning the application if responses to the public notice indicate that a public
hearing, in the discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer, is either necessary or
advisable.
c. Modifications. Any modifications to a previously permitted installation must receive
the review and approval of the Code Enforcement Officer.
4. Schedule of Dimensional Requirements.
a. The permit applicant shall provide evidence that the proposed Tower Height does
not exceed the tower height recommended by the manufacturer or distributor of the
system.
b. Small Wind Energy System Tower Heights of not more than 80 feet may be allowed
on parcels of one acre or less;
c. Small Wind Energy Systems on parcels of more than one acre may be allowed to
accommodate Tower Heights of up to 90 feet.
d. In determining allowances for tower heights, consideration shall be given to the
heights of surrounding trees, to existing wind corridors and to the proximity of
buildings on abutters’ and the permit applicant’s properties.
e. The Tower shall be set back from the property line at least 100% of the System
Height, except that guy wire anchors may extend to the property boundary.
f. Consideration shall be given to Restrictive Small Wind Energy System Easements
on abutting parcels to satisfy acreage and setback requirements. If a Wind
Easement and/or Restrictive Small Wind Energy System Easement has been
obtained or granted to the owner of the proposed Small Wind Energy System,
setback may be measured from the extent of the easement boundary (see #10 of
this section)
g. Blade Clearance. For horizontal axis wind turbines, the minimum distance between
the ground and any protruding propeller blades shall be not less than 15 feet as
measured at the lowest point of the arc of the blades. For vertical axis wind
turbines, the ground clearance shall be not less than 15 feet from the ground to the
bottom of the lowest revolving element, unless adequate safety measures are in
place.
5. Performance Standards.
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-36
a. Capacity: A Small Wind Energy System shall be rated to a maximum capacity of
100KW or less, and shall be used primarily to provide electricity on-site, rather than
as a generator to the grid.
b. Visual Impacts:
1) Each wind turbine shall be located to maximize the effectiveness of existing
vegetation, structures and topographic features to screen views of the wind
turbine(s) from occupied buildings, scenic resources, and public roads.
2) When existing features do not screen views of a wind turbine from occupied
buildings, scenic resources and public roads, screening shall be provided,
where feasible and effective, through the planting of trees and/or shrubs.
Generally, such plantings should be of native varieties. In order to maximize
the screening effect and minimize wind turbulence near the wind turbine,
plantings should be situated as near as possible to the occupied buildings,
scenic resources and/or public roads.
3) If requested by an affected party, the Planning Board may require a visual
impact assessment by a qualified professional. The Planning Board may, at
the applicant’s expense, require an independent second assessment. If the
Planning Board determines that the proposed project will constitute an
“undue adverse effect” upon a neighboring property, it may require mitigation
of the effects to the greatest practical extent. However, visual impact shall
not be grounds for denial of an application.
c. Lighting: Illumination, signals, signs, and antennas are expressly prohibited on
Small Wind Energy Systems except as required by the Federal Communications
Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration.
d. All ground mounted electrical and control equipment shall be labeled and secured to
prevent unauthorized access.
e. Tower: The tower shall be designed and installed such that public access via step
bolts or a ladder is prevented for a minimum of 12 feet above the ground. Lattice
structures shall be prohibited and guyed structures shall only be permitted if the
Code Enforcement Officer deems them to be appropriate for their intended site and
location within the Town.
f. Attached Small Wind Energy Systems: Small Wind Energy Systems designed for
attachment to a building shall be allowed provided the system meets the applicable
requirements of this section and is engineered to prevent damage or wear to the
building and injury to its inhabitants.
g. Shadow Flicker: Wind turbines shall be sited and designed to avoid unreasonable
adverse shadow flicker effects on any occupied building located on another
landowner’s property.
h. All electrical lines leading from the Small Wind Energy System shall be buried.
i. Both a manual and an automatic braking, governing or feathering system shall be
required to prevent uncontrolled rotation and noise.
j. Noise: A Small Wind Energy System shall conform to the noise provisions of Article
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-37
4.I.1 of this Ordinance, except during short-term events such as utility outages and
severe wind storms. Owners operating Small Wind Energy Systems which exceed
the allowed noise level shall be required, within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Code Enforcement Officer, (i) to modify the operation and/or design of the system to
bring it into compliance with this section and (ii) to pay any cost abutter(s) incurred
for a sound level test. Owner’s failure to comply with this section within the
designated time-frame shall constitute sufficient grounds for the Code Enforcement
Officer to demand and enforce the immediate shut-down of the small wind energy
system.
6. Submission Requirements. The following information shall be submitted to the Code
Enforcement Officer as part of the building permit application for a Small Wind Energy
System:
a. Standard drawings of the footprint on the lot showing (i) a title block with date, scale,
and arrow point north; (ii) the applicable zoning district; (iii) setbacks of all existing
and proposed structures or uses; (iv) the location of all existing and/or proposed
structures or uses; and (v) any overhead utility lines.
b. Small Wind Power Energy System specifications, including manufacturer and
model; diameter; generating capacity; tower height, type of tower (free-standing or
guyed); evidence of compliance with AWEA standards, and a photograph, line
drawing or digital image of the Small Wind Energy System.
c. Tower foundation blueprints or drawings.
d. Standard drawings and an engineering analysis of the tower or certification by the
manufacturer or by a professional mechanical, structural or civil engineer that the
system meets AWEA standards. The analysis shall include standards for ice and
wind loading and operations in winter weather and evidence that the proposed Small
Wind Energy System will not exceed the permitted noise level. If a distance of less
than system height is proposed from all boundaries and structures (including
allowances for wind easements and/or restrictive small wind energy easements),
then the Code Enforcement Officer may require that the Small Wind Energy System
and foundation design, taking into consideration soil conditions at the installation
site, be certified by a State of Maine Licensed Professional Engineer.
e. Confirmation that the generators and alternators specified do not interfere with radio
and television signals.
f. If applicable, documentary evidence of any restrictive small wind energy system
easements and wind easements.
g. Evidence of compliance with, or non-applicability of, FAA regulations.
h. Information demonstrating that the system will be used primarily to reduce onsite
consumption of electricity.
i. Evidence that the completed Small Wind Energy System is in compliance with
dimensional requirements.
j. Photographs of the proposed site and surrounding landscape.
k. Any additional information the Code Enforcement Officer deems to be necessary.
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-38
7. Prohibitions. Small Wind Energy Systems shall not be allowed in the Historic Village
District.
8. Expeditious Review and Commissioning. The Code Enforcement Officer shall review an
application for a Small Wind Energy System in accordance with Article 2.C.6. of this
Ordinance. Small Wind Energy Systems approved pursuant to this Section shall only
become operable when commissioned by inspection of the Code Enforcement Officer.
9. Fees. The Select Board shall determine the fees the Town charges to review an application
and to issue a permit for a Small Wind Energy System.
10. Wind Easement. A restrictive easement may be placed on a property abutting a property
with a Small Wind Energy System. If an easement contains terms restricting the uses and
structures within the easement area, a Small Wind Energy System may be permitted closer
to the easement abutter’s property line than would normally be allowed by applicable
setback requirements. Any property owner may grant a wind easement in the same manner
and with the same effect as a conveyance of any interest in real property. Wind easements
shall be created in writing and shall be filed and duly recorded. Recorded easements shall
run with the land or lands benefited and burdened and shall constitute a perpetual
easement, except that an easement may terminate upon the conditions stated therein.
11. Dismantling of Unsafe or Non-Functional Small Wind Energy Systems. In the event the
Code Enforcement Officer determines any Small Wind Energy System is unsafe, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall inform the owner of the determination in writing. The owner shall
immediately repair the Small Wind Energy System to meet all Federal, State and local
safety standards within 30 days of receipt of the Code Enforcement Officer’s written
determination. A facility that does not generate electricity for twelve (12) consecutive
months shall be deemed a discontinued use and shall be removed from the property by the
owner within 120 days of receipt of notice from the municipality, unless the owner provides
information that the Code Enforcement Officer deems sufficient to demonstrate that the
project has not been discontinued and should not be removed. The owner’s failure to
comply with the above provisions within its time limitation shall constitute sufficient grounds
for the Code Enforcement Officer to obtain a court order, in the interest of the safety of the
public, to enter the owner’s property and to dismantle the Small Energy Wind System at the
owner’s expense.
12. Insurance. If, after examining the documents submitted pursuant to Section 5, above, the
Code Enforcement Officer determines, in his or her sole discretion, that a collapse or other
failure of the Small Wind Energy System could threaten or endanger persons, buildings,
vehicles, vegetation or other features of abutting properties, the owner shall be required to
submit proof of adequate liability insurance against such collapse or failure as a condition
precedent to the commissioning of the Small Wind Energy System. The insurance shall be
maintained for as long as the Small Wind Energy System remains in place. The insurance
policy shall name the Town as an additional insured under its terms and shall require the
insurance company to give the Town thirty (30) days’ written notice prior to terminating the
policy.
Z. Transmission Lines
1. Transmission lines and structures built in existing corridors may exceed the height
restrictions set forth in this ordinance provided that all other dimensional standards and
performance standards are met, but shall not exceed an average of greater than 80’ within a
single project. This section shall not allow steel lattice-type structures. An applicant wishing
to exceed the height requirements of the ordinance shall be required to submit a visual
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-39
impact analysis prepared by a qualified professional as part of the site plan review process.
This analysis must identify the potential visual impacts on existing businesses and homes,
scenic roads, other scenic resources, and public recreation areas, within the viewshed of
the proposed transmission corridor. This analysis must use the methodology as described
in “Protecting Local Scenic Resources – Community Based Performance Standards.”1
For the purposes of this analysis, the limits of the viewshed shall not exceed one mile from
the transmission corridor, unless there is substantial evidence that the proposed
transmission line or structure would be visible beyond that distance. The analysis must, at a
minimum, quantify the following based on Table 1 below.
2. In its review of a proposed project, the Planning Board shall consider the following visual
elements in determining the off-site impact of the project.
a. Landscape compatibility, which is a function of the sub-elements of color, form, line
and texture. Compatibility is determined by whether the proposed activity differs
significantly from its existing surroundings and the context from which they are
viewed such that it becomes an unreasonable adverse impact on visual quality.
b. Scale contrast, which is determined by the size and scope of the proposed activity
given its specific location within the viewshed.
c. Spatial dominance, which is the degree to which an activity dominates the whole
landscape composition or dominates the landform, water bodies, or sky backdrop
within the viewshed.

3. Using the Visual Impact Matrix (Table 2), the Planning Board shall determine the level of
mitigation effort required to impacted properties. If mitigation is required, based on Table 2,
the applicant shall submit a mitigation strategy to the Planning Board. This strategy may
include, but shall not be limited to, either singly or in combination, the following:
a. Redesign or relocation of the project to reduce the impact severity rating to E. This may
include siting any portion of the project at a different location on the property of an existing
proposal, or siting any portion of the project on another property,
b. Addition of screening elements (e.g. trees, shrubs or earthen berms), or
c. A monetary offset sufficient to compensate, in full or in part, for the loss in market value to
affected properties if the height restriction is increased. Such loss in market value
shall be determined by an appraisal completed by a Maine certified general appraiser that
estimates the potential diminution of value if the structure height limit is exceeded.
d. Off-site measures that, in the opinion of the Planning Board, are reasonable mitigation for
visual impacts that may result from the transmission line in the case of Scenic Roads and
Public Recreational areas.
The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed mitigation strategy will reduce impacts to
affected properties to the greatest extent practicable. Any such mitigation proposal is subject to
review and approval of the Planning Board, which may require specific revisions to the strategy if it
determines that the visual impact is still unacceptable. Such revisions may include up to full
compensation for the loss in market value as described in subsection X.3.c, above. As used in
Section X, "impacted properties" means those properties identified in Table 2 that a visual impact
analysis demonstrates are subject to "severe", “strong”, or “moderate” visual impacts.

Where project adjustments or mitigation cannot reduce Impact Severity Rating to outcome “E”, a monetary
offset shall be paid to impacted properties in accordance with X.3.c.
AA. Wildlife/Natural Areas Preservation
Any project affecting significant wildlife or fisheries habitat, as identified in the 1998 Comprehensive
Plan or current Beginning with Habitat maps for Waldoboro, shall include mitigation measures
aimed at minimizing the adverse impacts of development on these resources. Such mitigation shall
include as a minimum:
1. Clustering. The clustering of the project to protect to the greatest extent the wildlife habitat
pursuant to the standards of Article 5 Section R., Open Space Subdivisions.
2. Vegetation. Efforts to preserve the existing vegetation in such a manner that the only
vegetation cut or removed shall be necessary for the actual construction involved. Specific
vegetation to be retained and to be removed shall be indicated on the development plan;
3. Erosion control. Best Management Practices for erosion control shall be used.
BB. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities

have sufficient height or cannot be increased in height at a reasonable cost
to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
3) Existing facilities - insufficient strength. Evidence that existing facilities do
not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed
antenna and related equipment. Specifically:
a) Equipment. Planned, necessary equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing facility, considering the existing and
planned use of those facilities, and these existing facilities cannot be
reinforced to accommodate the new equipment.

equipment would cause electromagnetic interference with the
antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna or
equipment on the existing facility would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
c) Insufficient space. Existing or approved facilities do not have space
on which planned equipment can be placed so it can function
effectively.
4) Unreasonable fees. For facilities existing prior to January 11, 2000, the fees,
costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share or
adapt an existing facility are unreasonable. Costs exceeding the pro rata
share of a new facility development are presumed to be unreasonable. This
evidence shall also be satisfactory for a tower built after January 11, 2000 or
amendment thereto.

reasonable fee not in excess of the actual cost of preparing a response;
2) Negotiation with third parties. Negotiate in good faith for shared use of the
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
5-44
wireless telecommunications facility by third parties;
3) Shared use. Allow shared use of the wireless telecommunications facility if
an applicant agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges for collocation;
4) Allow Local and County emergency operations communication devices to be
installed and maintained free of charge.
5) Reasonable charge. Require no more than a reasonable charge for shared
use, based on community rates and generally accepted accounting
principles. This charge may include but is not limited to a pro rata share of
the cost of site selection, planning project administration, land costs, site
design, construction, financing, return on equity, depreciation, and all of the
costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user
without causing electromagnetic interference. The amortization of the above
costs by the facility owner shall be accomplished at a reasonable rate, over
the useful life span of the facility.
j. Surety. A form of surety approved by the Planning Board to pay for the costs of
removing the facility if it is abandoned.

5) Notice of incompleteness. If the application is determined to be incomplete,
the Board shall inform the Code Enforcement Officer of the information
required to make the application complete. The Code Enforcement Officer
shall, within ten (10) work days, inform the applicant, in writing, of the
additional information required by the Planning Board. Upon the applicant’s
submission of such additional material, steps one, two and three shall be
repeated.
6) Decide on public hearing. If the application is determined to be complete, the
Planning Board shall deem the application pending and shall determine
whether or not to set the matter to public hearing.
The Planning Board may decide to hold a public hearing to maximize public
input and provide the applicant with more of an opportunity to prepare a
response to any criticism of the proposal before it. One indicator of when to
hold a public hearing is the amount of interest an application generates
when it is submitted. If the Planning Board receives many telephone calls or
a large group of people show up for the Planning Board meeting, then a
public hearing is probably in order.

With submittal of the application for Final Plan approval, the subdivider or site plan
developer shall provide one of the following performance guarantees for an amount
adequate to cover 110% the total construction costs of all required improvements for roads,
sidewalks, utilities, sewerage collection and treatment, water, storm water controls and solid
waste disposal taking into account the time-span of the construction schedule and the
inflation rate for construction costs:
a. Certified check, savings certificate. Either a certified check payable to the Town or a
savings account or certificate of deposit naming the Town as owner, for the
establishment of an escrow account;
b. Performance bond. A performance bond payable to the Town issued by a surety
company;
c. Letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution establishing
funding for the construction of the subdivision or site plan, from which the Town may
draw if construction is inadequate, or
d. Conditional approval. An offer of conditional approval limiting the number of units
built or lots sold until all required improvements have been constructed.
The conditions and amount of the performance guarantee shall be determined by
the Planning Board with the advice of the Road Commissioner, Board of Selectmen,
and/or Town Attorney.
2. Contents of Guarantee.
The performance guarantee shall contain a construction schedule, cost estimates for each
major phase of infrastructure construction reviewed and approved by the Town’s engineer
taking into account inflation, provisions for inspections of each phase of construction,
provisions for the release of part or all of the performance guarantee to the developer, and a
date after which the developer will be in default and the Town shall have access to the
funds to finish construction.

bond or portions of the bond to the subdivider or site plan developer, and the procedures for
collection by the municipality. The bond documents shall specifically reference the
subdivision or site plan for which approval is sought.
5. Letter of Credit.
An irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or other lending institution shall indicate that funds
have been set aside for the construction of the subdivision or site plan and may not be used
for any other project or loan.
6. Conditional Agreement.
The Planning Board, at its discretion, may provide for the subdivider or site plan developer
to enter into a binding agreement with the municipality in lieu of the other financial
performance guarantees. Such an agreement shall provide for approval of the Final Plan
on the condition that up to six (6) lots may be sold or built upon until either:
a. Board certification. It is certified by the Board, or its agent, that all of the required
improvements have been installed in accordance with this Ordinance and the
regulations of the appropriate utilities; or
b. Performance guarantee. A performance guarantee, acceptable to the municipality, is
submitted in an amount necessary to cover the completion of the required
improvements at an amount adjusted for inflation and prorated for the portions of the
required improvements already installed.
Notice of the agreement and any conditions shall be on the Final Plan which is recorded at
the Registry of Deeds. Release from the agreement shall follow the procedures for release
of the performance guarantees contained in Section 8 below.
7. Phasing of Development.
The Board may approve plans to develop a major subdivision in separate and distinct
phases. This may be accomplished by limiting final approval to those lots abutting that
section of the proposed subdivision street which is covered by a performance guarantee.
When development is phased, road construction shall commence from an existing public
way. Final approval of lots in subsequent phases shall be given only upon satisfactory
completion of all requirements pertaining to previous phases.
8. Release of Guarantee.
Prior to the release of any part of the performance guarantee, the Planning Board shall
determine to its satisfaction, in part upon the report of the Code Enforcement Officer and
whatever other agencies and departments may be involved, that the proposed
improvements meet or exceed the design and construction requirements for that portion of
the improvements for which the release is requested.
9. Default.
If, upon inspection, the Code Enforcement Officer finds that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications
filed as part of the application, he or she shall so report in writing to the Board of Selectmen,
Site Plan and Subdivision Review
6-15
the Planning Board, and the subdivider or builder. The Board of Selectmen shall take any
steps necessary to preserve the Town's rights.

Shoreland Zoning
7-4
F. Land Use Standards
All land use activities within the Shoreland Zone shall conform to the following provisions, if
applicable.
1. Minimum lot standards
a. Lots. All lots shall comply with Article 3, Section H.
b. Exclusions. Land below the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge
of a wetland and land beneath roads serving more than two (2) lots shall not be
included toward calculating minimum lot area.
c. Opposite sides of a road. Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road
shall be considered each a separate tract or parcel of land unless such road was
established by the owner of land on both sides thereof after September 22, 1971.
d. Lot width. The minimum width of any portion of any lot within one hundred (100)
feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body or upland
edge of a wetland shall be equal to or greater than the shore frontage requirement
for a lot with the proposed use.
e. Multiple structures. If more than one (1) residential dwelling unit or more than one
(1) principal commercial or industrial structure is constructed on a single parcel, all
dimensional requirements shall be met for each additional dwelling unit or principal
structure.
f. Reduced lot size. The Planning Board may allow subdivided development on
reduced lot sizes in return for open space where the Planning Board determines that
the benefits of the cluster approach will prevent the loss of natural features without
increasing the net density of the development. The overall dimensional
requirements including frontage and lot area per dwelling unit must be met. When
determining whether dimensional requirements are met, only land areas within the
Shoreland Zone shall be considered.
g. Common area. Each shoreland common area shall have a minimum of two hundred
(200) feet of shore frontage plus an additional twenty-five (25) feet in shore frontage
for each family, lot or residential dwelling unit above five (5) which has access or
right of use to the shoreland common area.
h. Governmental, institutional, commercial or industrial per principal structure. Within
the Shoreland Zone adjacent to non-tidal areas the minimum shore frontage is 300
feet.
2. Principal and accessory structures. All structures shall comply with the setback
requirements of Article 3, Section H. and the following:
a. Setbacks. All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back at least one
hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of great
ponds; rivers that flow to great ponds; salt water bodies; or the upland edge of a
coastal wetland. The setback from a freshwater wetland shall be at least seventyfive
(75) feet, horizontal distance. Exceptions: In the General Development I District
the setback from the normal high-water line shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet,
horizontal distance. In the Commercial Fisheries/Maritime Activities District there
Shoreland Zoning
7-5
shall be no minimum setback. In the Resource Protection District the setback
requirement shall be 250 feet, horizontal distance, except for structures, roads,
parking spaces or other regulated objects specifically allowed in that district, in
which case the setback requirements specified above shall apply. Abutting a salt
water body or coastal wetland, landscaping (not to include structures) is permitted
starting seventy-five (75) feet back from the normal high-water line of the water body
or the upland edge of the wetland. A naturally-vegetated shoreland buffer strip must
be preserved as described in Section 17. b.
Where uncertainty exists as to the exact location of the normal high-water line the
Code Enforcement Officer may choose to make such a determination, or may have
the determination made by a qualified professional. If the CEO's decision is
unacceptable to the applicant, another determination may be sought from a mutually
acceptable professional. If that determination is rejected by either party, the case
shall go to the Board of Appeals. The Board may employ expert assistance. All
costs, by whomever incurred, shall be borne by the applicant.
In addition:
1) Exemptions. The water body or wetland setback provision does not apply to
structures which require direct access as an operational necessity, such as
piers, docks, and retaining walls, nor to other functionally water-dependent
uses.
2) Coastal Bluffs. For principal structures, water and wetland setback measurements
shall be taken from the top of a coastal bluff that has been identified on
Coastal Bluff maps as being “highly unstable” or “unstable” by the Maine
Geological Survey pursuant to its “Classification of Coastal Bluffs” and
published on the most recent Coastal Bluff map. If the applicant and the
permitting official(s) are in disagreement as to the specific location of a “highly
unstable” or “unstable” bluff, or where the top of the bluff is located, the
applicant may at his or her expense, employ a Maine Registered Professional
Engineer, a Maine Certified Soil Scientist, a Maine State Geologist, or other
qualified individual to make a determination. If agreement is still not reached,
the applicant may appeal the matter to the Board of Appeals.
3) Accessory Structure. On a non-conforming lot of record on which only a
residential structure exists, and it is not possible to place an accessory
structure meeting the required water body, tributary stream or wetland
setbacks, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a permit to place a single
accessory structure, with no utilities, for the storage of yard tools and similar
equipment. Such accessory structure shall not exceed eighty (80) square feet
in area nor eight (8) feet in height, and shall be located as far from the
shoreline or tributary stream as practical and shall meet all other applicable
standards, including lot coverage and vegetation clearing limitations. In no
case shall the structure be located closer to the shoreline or tributary stream
than the principal structure.
4) Authorization to increase. The Planning Board is authorized to increase the
required setback of a proposed structure, as a condition to permit approval,
if necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Article. Instances where a
greater setback may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, areas of
steep slope; shallow or erodible soils; or where an adequate vegetative
buffer does not exist.

including basements, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the elevation of the
100 year flood, the flood of record, or in the absence of these, the flood as defined by
soil types identified as recent flood-plain soils. In those municipalities that participate
in the National Flood Insurance Program and have adopted the April 2005 version, or
later version, of the Floodplain Management Ordinance, accessory structures may be
placed in accordance with the standards of that ordinance and need not meet the
elevation requirements of this paragraph. (see also Floodplain Management, Article 8
Section C.6. and 7.)
d. Non-vegetated surfaces. The total area of all structures, parking lots and other nonvegetated
surfaces within the Shoreland Zone shall not exceed twenty (20) percent
of the lot or a portion thereof located within the Shoreland Zone, including land area

cannot be stabilized with vegetative plantings;
4) The total height of the wall(s), in the aggregate, is no more than 24 inches;
5) Retaining walls are located outside of the 100-year floodplain on rivers,
streams, coastal wetlands, and tributary streams, as designated on the
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate
Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the
absence of these, by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils.
6) The area behind the wall is revegetated with grass, shrubs, trees, or a
combination thereof, and no further structural development will occur within
the setback area, including patios and decks; and
7) A vegetated buffer area must be established within 25 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or
upland edge of a wetland. The buffer area must meet the following
characteristics:

a. Setbacks. Roads and driveways shall be set back at least one hundred (100) feet
from the normal high-water line of a great pond or a river that flows to a great pond,
the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland
edge of a wetland unless no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the
Planning Board. If no other reasonable alternative exists, the Planning Board may
reduce the road and/or driveway setback requirement to no less than fifty (50) feet
upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will be used to
prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland. Such
techniques may include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling basins,
and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so as
to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland.
On slopes of greater than twenty (20) percent the road and/or driveway setback
shall be increased by ten (10) feet for each five (5) percent increase in slope above
twenty (20) percent.
This paragraph shall neither apply to approaches to water crossings nor to roads or
driveways that provide access to permitted structures and facilities located nearer to
the shoreline, tributary stream, or wetland due to an operational necessity., excluding
temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to
permitted structures within the setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of
this Section except for that portion of the road or driveway necessary for direct access
to the structure.
b. Existing road expansion. Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal
road right-of-way regardless of its setback from a water body, tributary stream or
wetland.
c. Resource protection district prohibition. New roads and driveways are prohibited in a
Resource Protection District except to provide access to permitted uses within the
district, or as approved by the Planning Board upon a finding that no reasonable
alternative route or location is available outside the district, in which case the road
and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water
line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.
Shoreland Zoning
7-11
d. Slope. Road banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1)
vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for
erosion and sedimentation control contained in subsection 18.
e. Standards. Road and driveway grades shall be in conformance with the standards in
Article 4, Section T.3, of this Ordinance.
f. Buffer strip. In order to prevent road surface drainage from directly entering water
bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads shall be designed, constructed, and
maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip of at least fifty (50) feet in width
plus two times the average slope percentage converted to feet, between the outflow
point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary
stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Road surface drainage which is directed to an
unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the
runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.
g. Drainage facilities. Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water
turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto
unscarified buffer strips before the flow in the road or ditches gains sufficient volume
or head to erode the road or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall apply:
1) Spacing. Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts
shall be spaced along the road at intervals no greater than indicated in the
following table:
Road Grade (Percent) Spacing (Feet)
0-2 250
3-5 200-135
6-10 100-80
11-15 80-60
16-20 60-45
21+ 40
2) Drainage dips. Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts
only where the road grade is ten (10) percent or less.
3) Road grade 10% or more. On road sections having slopes greater than ten
(10) percent, ditch relief culverts shall be placed across the road at
approximately a thirty (30) degree angle down slope from a line
perpendicular to the center line of the road.
4) Culverts. Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed
in order to allow for effective functioning, and their inlet and outlet ends shall
be stabilized with appropriate materials.
h. Maintenance. Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm water
runoff control installations associated with roads and driveways shall be maintained
on a regular basis to assure effective functioning.

following:
a. Minimize runoff. All new construction and development shall be designed to
minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess of the natural pre-development
conditions. Where possible, existing natural runoff control features such as berms,
swales, terraces and wooded areas shall be retained in order to reduce runoff and
encourage infiltration of storm waters.
b. Maintenance. Storm water runoff control systems shall be maintained as necessary
to ensure proper functioning.
11. Septic waste disposal
a. Installation. All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed in
conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules
(Rules). The Rules, among other requirements, include:
1) Setback. The minimum setback for new subsurface sewage disposal
systems shall be no less than one hundred (100) horizontal feet from the
normal high-water line of a perennial water body. Clearing or removal of
woody vegetation necessary to site a new system and any associated fill
extensions shall not extend closer than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or the upland edge

b. Manure storage. Manure shall not be stored or stockpiled within one hundred (100)
feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond, or a river flowing to a great pond, or within
one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of other water bodies, tributary streams,
or wetlands. All manure storage areas within the shoreland zone must be
constructed or modified such that the facility produces no discharge of effluent or
contaminated storm water.
c. Soil tillage in excess of 40,000 square feet. Agricultural activities involving tillage of
soil greater than forty thousand (40,000) square feet in surface area within the
shoreland zone shall require a Conservation Plan to be filed with the Planning
Board. Non-conformance with the provisions of said plan shall be considered to be
a violation of this Article. Assistance in preparing a soil and water conservation plan
may be available through the local Soil and Water Conservation District office.
d. Tilling setback. There shall be no new tilling of soil within one hundred (100) feet,
horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond or other water
bodies; nor within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and
wetlands. Operations in existence on the effective date of this Article (and not in
compliance with this provision) may be maintained.

in conformance with the above setback provisions may continue, provided that such
grazing is conducted in accordance with a Conservation Plan.
16. Timber harvesting
a. In a Resource Protection District abutting a great pond, timber harvesting shall be
limited to the following:
1) Within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the
normal high-water line, timber harvesting may be conducted when the
following conditions are met:
a) The ground is frozen;
b) There is no resultant soil disturbance;
c) The removal of trees is accomplished using a cable or boom and
there is no entry of tracked or wheeled vehicles into the 75-foot strip

than 30% of the trees 6 inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 ½
feet above ground level, are cut in any 10-year period; and a welldistributed
stand of trees and other natural vegetation remains; and
e) A licensed professional forester has marked the trees to be
harvested prior to a permit being issued by the municipality.
2) Beyond the 75 foot strip referred to in Section F.16.a.1 above, timber
harvesting is permitted in accordance with paragraph 2 below except that in
no case shall the average residual basal area of trees over 4 ½ inches in
diameter at 4 1/2 feet above ground level be reduced to less than 30 square
feet per acre.
b. Except in areas as described in Section F.16.a. above, timber harvesting shall
conform with the following provisions:
1) Selective cutting of no more than forty (40) percent of the total volume of

(10,000) square feet in the forest canopy. Where such openings
exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet they shall be at least one
hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, apart. Such clearcut
openings shall be included in the calculation of total volume removal.
Volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
2) Timber harvesting operations exceeding the 40% limitation in Section
F.16.b.1) above, may be allowed by the Planning Board upon a clear
showing, including a forest management plan signed by a Maine licensed
professional forester, that such an exception is necessary for good forest
management and will be carried out in accordance with the purposes of this
Ordinance. The Planning Board shall notify the Commissioner of the
Department of Environmental Protection of each exception allowed, within
fourteen (14) days of the Planning Board's decision.
3) No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty (50) feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body. In all other areas
slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on

b) The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.
5) All crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert, except in
areas with low banks and channel beds which are composed of gravel, rock
or similar hard surface which would not be eroded or otherwise damaged.
6) Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and designed so as
to prevent water runoff from directly entering the water body or tributary
stream. Upon completion of timber harvesting, temporary bridges and
culverts shall be removed and areas of exposed soil revegetated.
7) Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where the operation of
machinery used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil
shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least
seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, in width for slopes up to ten (10)
percent shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil and the normal
high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland. For each ten
(10) percent increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by
twenty (20) feet, horizontal distance. The provisions of this paragraph apply
only to a face sloping toward the water body or wetland, provided, however,
that no portion of such exposed mineral soil on a back face shall be closer
than twenty five (25) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water
line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.
17. Clearing or Removal of Vegetation for Activities Other Than Timber Harvesting
Shoreland Zoning
7-16
a. Resource Protection District prohibition. In a Resource Protection District abutting a
great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending
one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line,
except to remove safety hazards.
Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection District the cutting or removal of vegetation
shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that
district.
b. Other areas. Except in areas as described in Section P 17a, above, and except to
allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one
hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line of a
great pond or a river flowing to a great pond and from any other water body, tributary
stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be
preserved as follows:
1) Abutting a salt water body or coastal wetland, landscaping (not to include
structures) is permitted starting seventy-five (75) feet back from the normal
high water line of the water body or the upland edge of a wetland.
2) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest
canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not
present) as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown.
However, a footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured between
tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of
sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
3) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a
well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained. A
"well-distributed stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond or a river or stream
flowing to a great pond, shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of 24
or more in each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular (1250 square feet) area as
determined by the following rating system.
Diameter of Tree at 4-1/2 feet
Above Ground Level (inches) Points
2 to < 4 in. 1
4 to <8 in. 2
8 to < 12 in. 4
12 in. or greater 8
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "welldistributed
stand of trees and other vegetation" is defined as maintaining a
minimum score of 16 per 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area.
As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot x 50-foot plot contains
four (4) trees between 2 and 4 inches in diameter, two trees between 4 and
8 inches in diameter, three trees between 8 and 12 inches in diameter, and
two trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(4x1)+(2x2) + (3x4) + (2x8) = 36 points

Thus, the 25-foot by 50-foot plot contains trees worth 36 points. Trees
totaling 12 points (36- 24 =12) may be removed from the plot provided that
no cleared openings are created.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
a) The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where
the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;
b) Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous
plot;
c) Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation
removed except as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
d) Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation
removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise
allowed by this Ordinance;
e) Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25-
foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12
inches in diameter.
For the purposes of this Section “other natural vegetation” is defined as
retaining existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground
cover and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2) inches in
diameter at four and one half (4 ½) feet above ground level for each 25-foot
by 50-foot rectangle area. If five (5) saplings do not exist, no woody stems
less than two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until five (5) saplings
have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40% of the total
volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, or 12.5 inches in
circumference, measured at 4½ feet above ground level may be
removed in any ten (10) year period.
Vegetation less that four (4) inches in diameter at four and one half
(4 1/2) feet above ground level may be pruned and thinned provided
that sufficient numbers of trees and other vegetation are retained to
ensure adequate regeneration of the overstory and to retard erosion.
4) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under
three (3) feet in height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the
forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered, or removed, except to provide for
a footpath or other permitted uses as described in paragraphs b. and b.2
above.
5) Pruning of tree branches on the bottom one-third (1/3) of the tree is allowed.
6) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of stormdamaged,
diseased, unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared
openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless
existing new tree growth is present.

Section 17.b. does not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities
adjacent to public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the
minimum area necessary.
c. Forty percent (40%) limitation. At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet,
horizontal distance, from a great pond or a river flowing to a great pond and from the
normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge
of a wetland, except to allow for the development of permitted uses, there shall be
permitted on any lot, in any ten (10) year period, selective cutting of not more than
forty (40) percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, or 12.5
inches in circumference, measured at 4½ feet above ground level. Tree removal in
conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the forty
(40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards volume may be
considered to be equivalent to basal area.
In no event shall cleared openings for development, including, but not limited to,
principal and accessory structures, driveways and sewage disposal areas, exceed in
the aggregate, twenty five (25) percent of the lot area within the shoreland zone or
ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is greater, including land previously
developed. This provision shall not apply to the General Development or Water-
Dependent Commercial Maritime Activities Districts.
d. Lawns and fields. Lawns and fields within one hundred (100) feet of any water body
or wetland shall not receive fertilizers and pesticides.

A. Purpose and Establishment
Certain areas of the Town of Waldoboro, Maine are subject to periodic flooding, causing serious
damages to properties within these areas. Relief is available in the form of flood insurance as
authorized by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.
Therefore, the Town of Waldoboro, Maine has chosen to become a participating community in the
National Flood Insurance Program, and agrees to comply with the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended) as delineated in this Ordinance.
It is the intent of the Town of Waldoboro, Maine to require the recognition and evaluation of flood
hazards in all official actions relating to land use in the floodplain areas having special flood
hazards.
The Town of Waldoboro has the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures to reduce
future flood losses pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A., § 3001-3007, 4352 and 4401-4407. This Ordinance
repeals and replaces any municipal ordinance previously enacted to comply with the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended).
The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid Act, provides that areas of the
Town of Waldoboro having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood
hazard areas. This Ordinance establishes a Flood Hazard Development Permit system and review
procedure for development activities in the designated flood hazard areas of the Town of
Waldoboro, Maine.
The areas of special flood hazard, Zones A and A1-3O, have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a report entitled "Flood Insurance Study - Town of Waldoboro,
Maine, Lincoln County," dated October 3, 1984 with accompanying "Flood Insurance Rate Map"
dated April 3, 1985 and "Flood Boundary and Floodway Map" dated April 3, 1985, which are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.
B. Permit Required
Before any construction or other development (as defined in Article 16), including the placement of
manufactured homes, begins within any areas of special flood hazard established in Section A, a
Flood Hazard Development Permit shall be obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer in
accordance with the application requirements of Section D. This permit shall be in addition to any
other permits which may be required pursuant to the codes and ordinances of the Town of
Waldoboro, Maine.

Non-Conforming Uses
10-1
A. Purpose
It is the intent of this Ordinance to promote land use conformities, except that non-conforming
conditions that existed before the effective date of this Ordinance shall generally be allowed to
continue, subject to the requirements set forth herein. Except as otherwise provided in this
Ordinance, a non-conforming condition shall not be permitted to become more non-conforming. In
a situation of abutting non-conforming properties, one may become more non-conforming provided
the second lot non-conformity is lessened.
B. General Provisions
1. Continuance: The lawful use of any building, structure or land that is made non-conforming
by reason of the enactment of this Ordinance, or which shall be made non-conforming by
reason of a subsequent amendment, may be continued, subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
2. Transfer of Ownership: Ownership of lots, structures and uses that remain lawful but
become non-conforming by the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance may be
transferred, and the new owner may continue the non-conforming use or continue to use the
non-conforming structure or lot, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.
3. Repair and maintenance. This Ordinance allows, without a permit, the normal upkeep and
maintenance of non-conforming uses and structures including repairs or renovations which
do not involve expansion of the non-conforming use or structure, and such other changes in
a non-conforming use or structure as federal, State, or local building and safety codes may
require.
C. Non-conforming Structures
1. Non-conforming Structure Defined: A non-conforming structure is any structure that does
not meet one or more of the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
2. Continuance: A non-conforming structure that is lawful at the effective date of the adoption
or subsequent amendment of this Ordinance may continue to be occupied subject to the
provisions of this section. A structure that is made non-conforming by an action of eminent
domain of a public entity may continue to be occupied subject to the provisions of this
section.
3. Expansion
a. Non-shoreland area: A non-conforming structure may be repaired, maintained,
improved or replaced, but shall not be expanded, enlarged or increased unless such
expansion does not make the structure more non-conforming regarding the
dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, or unless a variance from such
requirements is granted by the Board of Appeals according to the criteria
established in Article 11.
ARTICLE 10. NON-CONFORMING USES
Non-Conforming Uses
10-2
b. Floodplain area. New construction to, or substantial improvement of, any structure
located within Zone A and A1-30 of Article 8 and Map shall have the lowest floor
(including the basement) elevated to two (2) feet above the base flood elevation as
certified by a registered Maine surveyor or registered professional engineer or
architect.
c. Shoreland area - fresh water. If any portion of a structure is less than the required
setback from the normal high-water line of a fresh water body or upland edge of a
freshwater wetland, that portion of the structure shall not be expanded, as measured
in floor area or volume, by thirty percent (30%) or more, during the lifetime of the
structure.
d. Shoreland areas - salt water. A non-conforming structure may be added to or
expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a
new structure, if such addition or expansion does not increase the non-conformity of
the structure, and is in accordance with subparagraphs 1) and 2) below.
1) Non-conforming setbacks. Legally existing non-conforming principal and
accessory structures that do not meet the water body or wetland setback
requirements may be expanded or altered as follows, as long as all other
applicable standards contained in this Ordinance are met.
a) Within twenty-five (25) feet of the water. Expansion of any portion of
a structure within twenty-five (25) feet of the normal high-water line
of a salt water body is prohibited, even if the expansion will not
increase non-conformity with the water body setback requirement.
b) Accessory structure. Expansion of an accessory structure that is
located closer to the normal high-water line of a salt water body than
the principal structure is prohibited, even if the expansion will not
increase non-conformity with the water body setback requirement.
c) Within one hundred (100) feet of salt water. For structures located
less than one hundred (100) feet from the normal high-water line of a
salt water body, the maximum combined total floor area for all
structures is 1,000 square feet, and the maximum height of any
structure is twenty (20) feet or the height of the existing structure,
whichever is greater.
For the purposes of this subsection, a basement is not counted
toward floor area.
2) Special expansion allowance. Existing principal and accessory structures
that exceed the floor area or height limits established in d. 1. c. above may
not be expanded, except that the limits may be exceeded by not more than
500 square feet provided that all of the following requirements are met:
a) Fifty (50) foot setback. The principal structure is set back at least fifty
(50) feet from the normal high-water line of a salt water body.
b) Trees and vegetation. A well-distributed stand of trees and other
vegetation extends at least fifty (50) feet in depth as measured from
the normal high-water line for the entire width of the property. A
Non-Conforming Uses
10-3
"well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation" shall be defined
as maintaining a rating score of 24 or more in each 25-foot by 50-
foot rectangular (1250 square feet) area as determined by the
following rating system.
Diameter of Tree at 4 1/2 feet
Above Ground Level (inches) Points
2 - < 4 in. 1
4 - < 8 in. 2
8 - < 12 in. 4
12 in. or greater 8
If a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation meeting the
requirements of this subparagraph is not present, the 500 square
foot special expansion allowance may be permitted only in
conjunction with a written plan, including a scaled site drawing,
submitted by the property owner, and approved by the Planning
Board or its designee, to re-establish a buffer of trees, shrubs and
other ground cover within fifty (50) feet of the normal high-water line.
Except for the allowable footpath, there exists complete natural
ground cover, consisting of forest duff, shrubs and other woody and
herbaceous vegetation within 50 feet, horizontal distance, of the
normal high-water line. Where natural ground cover is lacking the
area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch and plantings of
native shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation in
quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective
infiltration of stormwater.
c) Mitigation plan. A written plan by a qualified professional (foresters,
arborists, landscape architects, and landscape contractors),
including a scaled site drawing, is approved by the Planning Board
and is developed, implemented and maintained to address the
following mitigation measures for the property within the shoreland
zone.
i) Un-stabilized areas. Un-stabilized areas resulting in soil
erosion must be mulched, seeded or otherwise stabilized and
maintained to prevent further erosion and sedimentation to
salt water bodies.
ii) Storm water flow. Roofs and associated drainage systems,
driveways, parking areas, and other non-vegetated surfaces
must be designed or modified, as necessary, to prevent
concentrated flow of storm water runoff from reaching a salt
water body. Where possible, runoff must be directed through
a vegetated area or infiltrated into the soil through the use of
a dry well, stone apron, or similar device.
3) Planting requirements. Any planting or re-vegetation required as a condition
to the Special Expansion Allowance must be in accordance with a written
plan drafted by a qualified professional (foresters, arborists, landscape
architects, and landscape contractors), be implemented at the time of
construction, and be designed to meet the rating scores contained in
Non-Conforming Uses
10-4
subparagraph 2) b), above and the ground cover requirements of paragraph
2) b, above, when the vegetation matures within the fifty (50) foot strip. At a
minimum, the plan must provide for the establishment of a well-distributed
planting of saplings spaced so that there is at least one (1) sapling per eighty
(80) square feet of newly established buffer. Planted saplings may be no
less than three (3) feet tall for coniferous species and no less than six (6)
feet tall for deciduous species. The planting plan must include a mix of at
least three (3) native tree species found growing in adjacent areas, with no
one species making up more than fifty percent (50%) of the number of
saplings planted unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board or its
designee, based on adjacent stand comparison. All aspects of the
implemented plan must be maintained by the applicant and future owners.
4) Filing and reporting requirements. Written plans pursuant to this section
must be filed with the Lincoln County Registry of Deeds. A copy of all
permits issued pursuant to this section must be forwarded by the Town of
Waldoboro to the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental
Protection within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the permit.
e. Foundation (fresh and salt water). Construction or enlargement of a foundation
beneath the existing structure is not considered an expansion of the structure
provided: that the structure and new foundation are placed such that the setback
requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning
Board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria specified in Article 10
Section C. 4. Relocation, below; that the completed foundation does not extend
beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure; and that the foundation does not
cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet, as
measured from the uphill side of the structure, it shall not be considered to be an
expansion of the structure.
4. Relocation. A non-conforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the
parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all
setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board,
and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal
system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater
Disposal Rules (“Rules”), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law
and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the
structure to be more non-conforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical
extent, the Planning Board shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the
potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent
properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic
systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the
relocation.
When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order
to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to
compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated
structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as
follows:
a. Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one
native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees
Non-Conforming Uses
10-5
are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of
trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland
than the trees that were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or
destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least
the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed,
damaged, or removed must be re-established within the setback area. The
vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or
ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
b Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the
structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs,
trees, or a combination thereof.
5. Reconstruction or replacement. Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the
required setback from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland
edge of a wetland and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed by more than fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or
removal, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within
eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided in
shoreland areas that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water
setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board in
accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be
reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity.
In shoreland areas, any non-conforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by fifty
percent (50%) or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance
and repair, may be reconstructed in place with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer.
In shoreland areas, in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement
meets the water setback to the greatest practical extent the Planning Board shall consider
in addition to the criteria in paragraph 2 above, the physical condition and type of foundation
present, if any.
6. Change of use of a non-conforming structure (shoreland areas only). The use of a nonconforming
structure may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board after
receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse
impact on the water body or wetland or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources
than the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning Board shall require
written documentation from the applicant regarding the probable effects on public health
and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative
cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain
management, archaeological and historic resources, commercial fishing and maritime
activities, and other functionally water-dependent uses.
7. Non-conforming Single-Wide Manufactured Homes: See Article 5 Section X. of this
Ordinance.
D. Non-conforming Uses
1. Non-conforming Use Defined: A non-conforming use is any use of land, buildings, or
Non-Conforming Uses
10-6
structures lawfully existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance,
which does not conform to the requirements of the district or districts in which it is located.
2. Continuance: The lawful use of any building, structure, or land, which is made nonconforming
by reason of the enactment of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to this
Ordinance, may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
3. Discontinuance: A non-conforming use of a building, structure or land shall be considered
discontinued if, in the case of a building or structure, it remains vacant for a period of twelve
(12) months, and in the case of an activity, if it ceases for a period of twelve (12) months.
During the following twelve (12) month period, the building or structure may be reoccupied
and the use re-established with approval by the Planning Board pursuant to Site Plan
Review. Subsequent use shall conform to the regulations specified in this Ordinance for the
district or districts in which the building, structure or land is located. If a non-conforming use
is superseded by a permitted use, the non-conforming use shall not thereafter be resumed.
Resumption of a residential use that has been discontinued for over one (1) year will be
allowed, provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes
during the preceding five (5) years.
4. Change of Use: An existing non-conforming use of a building, structure or land may be
changed to another non-conforming use only when the new use has no greater impact on
the subject and adjacent properties and resources, including water-dependent uses in the
Commercial Fisheries/Maritime Activities District, than the former use, as determined by the
Planning Board. In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning
Board shall require written documentation from the applicant regarding the probable effects
on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife
habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty,
floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources, commercial fishing and
maritime activities, and other functionally water-dependent uses.
5. Expansion of a Non-conforming, Non-residential Use: The Planning Board may issue
approval for an expansion of a non-conforming, non-residential use up to a maximum of
fifteen (15) percent of the original floor area of the existing structure, or in the case of an
outdoor use, fifteen (15) percent of the original land area used for the activity, according to
the criteria for site plan review contained in Article 6 of this ordinance, provided that the
expansion meets the dimensional requirements and other provisions of this Ordinance. The
expansion of a non-conforming use shall not be for the purpose of changing that use to
another non-conforming use, except as provided in paragraph 4 above.
6. Expansions of Non-conforming, Residential Uses: Any non-conforming residential use of a
building outside of the shoreland zone may be expanded upon approval from the Planning
Board under the criteria for site plan review contained in Article 6 of this Ordinance,
provided that said expansion is in compliance with the dimensional requirements and other
provisions of this Ordinance.
7. Shoreland Zone: Expansions of non-conforming uses within the shoreland zone are
prohibited except that non-conforming residential uses may, after obtaining approval from
the Planning Board, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions
of such structures as approved by the Planning Board.
E. Non-conforming Lots of Record
1. Non-conforming lots. A non-conforming lot of record as of the effective date of this
Non-Conforming Uses
10-7
Ordinance or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance,
provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the
same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except lot size and frontage can
be met. Variances relating to setback or other requirements not involving lot size or
frontage shall be obtained by action of the Board of Appeals.
2. Contiguous built lots. If two (2) or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint
ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not
meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure
exists on each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together,
provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law and Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules
are complied with.
If two (2) or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the
effective date of this Ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the
above-referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot
thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this
Ordinance.
3. Contiguous lots - vacant or partially built. If two (2) or more contiguous lots or parcels are in
single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance, and if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of
this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one (1) or more of the lots are vacant or
contain no principal structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet
the dimensional requirements.

ARTICLE 11. APPEALS
Appeals
11-2
f. Reconsideration. The Board may reconsider any decision. The Board must decide
to reconsider any decision, notify all interested parties and make any change in its
original decision within forty-five (45) days of its prior decision. The Board may
conduct additional hearings and receive additional evidence and testimony.
Reconsideration should be for one of the following reasons:
1) The record contains significant factual errors due to fraud or mistake
regarding facts upon which the decision was based; or
2) The Board misinterpreted the ordinance, followed improper procedures, or
acted beyond its jurisdiction.
g. Rules and Records. The Board of Appeals shall adopt rules for transaction of
business and the secretary shall keep a record of its resolutions, transactions,
correspondence, findings and determinations. All records shall be deemed public
and may be inspected at reasonable times.
4. Duties and Powers
a. To interpret provisions of this Ordinance called into question. 30-A, M.R.S.A., §
4353 states that the Board of Appeals may interpret provisions of a Zoning
Ordinance which are called into question. In practical terms, this means that an
individual may appeal the denial of a permit which was based on an interpretation of
a key provision of this Ordinance. In order to meet their responsibility, all Board
members should be familiar with this Ordinance.
It should be emphasized that the Board of Appeals is a quasi-judicial body that
establishes precedents which it should later follow. Therefore, when interpreting the
Ordinance the Board of Appeals should try very hard to look at what this Ordinance
does say rather than what the Board of Appeals wants it to say.
1) General rules of interpretation. Using common sense is an important part of
the interpretive process. Where there is no evidence of a contrary meaning,
ordinance language should be given its ordinary meaning.
Sometimes the full meaning of a word in this Ordinance is not clear-cut,
leaving it open to more than one interpretation. In such cases, doubts about
the meaning of a word can often be resolved by paying close attention to
words that have been tacked on to this Ordinance for clarification in a later
enactment.
Problems of interpretation caused by ambiguous key words and phrases in
this Ordinance may sometimes be cleared up by asking the advice of a
lawyer or by relying on definitions given by “qualified experts” often found in
technical assistance publications.
2) Conflicts in this Ordinance. In a situation where the Ordinance contains
conflicting provisions, the Board of Appeals shall resolve the conflict in
accordance with Article 1, Section E. and report the internal conflict to the
Planning Board for correction.
3) Legislative intent. Statement of purpose, often included in a law or this
Appeals
11-3
Ordinance, may give a better understanding of what was intended when the
law or this Ordinance was enacted. Referring to such statements of purpose
may make interpretation easier. The Board of Appeals may also rely upon
the testimony of a person who helped draft the law or this Ordinance, to
determine what was intended by a key word or phrase.
b. To hear administrative appeals. The Board of Appeals has the authority to hear
appeals in the administration of this Ordinance in order to determine if the Code
Enforcement Officer or the Planning Board erred in granting or denying a permit. An
applicant who is denied a permit may appeal. If the Board of Appeals finds that the
Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board acted in error, it should order the error
to be corrected. The Board of Appeals has no authority to take the action of the
Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board for them, or force them to comply. If
the Code Enforcement Officer ignores an order of the Board of Appeals, the
appellant can then take court action to force compliance. See Article 11 Section
B.2, Variance Appeals, below.
c. Administrative Appeals: To hear and decide administrative appeals, on an appellate
basis, where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by, or failure to act by, the Planning
Board in the administration of this Ordinance; and to hear and decide administrative
appeals on a de novo basis where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by, or failure to act by,
the Code Enforcement Officer in his or her review of and action on a permit
application under this Ordinance. Any order, requirement, decision or determination
made, or failure to act, in the enforcement of this ordinance is not appealable to the
Board of Appeals.
When the Board of Appeals reviews a decision of the Code Enforcement Officer the
Board of Appeals shall hold a “de novo” hearing. At this time the Board may receive
and consider new evidence and testimony, be it oral or written. When acting in a “de
novo” capacity the Board of Appeals shall hear and decide the matter afresh,
undertaking its own independent analysis of evidence and the law, and reaching its
own decision.
When the Board of Appeals hears a decision of the Planning Board, it shall hold an
appellate hearing, and may reverse the decision of the Planning Board only upon
finding that the decision was contrary to specific provisions of the Ordinance or
contrary to the facts presented to the Planning Board. The Board of Appeals may only
review the record of the proceedings before the Planning Board. The Board of
Appeals shall not receive or consider any evidence which was not presented to the
Planning Board, but the Board of Appeals may receive and consider written or oral
arguments. If the Board of Appeals determines that the record of the Planning Board
proceedings is inadequate, the Board of Appeals may remand the matter to the
Planning Board for additional fact finding.
d. To grant variances. A variance is a setting aside of one or more requirements of
this Ordinance, and is equivalent to permission not to comply with one or more of
the provisions.
Before granting a variance, the Board of Appeals should be very careful to
determine that this Ordinance gives them the authority to grant the requested
variance and that all variance-granting requirements of Article 11 Section C. are
met.
Appeals
11-4
When granting a variance, the Board of Appeals may attach conditions provided this
Ordinance does not expressly forbid it and provided the conditions are in order to
promote substantial compliance with this Ordinance. For example, the Board of
Appeals may grant a variance subject to the condition that the applicant landscape
sufficiently to protect abutting property owners, or, in order to facilitate traffic flow
and avoid congestion, the Board of Appeals may attach conditions which determine
the location of driveways, parking areas or garages.
In all cases involving dimensional requirements, the variance, if granted, should be
the minimum distance necessary to relieve hardship. For example, if an applicant
requests a thirty (30) foot variance from a seventy-five (75) foot setback requirement
which causes undue hardship, and a fifteen (15) foot variance would relieve
hardship, the Board of Appeals should grant a fifteen (15) foot variance.
B. Appeals
1. Administrative Appeals.
To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by, or failure to act by, the Code Enforcement
Officer or Planning Board in the administration of the Ordinance. The jurisdiction shall be
limited to hearing requests for interpreting the meaning of terms which are called into
question, and to hearing a request to determine if the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning
Board acted in accordance with the procedures of this Ordinance. The Board of Appeals
shall not have the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the Code Enforcement
Officer or Planning Board with respect to any of the standards of this Ordinance.
C. Variances
Prohibited Uses. Variances shall not be granted for establishment of any uses prohibited by
this Ordinance.
Meet all Standards. The Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance unless it finds that the
proposed structure or use would meet all of the standards of this Ordinance except for the
specific provision which has created the non-conformity and from which relief is sought.
1. Except as provided in C.2. C.3. and C.4. C.5. below, the Board may grant a variance
only when strict application of the ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner’s
property would cause undue hardship. The term “undue hardship” as used in this
subsection means:
a Reasonable Return. The land in question can not yield a reasonable return
unless a variance is granted;
b. Unique Circumstances. The need for a variance is due to the unique
circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the
neighborhood;
c, Essential Character. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential
character of the locality; and
d. Action of the Applicant. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the
applicant or a prior owner.
Appeals
11-5
2. Variance from Dimensional Standards.
A variance from the dimensional standards of this Ordinance may be approved when strict
application of this Ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner’s property would cause a
“practical difficulty” and when the following conditions exist:
a. Unique Circumstances. That the need for a variance is due to the unique
circumstances of the property and not to the general condition of the neighborhood;
b. Undesirable Change. The granting of a variance will not produce an undesirable
change in the character of the neighborhood and will not unreasonably detrimentally
affect the use or market value of abutting properties;
c. Action Taken by the Petitioner. The practical difficulty is not the result of action taken
by the petitioner or a prior owner;
d. Other Feasible Alternative. No other feasible alternative to a variance is available to
the petitioner;
e. Natural Environment. The granting of a variance will not unreasonably adversely
affect the natural environment.
f. Not Within Shoreland Zone. The property is not located in whole or in part within
shoreland areas as described in 38-A, M.S.R.A., § 435.
As used in this subsection, “practical difficulty” means that the strict application of this
Ordinance to the property precludes the ability of the petitioner to pursue a use permitted in
the district in which the property is located and results in significant economic injury to the
petitioner.
As used in this subsection, “dimensional requirements” include, but are not limited to, lot
width, structure height, percent of lot coverage, and setback requirements.
3. Variance from Setback Standards for single-family dwellings
A variance from the setback requirements only, may be granted for a single-family dwelling
when strict application of this Ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner’s property would
cause undue hardship. The term “undue hardship” as used in this subsection means:
a. Unique Circumstances. The need for a variance is due to the unique
circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the
neighborhood;
b. Essential Character. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character
of the locality;
c. Action Taken by Applicant. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the
applicant or a prior owner;
d. Abutting Property. The granting of the variance will not substantially reduce the
value or impair the use of abutting property; and
e. Need. That the granting of a variance is based upon demonstrated need, not
Appeals
11-6
convenience, and no other feasible alternative is available.
A variance under this subsection is limited to setback requirements for a single-family
dwelling that is the primary year-round residence of the applicant. The variance may not
exceed twenty percent (20%) of a setback requirement and may not be granted if the
variance would cause the area of the dwelling to exceed the maximum permissible lot
coverage, except that variances of greater than twenty percent (20%) may be approved if
the petitioner has obtained the written consent of any directly affected abutting landowner,
except for minimum setbacks from a wetland or water body required within shoreland zones
by rules adopted pursuant to 38 MRSA §435 - 449 .
4. Variances - Floodplain Management.
Within Floodplain Management areas the Board of Appeals may grant a variance from the
requirements of this Ordinance consistent with state law and the following criteria:
a. Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
b. Variances shall be granted only upon:
1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2) A determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood occur, the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances;
3) A showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with other state,
federal or local laws or ordinances; and
4) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in "undue
hardship," which in this sub-section means:
a) That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a
variance is granted;
b) That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of
the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
c). That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of
the locality; and
d) That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or
a prior owner.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and the Board of Appeals may
impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary.
Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
Appeals
11-7
a. Other criteria of Article 8. Section C. 11. And this Section are met; and
b. The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Variances may be issued for the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of
Historic Structures upon the determination that:
a. The development meets the criteria of this Section A. through D. above; and,
b. The proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not preclude
the structure’s continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Any applicant who meets the criteria of this Section A. through E. shall be notified by the
Board of Appeals in writing over the signature of the Chairman of the Board of Appeals that:
a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will
result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high
as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;
b. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property;
and
c. The applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all the risks
inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes those risks and agrees to
indemnify and defend the municipality against any claims filed against it that are
related to the applicant's decision to use land located in a floodplain and that the
applicant individually releases the municipality from any claims the applicant may
have against the municipality that are related to the use of land located in a
floodplain.
5. Disability Variances
The Board of Appeals may grant a disability variance to an owner of a dwelling for the
purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or
regularly uses the dwelling. The Board of Appeals shall restrict any variance granted under
this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures
necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with the disability. The
Board of Appeals may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to
the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in or
regularly uses the dwelling. For the purposes of this subsection, a disability has the same
meaning as a physical or mental handicap under 5 M.R.S.A., § 4553 and the term “structure
necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling” is defined to include railing, wall or roof
systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
D. Appeals Procedure
1. Making an Appeal
a. Timely appeal. Any party aggrieved by a decision of the Code Enforcement Officer
or Planning Board shall file an appeal request within thirty (30) days of the decision.
b. Notice. Such appeal shall be made by filing with the Board of Appeals a written
Appeals
11-8
notice of appeal which includes:
1) Relief requested. A concise written statement indicating what relief is
requested and why it should be granted, and what Article of this Land Use
Ordinance is involved.
2) Sketch. A sketch drawn to scale showing lot lines, location of existing
buildings and structures and other physical features of the lot pertinent to the
relief sought.
3) Signature. The application must be signed by the applicant.
4) Fee. All variances and administrative appeals by an aggrieved party shall
be accompanied by a fee payable to the Town of Waldoboro as established
by the Waldoboro Board of Selectmen.
c. Additional information. Additional information deemed necessary by the Board of
Appeals to make a fair and equitable decision shall be supplied by the applicant
upon request.

Board, as appropriate, shall transmit to the Board of Appeals all of the papers
constituting the record of the decision appealed.
e. Notification of town officials. The Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the Board of
Appeals and the Planning Board of the request. The Code Enforcement Officer
shall advertise the appeals request in the local newspaper at least seven (7) days
before a hearing is scheduled, and such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days
of its request.
f. Notification of abutters. The Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the owners of
property abutting the appellant’s property and directly across the public rights-of-way
from the property for which an appeal is requested, of the nature of the request and
of the date, time and place of the public hearing thereon. Failure of any property
owner to receive a notice of a public hearing shall not necessitate another hearing or
invalidate any action by the Board of Appeals.
g. Code Enforcement Officer involvement. The Code Enforcement Officer shall attend
all hearings and may present to the Board all plans, photographs or other material
s/he deems appropriate for an understanding of the appeal.
h. Planning Board. The Board of Appeals, where it deems appropriate, may request
the Planning Board to review an appeal request and file an advisory opinion with the
Board of Appeals. Any such advisory opinion shall be requested in a timely fashion
in order that it may be read into the record at the Board of Appeals hearing.
i. Public hearing. The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on an
administrative appeal or a request for a variance within thirty-five (35) days of its
receipt of a complete written application, unless this time period is extended by the
parties.
2. Decision by Board of Appeals
a. Quorum. A majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
Appeals
11-9
deciding an appeal.
b. Majority vote. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board of
Appeals present and voting shall be necessary to reverse an order, requirement,
decision, or determination of the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board, or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter on which it is required to decide under
this Ordinance, or to effect any variation in the application of this Ordinance from its
stated terms. The Board may reverse the decision, or failure to act, of the Code
Enforcement Officer or Planning Board only upon a finding that the decision, or
failure to act, was clearly contrary to specific provisions of this Ordinance.
c. Burden of proof. The person filing the appeal shall have the burden of proof. For de
novo administrative appeals, the Board of Appeals may receive any oral or
documentary evidence but shall provide as a matter of policy for the exclusion of
irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. Every party has the right to
represent the party’s case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit
rebuttal evidence and to conduct any cross examination that is required for a full and
true disclosure of the facts.
d. Written decision. The Board of Appeals shall decide all appeals within thirty-five (35)
days after the close of the hearing, and shall issue a written decision on all appeals.
e. Findings and conclusions. The Board of Appeals shall state the reasons and basis
for its decision, including a statement of the facts found and conclusions reached by

TOWN OF WALDOBORO
ORDINANCE
RESTRICTING VEHICLE WEIGHT ON POSTED WAYS
Section 1. Purpose and Authority
The purpose of this ordinance is to prevent damage to town ways and bridges in the Town of
Waldoboro which may be caused by vehicles of excessive weight, to lessen safety hazards and
the risk of injury to the traveling public, to extend the life expectancy of town ways and bridges,
and to reduce the public expense of their maintenance and repair.
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A. §3009 and 29-A M.R.S.A. § 2395 and 2388.
Section 2. Definitions
The definitions contained in Title 29-A M.R.S.A. shall govern the construction of words contained
In this ordinance. Any words not defined therein shall be given their common and ordinary
meaning.
Section 3. Restrictions and Notices
The municipal officers may, either permanently or seasonally, impose such restrictions on the
gross registered weight of vehicles as may, in their judgment, be necessary to protect the
traveling public and prevent abuse of the highways, and designate the town ways and bridges to
which the restrictions shall apply.
Whenever notice has been posted as provided herein, no person may thereafter operate any
vehicle with a gross registered weight in excess of the restriction during any applicable time
period on any way or bridge so posted unless otherwise exempt as provided herein.
The notice shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: the name of the way or bridge,
the gross registered weight limit, the time period during which the restriction applies, the date
on which the notice was posted, and the signatures of the municipal officers.
The notice shall be conspicuously posted at each end of the restricted portion of the way or
bridge in a location clearly visible from the travel way. Whenever a restriction expires or is lifted,
the notices shall be removed wherever posted. Whenever a restriction is revised or extended,
existing notices shall be removed and replaced with new notices.
No person may remove, obscure or otherwise tamper with any notice so posted except as
provided herein.
Section 4. Exemptions
The following vehicles are exempt from this ordinance:
(a) any two-axle vehicle while delivering home heating fuel;
(b) any vehicle while engaged in highway maintenance or repair under the direction
of the State or Town of Waldoboro;
(c) any emergency vehicle (such as firefighting apparatus or ambulances) while
training or responding to an emergency;
(d) any school transportation vehicle while transporting students;
(e) any public utility vehicle while providing emergency service, repairs, or
installation; and
(f) any vehicle whose owner or operator holds a valid permit from the municipal
officers or their designee as provided herein.
Section 5. Permits
The owner or operator of any vehicle not otherwise exempt as provided herein may apply in
writing to the municipal officers or their designee for a permit to operate on a posted way or
bridge notwithstanding the restriction. The municipal officers or their designee may issue a
permit only upon all of the following findings:
(g) no other route is reasonably available to the applicant;
(h) it is a matter of economic necessity and not mere convenience that the applicant
use the way or bridge; and
(i) the applicant has tendered cash, a bond or other suitable security acceptable to
the Town in an amount sufficient, in their judgment, to repair any damage to the
way or bridge which may reasonably result from the applicant's use of same.
Even if the municipal officers or their designee make the foregoing findings, they need not issue
a permit if they determine the applicant's use of the way or bridge could reasonably be expected
to create or aggravate a safety hazard or cause substantial damage. They may also limit the
number of permits issued or outstanding as may, in their judgment, be necessary to preserve and
protect the highways.
In determining whether to issue a permit, the municipal officers or their designee shall consider
the following factors:
(j) the gross registered weight of the vehicle;
(k) the current and anticipated condition of the way or bridge;
(l) the number and frequency of vehicle trips proposed;
(m) the cost and availability of materials and equipment for repairs;
(n) the extent of use by other exempt vehicles; and
(o) such other circumstances as may, in their judgment, be relevant.
The municipal officers or their designee may issue permits subject to reasonable conditions,
including but not limited to restrictions on the actual load weight and the number or frequency
of vehicle trips, which shall be clearly noted on the permit.
Section 6. Administration and Enforcement
This ordinance shall be administered and may be enforced by the municipal officers or their duly
authorized designee (such as road commissioner, code enforcement officer or law enforcement
officer).
Section 7. Penalties
Any violation of this ordinance shall be a civil infraction subject to a fine of not less than $250.00
nor more than $1000.00. Each violation shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition to any
fine, the Town may seek restitution for the cost of repairs to any damaged way or bridge and
reasonable attorney fees and costs.
Prosecution shall be in the name of the Town of Waldoboro and shall be brought in the Maine
District Court.
Section 8. Amendments
This ordinance may be amended by the municipal officers at any properly noticed meeting.
Section 9. Severability; Effective Date
In the event any portion of this ordinance is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.
This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon enactment by the municipal officers at any
properly noticed meeting.
