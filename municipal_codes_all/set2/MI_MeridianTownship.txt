"Violation of this Code" defined. In this section "violation of this Code" means any of the following:
Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared unlawful, an offense, a violation, a civil
infraction, a municipal civil infraction, or a misdemeanor by ordinance or by rule or regulation
authorized by ordinance.
Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance or by rule or regulation
authorized by ordinance.
Failure to perform an act if the failure is prohibited or is made or declared unlawful, an
offense, a violation, civil infraction, a municipal civil infraction or a misdemeanor by ordinance
or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance.
Failure to perform duties excluded. In this section the term "violation of this Code" does not
include the failure of a Township officer or Township employee to perform an official duty unless it
is specifically provided that the failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this
section.
Municipal civil infractions. Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance, violations of this
Code are municipal civil infractions. Any violation of this Code that is declared a misdemeanor is
not a municipal civil infraction. Any person who is found responsible or admits responsibility for a
municipal civil infraction shall be subject to a civil fine and costs. The following provisions apply to
municipal civil infractions in the absence of provisions to the contrary:
The civil fine for a municipal civil infraction shall be $75 for each infraction.
Increased civil fines shall be imposed for repeated violations by a person of any requirement
or provision of any ordinance. As used in this subsection, the term "repeat offense" means a
second (or any subsequent) municipal civil infraction violation of the same requirement or
provision committed by a person within any six-month period for which the person admits
responsibility or is determined to be responsible. The increased fine for a repeat offense shall
be as follows:
The fine for any offense which is a first repeat offense shall be $150.
The fine for any offense which is a second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat
offense shall be $250.
The judge or district court magistrate shall summarily tax and determine the costs of the
action, which are not limited to the costs taxable in an ordinary civil action and may include all
expenses, direct or indirect, to which the plaintiff has been put in connection with the
municipal civil infraction, up to the entry of judgement. However, in no case shall costs of less
than $9 or more than $500 be ordered.
Schedule of civil fines. The schedule of civil fines payable to the municipal ordinance violations
bureau shall be as specified in Subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. A copy of the schedule
of fines shall be posted at the bureau.

Fines and imprisonment. A person convicted of a violation of this Code that is a misdemeanor
shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment for a period of not more than
90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment; provided, however, that a violation of this Code is
punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500, or both, if
the violation substantially corresponds to a violation of state law that is a misdemeanor for which
the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days. A person convicted of a violation of this Code
that is a misdemeanor shall be responsible for costs.
Continuing violations; separate offenses. Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance:
As to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day that the
violation continues is a separate offense.
As to other violations, each violation constitutes a separate offense.
Application to licenses, permits, or franchises. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent
suspension or revocation of a license, permit, or franchise or other administrative sanctions.
Abatement by injunctive or equitable relief. Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect
to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The
imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief or civil or quasi-judicial enforcement.
State law reference: Penalty for ordinance violations, MCL 42.21.
§ 1-9. Severability.
[Code 1974, § 31-1]
If any provision of this Code or its application to any person or circumstances is held invalid or
unconstitutional, the invalidity or unconstitutionality does not affect other provisions or applications of
this Code that can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application, and to
this end the provisions of this Code are severable.
State law reference: Severability of state statutes, MCL 8.5.
§ 1-10. Provisions deemed continuation of existing ordinances.
The provisions of this Code, insofar as they are substantially the same as legislation previously
adopted by the Township relating to the same subject matter, shall be construed as restatements and
continuations thereof and not as new enactments.
State law reference: Similar provisions as to state statutes, MCL 8.3u.
§ 1-11. Code does not affect prior offenses or rights.
Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code affects any offense or act committed or
done, any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any contract or right established before the effective
date of this Code.
The adoption of this Code does not authorize any use or the continuation of any use of a structure
or premises in violation of any Township ordinance on the effective date of this Code.

State law reference: Municipal ordinance violations bureau, MCL 600.8396.
§ 2-136. Bureau established.
[Code 1974, § 125-2]
The Township hereby establishes a municipal ordinance violations bureau ("bureau") as authorized
under the Revised Judicature Act of 1961 (MCL § 600.8396) to accept admissions of responsibility for
municipal civil infractions in response to municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by
authorized Township officials and to collect and retain civil fines and cost as prescribed by this Code or
any ordinance.
§ 2-137. Location; supervision; employees, rules, and

Township.
§ 2-138. Disposition of violations.
[Code 1974, § 125-4]
The bureau may dispose only of municipal civil infraction violations for which a fine has been
scheduled and for which a municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any
person to dispose of the violation at the bureau. Nothing in this Code shall prevent or restrict the
Township from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any
violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal civil
infraction violation at the bureau and may have the violation processed before a court of appropriate
jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the bureau shall not
prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges, and protection accorded by
law.
§ 2-139. Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility.
[Code 1974, § 125-5]
The scope of the bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of responsibility for
municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of those

committed the offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event shall the
bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an
alleged violation.

108(6) and (7) of this chapter. In addition to any other information required by this Code or other
ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the violation, the time by which the alleged violator must
appear at the bureau for the purposes of admitting or denying responsibility for the violation, the
methods by which an appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of the bureau, the
days and hours during which the bureau is open, the amount of the fines/costs scheduled for the
alleged violation, and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fines/costs within
the required time.
§ 2-141. Availability of other enforcement options.
[Code 1974, § 125-7]
Nothing in this division shall be deemed to require the Township to initiate its municipal civil infraction
ordinance enforcement activity through the issuance of an ordinance violations notice. As to each
ordinance designated as a municipal civil infraction, the Township may, at its sole discretion, proceed
directly with the issuance of municipal civil infraction citation or take such other enforcement action as
authorized by law.
§ 2-142. Records and accounting.
[Code 1974, § 125-8]
The bureau clerk or other designated Township official or employee shall retain a copy of all municipal
ordinance violations notices and shall account to the Township Board once a month or at such other
intervals as the Township Board may require concerning the number of admission and denials of
responsibility for ordinances violations within the jurisdiction of the bureau and the amount of fines or
costs collected with respect to such violations. The civil fines or costs collected shall be delivered to
the Township Treasurer at such intervals as the treasurer shall require, and shall be deposited in the
general fund of the Township.
§ 2-143. Appearance; payment of fines and costs.
[Code 1974, § 125-9]
An alleged violator receiving a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the municipal civil
infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in person, or by representation.
§ 2-144. Procedure where admission of responsibility not made
or fine not paid.
[Code 1974, § 125-10]
If an authorized Township official issues and serves a municipal ordinance violation notice and if an
admission of responsibility is not made and civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of
fines for the violation are not paid at the bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may be filed with
the district court and a copy of the citation may be served by first-class mail upon the alleged violator at
the alleged violators last known address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by §§ 8705 and 8709 of Public Act No. 236
of 1961 (MCL § 600.8705, 600.8709), but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations
stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the alleged violator how to
respond to the citation. The citation shall thereafter be processed in the manner required by law.

membership shall have geographical representation of the local unit of government to the extent
practicable. Members of the Planning Commission shall be qualified electors in the Township,
except that one Planning Commission member may be an individual who is not a qualified elector
in the Township. No member of the Planning Commission shall be an elected officer or employee
of the Township. One member may be a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The term of

to be determined by the Township Board. Such rate of compensation, if any, shall be established

Conflict of interest. Conflict of interest arises when a member or the member's relative has a direct
financial interest, positive or detrimental, in the outcome of a decision or action that the member
may take as a public official; or when a member is a part of an entity which is involved in a
business transaction with the Planning Commission; or the member is engaged in, employed by or
provides services to an entity whose mission is incompatible or in conflict with the discharge of the
member's official duties or impairs the member's independence of judgment. A member is
disqualified from voting on a matter where they have conflict of interest as defined in this section
or by a majority vote of the remaining members of the Planning Commission. Before discussing or
voting on the matter the member shall disclose the conflict of interest. Failure of a member to
disclose a known conflict of interest constitutes malfeasance in office.

citizens of the Township by requiring the registration of all rental dwelling units in the Township.

the higher standard for the protection of the public safety and health shall prevail.

Building Inspector shall demand that the violation be corrected immediately and/or the building be
vacated immediately in accordance with §§ 107, 108 and 109 of the International Property
Maintenance Code.
Undue hardships. If, in the opinion of the Chief Building Inspector, the vacating of the building
would cause undue hardship upon its tenants, but the conditions of the premises are as described
in subsection (b) of this section, the Chief Building Inspector may correct, or cause to be
corrected, the conditions which are deemed imminently dangerous to life and limb, and charge to
the owner the costs thereof in accordance with § 109 of International Property Maintenance Code.

adjoining grounds owned by the owner of the building, including but not limited to, the
maintenance of lawns, trees, and shrubs.
If the owner or party in interest fails to appear or neglects or refuses to comply with the order
issued under subsection (b) of this section, the hearing officer shall file a report of his findings and

either approve, disapprove, or modify the order. If the Township Board approves or modifies the
order, the Township Board shall take all necessary action to enforce the order. If the order is
approved or modified, the owner or party in interest shall comply with the order within 60 days

building or structure, by first class mail at the address shown on the records. If the owner or party
in interest fails to pay the cost within 30 days after mailing by the assessor of the notice of the
amount of the cost, the Township shall have a lien for the cost incurred by the Township to bring
the property into conformance of this article. The lien shall not take effect until notice of the lien is
filed or recorded as provided by law. A lien provided for in this subsection does not have priority
over previously filed or recorded liens or encumbrances. The lien for the cost shall be collected
and treated in the same manner as provided for property tax liens under the General Property Tax
Act (MCL § 211.1 et seq.).
In addition to other remedies under this article, the Township may bring an action against the

assets of the owner other than the building or structure. The Township shall have a lien for the
amount of a judgment obtained pursuant to this subsection against the owner's interest in all real
property located in this state that is owned in whole or in part by the owner of the building or
structure against whom the judgment is obtained. A lien provided for in this subsection does not
take effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded as provided by law and the lien does not have
priority over prior filed or recorded liens and encumbrances.

§ 18-1. False alarm fees.
[Code 1974, §§ 37-1—37-5; Ord. No. 2010-14, 10-26-2010]
Definitions. As used in this chapter, the terms below shall be defined as follows:
ALARMED PREMISES
Any building, property, or premises equipped with an alarm system.
ALARM SYSTEM
An assembly of equipment and devices arranged to signal the presence of a hazard requiring
urgent attention by the Police Department or Fire Department. Such signaling may be by way
of an electrical or mechanical bell, telephone apparatus, computer or internet apparatus, or
any other means by which the Police Department or Fire Department is signaled.
FALSE ALARM
The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper
installation, or the negligence of the owner or a lessee of an alarm system or of his employee
or agent. False alarm does not include an alarm:
Caused by a thunderstorm, tornado, earthquake, blizzard, or other violent condition
beyond the control of the owner or lessee of an alarm system or of their employee or
agent;
Activated by a person working on the alarm system with prior notification to the Township
Police Department or Fire Department; or
Activated by damage to public utility lines, when the affected public utility corroborates
that the damage to such lines caused the alarm.
Established. To defray the cost of responding to false alarms and to discourage the continuation of
repeat false alarms, the owner and lessee of any alarmed premises shall be jointly and severally
responsible to pay the Township fees for each occasion on which the Township Police Department
or Fire Department responds to a false alarm from the alarmed premises. The Township Board
shall establish a schedule of fees, which it may amend from time to time.
Procedure. The Police Department and Fire Department shall report, monthly, a list of false
alarms, identifying the alarmed premises and the responsible owners and lessees. The Township
shall bill each responsible owner and lessee for the amounts due. All amounts billed by the
Township under this section shall be due within 30 days after each billing. Upon the failure of the
responsible owner or lessee to pay the amounts billed in full within 30 days of billing, the Township
Treasurer shall have the right and power to add all unpaid amounts to the tax roles of the alarmed
premises as a lien, and to levy and collect such unpaid amounts in the same manner as provided
for the levy and collection of real property taxes against the alarmed premises. In addition, the
Township Treasurer may collect any overdue amounts from the owner and lessee of the alarmed
premises in any other manner permitted by law, including the filing of a collection suit in a court of
competent jurisdiction. Any overdue amounts shall bear interest at the rate set forth in the annual
schedule of fees.

the chief of the Township Police Department. Such appeal shall be in writing, shall be filed
with the Chief of Police within 30 days after written notification of the assessment is sent by

any other reason why the fee should not be paid, supporting such with adequate and
verifiable facts. The Chief of Police shall render a decision on the appeal, and shall notify the
appellant and the Township Treasurer of the decision in writing. The Chief of Police may, in
his or her discretion, waive or reduce a fine for a false alarm, based on the information
submitted.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Chief of Police made pursuant to § 18-1(d)(1)
may file a written appeal with the Township Manager within 30 days after the date of the
written decision by the Chief of Police. The Township Manager shall determine whether the
decision of the Chief of Police is supported by the documents and information in the file.
The Township Treasurer shall defer collection of the false alarm fee while any appeal is
pending; provided, however, that any interest allowed on the false alarm fee shall continue to
accrue during the appeal period.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
Any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, commercial entity, consortium, joint
venture, or other legal entity whose actions or inactions cause, in whole or in part, an incident
involving a below ground, collapsed trench, structural collapse, confined space, high angle or
other complex rescue situation or terrorist act as defined in this section.
TERRORIST ACT
Conduct utilizing terror, intimidation, violence or the threat of violence to commit or aid in the
commission of an unlawful act including, but not limited to, hijacking, assassination, and the use of
explosives, biological or chemical agents to endanger persons or property.
§ 18-13. Findings and purpose.
[Ord. No. 2003-04, 4-1-2003]
The Township finds that a significant and continuous potential exists for incidents involving a below
ground, collapsed trench, structural collapse, confined space, high angle or other complex rescue
situation or a terrorist act that will place a substantial financial and operational burden upon police, fire
fighting, rescue, and emergency medical services. The Township finds that this article is necessary to
fairly allocate the costs resulting from such incidents among those responsible for them. The Township
further finds that this article is necessary to establish a policy and set forth the methods by which it
may recover costs incurred in making appropriate responses and providing services in connection with
same, pursuant to state law, including Public Act 33 of 1951, being MCL § 41.801 et seq.
§ 18-14. Liability for assessable costs.
[Ord. No. 2003-04, 4-1-2003]
The Township may recover all assessable costs relating to an incident involving a below ground,
collapsed trench, structural collapse, confined space, high angle or other complex rescue situation
or a terrorist act from any or all responsible parties jointly or severally.
The Township Supervisor, or the Supervisor's designee, shall determine the total assessable costs
and shall, in consultation with other Township personnel involved in responding to the incident for
which cost recovery may be sought, determine whether to assess all or part of such costs against
any responsible party. The factors considered in making such a determination include, but are not
limited to, the following:
The total assessable costs.
The risk the incident presented to the Township, its residents, and their property.
Whether the incident resulted in any injury or damage to person or property, and the extent of
such injury or damage.
The extent to which the incident required an unusual or extraordinary use of Township
personnel and equipment.
Whether the incident resulted in any damage to the environment and the extent of such
damage.
Such other factors as the Township deems appropriate.
Assessable costs may be allocated among and between responsible parties, including allocating
all or some assessable costs jointly and severally against more than one responsible party,
regardless of whether a responsible party has liability for those costs in addition to that imposed
by this article.

§ 22-27. Findings and purpose.
[Code 1974, § 120-1]
The Township finds that a significant potential exists for police and Fire Department responses to
incidents involving the release or threatened release of hazardous materials. Such incidents create a
great likelihood of personal injury and/or property damage. The control and abatement of such
incidents places a significant financial and operational burden upon a Township's police, firefighting,
rescue and emergency medical services. The Township finds that this article is necessary to establish
the liability for such incidents and to establish a policy and methods which will allow the Township to
seek recovery of Township costs associated with emergency responses to hazardous material
incidents.
§ 22-28. Hazardous materials incidents policy.
[Code 1974, § 120-3]
If Township employees are dispatched to a hazardous materials incident, the Township employee
in charge shall notify the responsible parties, including appropriate state and federal agencies, as
soon as possible. Township personnel shall make efforts to limit the Township's action to those
necessary to address dangers from fire or the imminent threat of fire or the imminent threat from
any hazardous material and necessary evacuation of affected persons.
Except for procedures necessitated by fire or the imminent threat of fire resulting from a
hazardous materials incident, Township officials are not authorized to incur any obligations,
financial or otherwise, to the Township in regards to the mitigation of impacts resulting from a
hazardous materials incident.
All Township personnel shall take appropriate steps for a hazardous materials response that
conforms to their level of training and as appropriate to the supplies and equipment to them, in
accordance with established protocols and procedures.
§ 22-29. Liability for expense of an emergency response.
[Code 1974, § 120-4]
Person responsible. The owner, operator, occupant, or other person responsible for the operation,
maintenance, and/or condition of any building, premises, property, or vehicle where an incident
arises which involves the release or threatened release of hazardous materials on or about such
building, premises, property, and/or vehicle shall be required to reimburse the Township for all
expenses of an emergency response to such hazardous materials incident.

Charge against person. The expense of an emergency response shall be a charge against the

is collectible by the Township in the same manner as an obligation under contract, express or
implied.
Cost recovery schedule. The Township Board may by resolution adopt a schedule of the costs
included within the expense of an emergency response. This schedule shall be available at the
office of the Township Clerk for inspection by the public during regular office hours.

the person liable for the expenses as enumerated under this article. The bill shall require full

person.
Failure to pay; procedure to recover costs. Any failure by the person described in this article as
liable or responsible for expenses of an emergency response to pay such bill within 30 days of
mailing or service of the bill shall constitute a default on such bill. In case of default, the Township
shall have the right and power to add all emergency response costs to the tax roll of such property
involved in the hazardous materials incident and to levy and collect such costs in the same
manner as provided for the levy and collection of real property taxes against such property or
premises. The Township shall also have the right to bring action in a court of competent
jurisdiction to collect such costs if the Township deems such action to be necessary.

The Township Board, upon the recommendation of the advisory board and by a twothirds
majority vote of the Township Board membership, may submit to the voters of the
Township a proposition to approve of the disposition of a property interest acquired

account for the sole purpose of fulfilling the intent of the original land preservation millage.
Appropriate expenditures of such funds after dissolution of the land preservation program include

stewardship responsibilities of land previously enrolled in the land preservation program.

Township Board, the advisory board may order appraisals, title work, and surveys for the property
interest recommended for acquisition and may undertake negotiations with the property owner to
arrive at an agreed upon compensation consistent with the rules of procedure. No appraisal shall
be required by the advisory board for donated property.

§ 22-117. Findings.
[Code 1974, § 105-1; Ord. No. 2002-02, 3-19-2002]
The Township Board finds that wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources that
provide many public benefits, including maintenance of water quality through nutrient cycling and
sediment trapping as well as flood and stormwater runoff control through temporary water storage,
slow release, and groundwater recharge. In addition, wetlands provide open space; passive
outdoor recreation opportunities; fish and wildlife habitat for many forms of wildlife, including
migratory waterfowl, and rare, threatened or endangered wildlife and plant species; and pollution
treatment by serving as biological and chemical oxidation basins.
Preservation of the remaining Township wetlands in a natural condition shall be and is necessary
to maintain hydrological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic natural resource values for existing
and future residents of the Township, and, therefore, the Township Board declares a policy of no
net loss of wetlands. Furthermore, the Township Board declares a long-term goal of net gain of
wetlands to be accomplished through review of degraded or destroyed wetlands in the Township
and, through cooperative work with landowners, using incentives and voluntary agreements to
restore wetlands.
Pursuant to Article 4, § 52 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan, the conservation and
development of natural resources of the state is a matter of paramount public concern in the
interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people. Therefore, with authority from
§ 30307(4) of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (MCL § 324.30307 et
seq.), the Township Board finds that this article is essential to the long-term health, safety,
economic, and general welfare of the people of the Township and to the furtherance of the policies
set forth in Part 17 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (MCL § 324.101 et

The wetland provides sources of nutrients in water food cycles and nursery grounds and
sanctuaries for fish.
The Township environmental consultant's report shall be forwarded to the Township Board, which
shall determine whether a wetland use permit application meeting the requirements of § 22-154
shall be required, based on a finding that the wetland is essential to the preservation of the natural
resources of the Township. Such determination shall be based on a finding that one or more of the
criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section are met.
If the Township Board determines that the wetland is not essential to the preservation of the
natural resources of the Township, the Township Board's decision shall be so noted on the
Township wetland inventory map at the time it is amended. The requested activity shall be
approved subject to all other applicable laws and regulations.
When a wetland under two acres in size has been determined to be essential to the natural
resources of the Township and the Township has found that one or more of the criteria set forth in
subsection (a) of this section exist at the site, the Township shall notify the applicant in writing,
stating the reasons for determining the wetland to be essential to the preservation of the natural
resources.
After determining that a wetland less than two acres in size is essential to the preservation of the
natural resources of the Township, the wetland use permit application shall be reviewed according
to the standards in § 22-157.
§ 22-157. Review standards for wetland use permits.
[Code 1974, § 105-13; Ord. No. 2002-07, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2011-04, 3-15-2011]
The criteria to evaluate wetland use permits under this division and to determine whether a permit is
granted are as follows:
A permit for any activity listed in § 22-151 shall not be approved unless the proposed activity is in
the public interest, the permit is necessary to realize the benefits derived from the activity, and the
proposed activity is otherwise lawful in all respects. Public input shall be evaluated in approving,
approving with conditions, or denying the application. The reasonable use of the property involved
in accordance with applicable local ordinances and state law shall also be considered.
In determining whether the proposed activity is in the public interest, the benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposed activity shall be balanced against the reasonably
foreseeable detriments of the activity. The decision shall reflect the national, state, and local
concern for the protection of natural resources from pollution, impairment, and destruction. The
following general criteria shall be considered:
The relative extent of the public and private need for the proposed activity.
The availability of feasible and prudent alternative locations and methods to accomplish the
expected benefits from the activity.
The extent and permanence of the beneficial or detrimental effects which the proposed
activity may have on the public and private uses to which the area is suited, including the
benefits the wetlands provide.
The probable impact of each proposal in relation to the cumulative effect created by other
existing and anticipated activities in the watershed.
The probable impact on recognized historic, cultural, scenic, ecological, or recreational values
and on the public health or safety, or fish or wildlife.

Economic value, both public and private, of the proposed land change to the general
Township area.
The size and quality of the wetland being considered.
The findings of necessity for the proposed activity which have been made by other agencies.
Amount of wetland remaining in the general area and proximity to a waterway.
Proximity to any water body.
Extent to which upland soil erosion adjacent to the protected wetland is controlled.
A wetland use permit shall not be issued unless it is shown that an unacceptable disruption will not
result to the aquatic resources. In determining whether a disruption to the aquatic resources is
unacceptable, the benefits outlined in § 22-117 and the criteria set forth in subsection (2) of this
section shall be considered. A permit shall not be issued unless the applicant also shows either of
the following:
The proposed activity is primarily dependent upon being located in the wetland; or
A feasible and prudent alternative does not exist.
Failure to submit a complete application may be reason for denial of a wetland use permit.
While determining the expected benefits of a proposed wetland use permit and its alternatives, an
area not presently owned by the applicant which could reasonably be obtained, utilized,
expanded, or managed in order to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed activity may be
considered as a feasible and prudent alternative for permitted activities.
An alternative that entails higher costs, as described in R281.922a(11) of the Michigan
Administrative Code is not feasible and prudent if those higher costs are unreasonable. In
determining whether such costs are unreasonable, the Director of Community Planning and
Development, Planning Commission, or Township Board whichever is applicable shall consider
both of the following:
The relation of the increased cost to the overall scope and cost of the project.
Whether the projected cost is substantially greater than the costs normally associated with the
particular type of project.
Following approval of the application, a wetland use permit shall be issued upon determination
that all other requirements of the ordinance and law have been met, including site plan, plat or
land use approval, as applicable, and including issuance of a permit by the state department of
environmental quality if required under MCL § 324.30301 et seq. In cases where a state
department of environmental quality permit allows activities not permitted by the wetland use
permit approval granted under this section, the restrictions of the approval granted under this
section shall govern.
§ 22-158. Consideration of wetland mitigation proposals.

environmental consultant's recommendation as part of the wetland use permit review process. A
mitigation plan, if required, shall be approved as part of the wetland use permit decision. Mitigation
shall not be considered a substitute for making all prudent attempts to avoid wetland impacts.
Prior to considering a proposal for wetland mitigation, it must be shown that it is practical to
replace the wetland resource values which will be impacted, including flood prevention, wildlife
habitat, groundwater resource protection and recharge, pollution treatment, erosion control,
nutrient sources, aesthetics, recreation, open space and any other values identified.
If determined by the Township environmental consultant that the requirements of subsection (1) of
this section are met, the following criteria shall be considered when reviewing an applicant's
mitigation proposal:
Mitigation shall be provided on site where practical and beneficial to the wetland resources. If
on-site mitigation is not practical and beneficial, then mitigation in the immediate vicinity,
within the same watershed of the permitted activity may be considered. Only if all of these
options are impractical shall mitigation be considered elsewhere.
Any proposal shall ensure that there will be no net loss to the wetland resource values.
The mitigation plan must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
A plan to monitor preserved and replacement wetlands.
Wetland mitigation and monitoring plans shall become conditions to the wetland use permit and
shall be the responsibility of the applicant or its successors.
Financial assurances that mitigation is accomplished as specified by the permit condition may be
required by the Director of Community Planning and Development, Planning Commission, or
Township Board, as applicable.
Any mitigation activity shall be completed before initiation of other permitted activities, unless a
phased concurrent schedule can be agreed upon between the Director of Community Planning
and Development, Planning Commission, or Township Board, as applicable, and the applicant.
Wetland mitigation plans that create less than two acre wetlands shall meet one of the conditions
listed in Subsection 22-156(a).

The Director of Community Planning and Development, Planning Commission, or Township
Board, as applicable, shall attach any reasonable conditions considered necessary to ensure that
the intent of this article will be fulfilled, to minimize or mitigate damage or impairment to,
encroachment in, or interference with natural resources and processes within the protected
wetland, or to otherwise improve or maintain the water quality.
The Director of Community Planning and Development, Planning Commission, or Township Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the undertaking and completion of all activities and structures, as
applicable.
Following the approval of the wetland use permit application, a permit shall be issued upon
determination that all other requirements of the ordinance and law have been met, including site
plan, plat or land use approvals, as applicable, and including issuance of required permits by the
county or the state department of environmental quality under part 303 of the Natural Resources

§ 22-171. Findings.
[Ord. No. 2002-12, 10-15-2002]
The Township Board of the Charter Township of Meridian finds the following:
Regulation of the removal or alteration of trees; forest resources; other forms of existing
vegetation and topography will protect important physical, aesthetic, recreational and economic
assets for both present and future generations of the Charter Township of Meridian; and
Trees, forest resources and other forms of existing vegetation are essential components to the
general welfare of the Township by providing natural beauty, natural character, recreational
opportunities, and wildlife habitat and by protecting public health through the absorption of
airborne pollutants and generation of oxygen, through the reduction of excessive noise pollution,
through their cooling properties in the summer months and through their root systems, stabilizing
the soil, playing an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood
control; and
Disturbance of or alteration of existing topography impacts drainage ways which can contribute to
erosion and damage to adjacent properties if undertaken without site review prior to the
disturbance or alteration to assure that proper measures are installed to prevent or reduce erosion
or damage; and
In order to assure the assessment of parcels, in compliance with the Meridian Township Code of
Ordinances, parcels must remain undisturbed by clearing, grading and removal of vegetation prior
to the review and issuance of permits, approvals, special use permits or variances.
§ 22-172. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 2002-12, 10-15-2002]
The purpose of this article is to provide:
For the protection, preservation, and use of trees, forest resources, and other forms of existing

barriers. Barriers will be required for all trees being protected. Property areas separate from the
construction or land-clearing area into which no equipment will venture shall be ribboned off.
The following methods of tree protection shall be used during construction:
The root zone should be protected from compaction by fencing this area around the tree. The
dripline should be fenced if space does not allow the entire root zone to be protected. If the
area inside the dripline must be affected, an arborist needs to be consulted to consider
alternate construction methods, provide remedial treatment to the tree, and determine the
minimum space allowable. The amount of soil area the tree requires to survive is determined

by the age, health and species. At a minimum, "protective fencing" should consist of a metal
chain link or wire farm fence or wood four by four posts with two by six cross pieces
constructed as noted in Figure 1. No activity shall be conducted within the area of protective
fencing of any tree designated to be retained.
Figure 1 — Tree Protection
When determined by the arborist, as necessary, wood chips (mulch) with a minimum depth of
four to six inches are to be placed under all protected trees before construction begins. Wood
chips should start a foot from the trunk and extend to the dripline to prevent compaction
should a vehicle violate the protective fence. Wood chips shall be left in place after
construction.
Trenching or digging in the root zone of a tree shall be avoided. Directional boring machines
shall be used instead of trenching to install gas and electrical lines where feasible.
Roads and driveways shall be located as far from trees as possible. If a temporary drive is
needed in the root zone, up to 12 inches of wood chips shall be used as base for the
equipment to drive on.
Water and fertilization needs of the trees are to be monitored during and after construction.
§ 22-180. Enforcement and penalties.
[Ord. No. 2002-12, 10-15-2002]
Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be responsible for a municipal civil
infraction. The municipal civil infraction is subject to issuance and sanctions as provided by § 1-8

of this Code.
In addition to the penalties provided for in this section, any person who violates any provision of
this article shall forfeit and pay to the Township a civil penalty of $350 per inch d.b.h. of each tree
removed in violation of this article. Such sum shall accrue to the Township and may be recovered
in a civil action brought by the Township. Replacement of illegally removed trees and vegetation
may be required as restoration in lieu of money. This replacement will be computed on an inch-forinch
ratio based on the total diameter measured at d.b.h. in inches of the illegally removed trees
and restoration of vegetation. If, because of destruction of the removed trees, exact inch-for-inch
measurements cannot be obtained, the Township may use other means to estimate the tree loss.
A combination of money and tree replacement may be required.
Any use or activity in violation of the terms of this article is hereby declared to be a nuisance per
se, and may be abated by order of any court of competent jurisdiction. The Township Board, in
addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, abate or
restrain the violation. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such action shall be
assessed as damages against the violator.
If activities are conducted contrary to the provisions of this article or other applicable laws or
ordinances, the Director of Community Planning and Development shall give written notice to the
person conducting the activity, notifying him of the violation of this article, or other applicable law
or ordinance, ordering that the activity be stopped, and to appear and show cause why the activity
should not be stopped. If the person conducting the activity fails to appear and show good cause
within one full workday after notice is delivered, the Director of Community Planning and
Development shall cause a written order to stop the activity to be posted on the premises. A
person shall not continue, or cause or allow to be continued, activity in violation of an order to
stop, except with permission of the director to abate a dangerous condition or remove the
violation, or except by court order. If an order to stop is not obeyed, the Township may apply to the
circuit court for the county in which the premises are located for an order enjoining the violation of
the order. This remedy is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy provided by law
or ordinance, and does not prevent criminal prosecution for failure to obey the order.
Any person violating the provisions of this article shall become liable to the Township for any
expense or loss or damage occasioned by the Township by reason of such violation including, but
not limited to, actual attorneys fees, filing fees and witness fees.

[Ord. No. 2010-01, 3-23-2010]
A permit shall not be issued unless the permittee shall first post with the Township a bond executed by
the landowner and a corporate surety with authority to do business in the State of Michigan as a surety
or other security as may be required by this section.
The bond shall be in a form approved by the Township, payable to the Township and in the amount of
the estimated total cost of all temporary and permanent soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures, and an amount sufficient to assure installation and completion of corrective measures. The
total cost shall be estimated by the applicant and reviewed by the department. The bond shall include
provisions for failure to complete the work on schedule as specified on the permit. In lieu of a surety
bond, the applicant may file with the Township an irrevocable letter of credit in a form approved by the
Township's attorney or cash deposit in the amount equal to that which would be required for the surety
bond.
Every bond and instrument of credit shall include and every cash deposit shall be made conditioned
upon the permittee's compliance with all of the provisions of this article and all of the terms and
conditions of the permit, and completion of all work contemplated under the permit within the time limit
specified in the permit or temporary certificate of occupancy, or, if no time limit is specified, within 180
days after the date of the issuance of the permit.
For minor projects and the construction of new single-family residential homes, the director or other
designated person within the department may waive financial guarantees that would otherwise be
required by this section. In addition, the director may waiver or reduce the financial guarantee
otherwise required by this section if the director determines that the size and scope of the work is such
that the furnishing of such financial guarantee would be disproportionately costly or unduly
burdensome to the permittee. Waiver or reduction of financial guarantees otherwise required by this
section shall not relieve the permittee of compliance with the terms of the permit or this article, nor
shall such waiver be construed to limit the Township's enforcement options whatsoever.
§ 22-206. Extension of time.
[Ord. No. 2010-01, 3-23-2010]
If the permittee is unable to complete the work within the specified time, the permittee may, at least 10
days prior to the expiration of the permit, present in writing to the department a request for an
extension of time setting forth the reasons for the requested extension. If an extension is warranted,
the department may grant a permit extension with a new expiration date for the completion of the work,
but no such extension shall release the owner or surety on the bond or the person furnishing the
instrument of credit or cash bond.
§ 22-207. Failure to complete work.
[Ord. No. 2010-01, 3-23-2010]

[Code 1974, § 65-1; amended 2-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-03]
The Township Board finds that the interests of the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of

other public services regularly provided in this Township.
§ 38-188. Waiver.
[Code 1974, § 65-10]
The sponsor of the outdoor assembly may petition the Township Board for a waiver of one or more of
the requirements for licensing under this article. Upon receipt of such petition, if it appears to the
Township Board that one or more requirements of this article creates an unnecessary hardship, not
created by action of the sponsor, or that a genuine hardship exists because of unusual circumstances
with regard to the particular activity, such requirement or requirements may be waived. The
requirement of a license may not be waived.
§ 38-189. Violations.
[Code 1974, § 65-12; Ord. No. 2003-02, 1-7-2003; amended 2-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-03]
It shall be unlawful for a licensee or a licensee's employee or agent, to knowingly:
Advertise, promote or sell tickets to, conduct or operate an assembly without first obtaining a

Permit any person on the premises to cause or create a disturbance in, around, or near the

premises.
Permit any person to unlawfully use, sell or possess any narcotics, narcotic drugs, drugs or other
controlled substances as defined by state or federal law.
§ 38-190. Civil infraction.
[Added 2-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-03]
Any person or other entity who causes or permits to continue any assembly as prohibited by this article
is responsible for a municipal civil infraction as defined by Michigan law and is subject to a civil fine of
not more than $500, plus costs, which may include all direct or indirect expenses which the Township
has incurred in connection with the violation, including attorneys' fees. A violator of this article shall
also be subject to such additional sanctions, remedies, and judicial orders as are authorized under
Michigan law. Each day a violation of this article continues to exist constitutes a separate violation. The
foregoing civil fines shall not prohibit the Township from seeking injunctive relief against a violator or
such other appropriate relief as may be provided by law.

Luminaires with lumens between 1,000 and 3,500 shall be fully shielded so that direct light is not
emitted at angles above the horizontal plane of the lowest direct-light emitting part of the luminaire
(see Figure 2). Luminaires with lumens of more than 3,500 shall be shielded with sharp cut-off or
full cut-off fixtures (see Figure 1).
Outdoor lighting regulated by this article shall incorporate shielding features such as, but not
limited to baffles, louvers, caps, shrouds, barn doors, house shields, or hoods to prevent direct
glare, light trespass, and sky glow.
Luminaires shall be designed and located to direct light away from adjoining and nearby properties
and shall not exceed a maximum of one footcandle at the property line.
Floodlights and spotlights mounted on a pole or on a building shall be designed, shielded, installed
and maintained in a manner that directs the light downward and away from adjacent properties
and streets. The floodlight or spotlight shall be aimed no higher than 20° measured from the
vertical line between the fixture and the ground (see Figure 3). The total lamp output shall not
exceed 1,500 lumens per fixture.
Whenever practicable, outdoor lighting systems shall include timers, motion detectors, dimmers,
and/or sensors to reduce overall energy consumption and eliminate unnecessary lighting.
Landscape lighting shall have wattage equal to or less than 60 watts or 3,200 lumens per fixture,
shall be mounted in or at grade (not to exceed three feet above grade) and used solely for
landscape lighting.
The maximum height above the adjacent grade for luminaires, including the pole and pole base,
shall not exceed 30 feet, except the maximum height for street lights in residential developments
shall not exceed 20 feet.
Unless otherwise required by the FCC or FAA, towers or other structures requiring obstruction
lighting at night shall generate the minimum lumens necessary, oscillating red in color.
Flag illumination must have narrow spot distribution so that light illuminates only the flagpole and
the flag. In any residential zoning district, the maximum lumen output is 1,500 lumens and in any
other zoning district, the maximum lumen output is 9,000 lumens. Flags are encouraged to be
taken down at sunset to avoid the need for lighting.
Regulated luminaires requiring shielding shall not employ flexible or adjustable mounting systems.
All nonessential commercial and nonresidential outdoor lighting is encouraged to be turned off
after business hours and/or when not in use. Essential outdoor lighting includes lighting
associated with safety, security, and flag display.
New outdoor recreation facilities must conform to the requirements of this ordinance except when
shielding requirements would interfere with the intended activity, as determined by the Director of
Community Planning and Development. Lighting must be off during times when not in use.
All luminaires that are within a distance of 2 1/2 times its mounting height from the property line
when adjoining residential property shall be properly shielded.
No wall-mounted luminaire, or a luminaire installed under a canopy, soffit, overhang or roof eave
shall exceed 9,000 lumens per fixture.
Wall-mounted decorative or architectural lighting shall be fully shielded and directed downward
and shall not exceed 6,500 lumens per fixture.

§ 38-380. Light output standards.
[Ord. No. 2007-03, 4-24-2007; Ord. No. 2010-09, 8-1-2010]
The total amount of light, measured in lumens, from all lamps used in light fixtures shall not exceed the
limits in Table 1. The initial lamp output, as defined by the manufacturer, is the value to be considered.
For determining compliance with Table 1, the light emitted from lamps in light fixtures is to be included
as follows:
Outdoor luminaires on poles or installed on buildings or structures shall be included in the total by
adding the lumen output of the lamp.
Luminaires installed under canopies, soffitts, overhangs or roof eaves where all parts of the
luminaire are located at least five feet from the nearest edge of the canopy or overhang, are to be
included as though they produce only one-quarter of the lamp's initial lumen output.
The values in Table 1 are maximums and not design goals; design goals should be the lowest
levels that meet the requirements of the task.

A conditional approval does not prevent the Director of Community Planning and
Development from requesting additional documentation, as required or permitted under this
chapter.
Lottery; order of special use permit applications.
After all applications have been either granted conditional approval or denied, the Director of
Community Planning and Development shall then sort the applications by the type of facility
permit requested.
Each conditionally approved application will be entered in a lottery by facility type to
determine which applications may submit special use permit applications. Each facility type
shall be drawn by random lottery as follows:
For provisioning centers, the applications shall be additionally sorted by their zoning
overlay area. For each overlay area, the Director of Community Planning and
Development shall randomly draw the name or number of each provisioning center
applicant until all conditionally approved applications are drawn in each overlay area. The
applicant of each first provisioning center drawn in each overlay area may then apply for
a special use permit. If any bonus second provisioning center is available under § 40-
28(b)(6), then each overlay area with more than one conditionally approved provisioning
center application shall itself be drawn by random lottery until all bonus second
provisioning center overlay areas have been awarded. The applicant of each second
provisioning center drawn in each overlay area awarded a bonus may then apply for a
special use permit.
For each other facility type, the Director of Community Planning and Development shall
randomly draw the name or number of the applicants until all conditionally approved
applications are drawn.
The number of special use permit applications submitted may not exceed the number of
available permits under this chapter. In each facility type, the number of applicants drawn
equal to the available permits under this chapter at the time of the lottery may apply for a
special use permit. Applicants drawn after the number of available permits will retain that
lottery position as provided in this chapter.
The Director of Community Planning and Development shall maintain a record of the
lottery results and order of drawing for each facility type until December 31 of the year in
which the lottery occurred. Lottery positions do not confer any right to a permit under this
chapter.
All lottery drawings shall be conducted publicly by the Director of Community Planning
and Development with the date and time published on the Township's website and all
entrants provided notice.
All special use permit applications must be submitted within 60 days of the lottery or notice
under this subsection. If the applicant does not submit a special use permit application or a
special use permit is denied and all appeals are exhausted, then the Director of Community
Planning and Development may consult the lottery results and notify the next applicant that
they may apply for a special use permit.
Renewal application. The same requirements that apply to all new applications for a permit,
except for special use permit and lottery requirements, shall apply to all renewal applications.
Renewal applications shall be submitted to and received by the Director of Community Planning
and Development not less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the annual permit, except that an
application requesting a change in the location of the permitted premises shall be submitted and
received not less than 120 days prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit holder whose permit
expires and for which a complete renewal application has not been received by the expiration date

renewal applications after the expiration date of the permit.
Issuance of commercial medical marihuana facilities permit.
An inspection of the proposed commercial medical marihuana facility by the Township shall
be required prior to issuance of the permit. Such inspection shall occur after the premises are
ready for operation, but prior to the stocking of the business with any medical marihuana, and
prior to the opening of the business or commencement of operations. The inspection is to
verify that the business facilities are constructed and can be operated in accordance with the
application submitted and the applicable requirements of this chapter, the special use permit,
and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation.
After verification the facilities are constructed and can be operated in accordance with the
application submitted and the applicable requirements of this chapter, the special use permit,
and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation, and the issuance of a permanent certificate
of occupancy for the facility, the Director of Community Planning and Development shall issue
the permit for a term of one year.
Maintaining a valid license is a condition for the issuance and maintenance of the permit
issued under this chapter and the continued operation of any marihuana facility.
An applicant or permit holder has a duty to notify the Director of Community Planning and
Development in writing of any pending criminal charge, and any criminal conviction of a felony
or other offense involving a crime of moral turpitude by the applicant, any owner, principal
officer, director, manager, or employee within 10 days of the event.
An applicant or permit holder has a duty to notify the Director of Community Planning and
Development in writing of any pending criminal charge, and any criminal conviction, whether a
felony, misdemeanor, petty offense, or any violation of a local law related to the cultivation,
processing, manufacture, storage, sale, distribution, testing or consumption of any form of
marihuana, the MMMA, the MMFLA, any building, fire, health or zoning statute, code or
ordinance related to the cultivation, processing, manufacture, storage, sale, distribution,
testing or consumption of any form of marihuana by the applicant, any owner, principal officer,
director, manager, or employee within 10 days of the event.

commercial medical marihuana facility permit whose building is not yet in existence at the time of
the Township's initial approval shall have one year immediately following the date of the
Township's initial approval to complete construction of the building, in accordance with applicable
zoning ordinances, building codes, and any other applicable state or local laws, rules or
regulations, and to commence business operations.
Duty to supplement. If, at any time before or after a permit is issued pursuant to this chapter, any
information required in the application, the MMFLA, or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder, changes in any way from that which is stated in the application, the applicant or
licensee shall supplement such information in writing within 10 days from the date upon which
such change occurs.
Permit forfeiture. In the event that a commercial medical marihuana facility does not commence
operations within one year of issuance of a Township permit, the permit shall be deemed forfeited;
the facility may not commence operations and the permit is not eligible for renewal.

Article III. Recreational Marihuana Establishments
[Adopted by Ord. No. 2019-11, 7-9-2019]
§ 40-51. Title.
This article shall be known as and may be cited as the "Charter Township of Meridian Prohibition of
Recreational Marihuana Establishments Ordinance."
§ 40-52. Intent and purpose.
The State of Michigan, by voter referendum of November 2018, approved the use and possession
of recreational marihuana by individuals over the age of 21. The law also established at least six
commercial recreational marihuana licensed establishments that may operate, subject to State of
Michigan and Township prohibition or regulation. This law has been identified as the Michigan
Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, MCLA § 333.27951 et seq. ("MRTMA"), as amended.
The Township determines that the general purposes of this article are as follows:
The citizens of Meridian Township voted for the MRTMA with a vote of approximately 75.5%
in favor and 24.5% opposed, indicating support of at least some of the activities and uses
allowed under the MRTMA.
Legitimate concerns remain regarding the proper regulation of recreational marihuana
establishments, either distinct from medical marihuana facilities allowed under the Michigan
Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act,[1] or combined with such facilities.
Editor's Note: See MCLA § 333.27101 et seq.
Certain provisions of the MRTMA create ambiguity as to potential impacts upon the Township.
The State of Michigan is charged with promulgating rules to give further effect to the MRTMA
and potentially address ambiguities in the MRTMA, but the State of Michigan has up to a year
before such rules will be available for review and study by the Township.
The Township is concerned that proper regulation must be carefully studied and considered to
address the MRTMA's impacts before allowing any commercial recreational marihuana
establishments within the Township.
The Township Board determines that the adoption of this article is necessary to preserve the
public peace, health and safety by preventing the establishment of businesses related to
recreational marihuana without proper time for the Township to study the new state law and
properly determine how to effectuate appropriate regulation regarding it.
§ 40-53. Definitions.
Words used within this article shall be construed to have the same meanings as provided in the
MRTMA.

Lots within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards:
General lot arrangement.
Every lot or outlot shall front on and have direct access to a public street.
Side lot lines shall be generally at right angles or radial to the street rights-of-way. A greater
degree of variation may be permitted where such lot lines would create irregularly shaped lots
which would unreasonably limit construction, or where adjustments to the standard lot
configuration would protect regulated wetlands or preserve other natural features.
Residential lots shall not face such features as freeways, arterial streets, collector streets,
shopping centers, or industrial properties.
Lots shall have a front-to-front relationship across all streets where possible.
Through lots shall be prohibited.
Lots facing a three-way intersection should be aligned to prevent on-coming headlight glare
into the lot or onto the structure.
Blocks shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots, except where lots back onto a
major thoroughfare, railroad, natural feature or subdivision boundary.
Access to residential lots shall be located on the street with the lowest functional classification
per § 86-367 of the Code of Ordinances.
Lots which abut an active rail line shall comply with the minimum lot depth and setback
requirements from the railroad right-of-way line as required in § 86-470 of the Code of
Ordinances.
Floodplains. No portion of any lot shall be platted into the intermediate regional floodplain.
Those portions of a plat, which are located within the intermediate regional floodplain shall be
subject to the provisions of § 86-436 of the Code of Ordinances.
Water features. The design of subdivisions shall comply with the Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Act (MCL § 324.4101 et seq., as amended), and the Meridian
Township Wetland Protection Ordinance.
Woodlands and mature trees. Woodland areas should be identified in the preparation of plans
submitted to the Township for the development of a subdivision. Significant trees or
woodlands should be identified on the tentative preliminary plat and preserved to the extent
consistent with the reasonable utilization of land.
If the plat extends into an adjacent community, boundaries for individual lots shall be within
one community.
Lot sizes and shapes.
Lot area and width. Each lot shall comply with the minimum area and width requirements of
the Code of Ordinances for the district in which the subdivision is proposed.

Lot shape. Lots should resemble rectangles but may be shaped to adapt to natural features
on the site, subject to review by the Director of Community Planning and Development. Flag
lots, irregular shaped lots, and lots with unusual shapes proposed only for the purpose of
meeting lot area or width requirements shall not be permitted.
Water features setback and natural vegetation strip. A minimum setback and natural
vegetation strip shall be maintained for structures and grading adjacent to any water feature,
including wetlands, rivers, drains, creeks and lakes, as required in the Code of Ordinances.
The proprietor shall demonstrate an adequate buildable area exists on each lot without
intruding into the required water features setback or natural vegetation strip.
Width-to-depth ratio. Narrow, deep lots shall be avoided. A depth-to-width ratio of 3:1 shall be
considered a maximum, except where the proprietor demonstrates a deeper lot will protect
natural resources, such as woodlands, wetlands, or wildlife habitat or demonstrates a deeper
lot would be a logical design for the specific location.
Building setbacks. Lots shall be of sufficient size and proportion to accommodate the
minimum required building setbacks listed in the Code of Ordinances for the district in which
the subdivision is located.
Corner lot setbacks. Corner lots shall comply with zoning standards regarding additional
depth and/or width to provide the required front yard setback along all sides facing a public
street.
Nonresidential lots. Lots intended for purposes other than residential use(s) shall be
specifically designated for such purposes, and shall have adequate provision for off-street
parking, setbacks and other requirements in accordance with the Code of Ordinances.
§ 62-62. Streets.
[Ord. No. 2006-03, 8-1-2006]
The provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum requirements for streets and intersections. If any
other public agency having jurisdiction shall adopt any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation imposing
additional, or more rigorous requirements, then the provisions of such statute, ordinance, rule or
regulations shall govern.
Compliance with Ingham County Road Commission (ICRC) and Michigan Department of
Transportation (MDOT) standards. The standards of this section are intended to comply with the
public street or road standards of the Ingham County Road Commission and the Michigan
Department of Transportation.
Relationship to natural features and grades. Streets shall be aligned to minimize impacts on
natural features and existing grades.
Continuity of street system. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
existing streets from adjacent areas into new subdivisions, unless otherwise approved by the
Township Board due to documented environmental constraints or where the abutting street system
is not deemed capable of safely handling additional traffic volumes. Where adjacent vacant areas
are zoned or planned for development similar to the proposed subdivision, streets shall be
extended to the boundary line of the tract to make provision for the future street connections. The
proprietor shall demonstrate the proposed stub street is the most reasonable location for
extension into the adjacent lands, in consideration of factors including, but not limited to grades,
water bodies, wetlands and lot configuration.
Street connections. The proposed subdivision street layout shall discourage use by through traffic,
except where a continuation of streets to adjacent properties is deemed desirable by the Township

and the Ingham County Road Commission. In determining the need for such connections, the
following issues shall be considered:
The need for adequate access for service and response time for emergency vehicles.
Adequate and convenient access for garbage pick-up, snow removal, and postal delivery
services.
School bus safety, schedules, and routing needs.
The impacts such connections may have on reducing congestion along collector streets and
arterials.
The projected traffic volumes and the compatibility with adjacent developments.
Existing streets or roads. Where a subdivision incorporates existing public streets or roads which
are not in conformance with current standards, such facilities shall be reconstructed as necessary
to improve the street or road to the extent required by the Ingham County Road Commission.
Maximum block length. The maximum block length of any street or road constructed for any phase
of a subdivision shall not be longer than 1,320 feet measured from centerline to centerline of the
intersections at each end of the block, except the Township Board may approve a plat which
varies from these dimensions upon consideration of the following:
Recommendations from the Township police and Fire Departments.
Recommendations from the Ingham County Road Commission.
Evidence the longer block length will not create a threat to public safety.
Documented evidence that significant natural features will be preserved.
To address design considerations for nonresidential subdivisions.
Cul-de-sac streets, stub streets, and loop streets. The length of cul-de-sac streets, stub streets,
and loop streets with a single point of access and egress shall not exceed 660 feet, unless a
longer street is necessary and appropriate because of topography or other natural features,
existing conditions or other circumstances as may be approved by the Township Board and the
Ingham County Road Commission.
Maximum lots on a single access. In no case shall more than 35 single-family lots be permitted
within a platted subdivision unless two means of street access are provided. The maximum
number of nonresidential lots permitted within a platted subdivision without two means of street
access shall be determined by the Township Board based on the following:
The number of lots proposed in the nonresidential plat.
The total acreage of the proposed nonresidential plat.
The estimated peak hour trip generation of the nonresidential plat at build-out.
The estimated square footage of all structures planned within the nonresidential plat.
Minimum right-of-way widths. The minimum right-of-way width for interior subdivision streets shall
be based on applicable Ingham County Road Commission standards. A greater right-of-way may
be required due to the intensity of development, the need for additional area for utilities, grading to
accommodate planned or expected street cross sections, and the expected traffic volumes and
characteristics associated with the types of uses which may access the street based on the
zoning.

Storm drainage.
An adequate storm and surface water drainage system, which may consist of storm sewers,
drain inlets, manholes, culverts, bridges, sedimentation basins, and natural and constructed
components, shall be required and shall meet requirements of the Township and the Ingham
County Drain Commissioner and shall be subject to review and approval by the Director of
Public Works and Engineering. On-site detention or retention shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Ingham County Drain Commissioner's Office and the Director of Public
Works and Engineering. The option of joint retention and detention is also available, subject
to the same review and approval process.
The system design shall not adversely affect neighboring properties and natural features, or
worsen downstream flooding and water quality. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm drainage pattern for the area.
Surface water management systems shall be designed to retain the natural function and
value of any wetland, water body, or watercourse, and to not increase flooding or the potential
for pollution of surface or groundwater, either on-site or off-site, from such pollutants as
sediment, nutrients, or toxic substances.
Existing surface water flow entering the site shall be received and discharged at the same
rate as occurred prior to the development. Both peak flow and runoff volumes shall be
maintained at predevelopment levels.
The grading of lots shall be such that surface water drains away from building foundations
and toward swales, ditches, retention areas, or drainage structures. Surface water from all
roofs and paved areas shall be collected at intervals so it will not obstruct vehicular or
pedestrian traffic and will not create nuisance ponding in paved areas.
Wetlands shall not be used for on-site detention or retention of surface water unless no other
practical alternative exists and it can be demonstrated to the Township's environmental
consultant that it will not have an adverse effect upon ecological and hydrological
characteristics of the wetland. Final preliminary plat approval shall not be granted until all
necessary wetland permits are obtained.
If the Township or the Ingham County Drain Commissioner accepts or requires stormwater
retention or detention, the maximum side slope shall not exceed a one-foot rise per four-foot
run and the outside edge of the retention or detention basin shall provide adequate space for
landscaping. A landscape plan shall be submitted for the retention or detention basin which
illustrates views of the detention/retention area will be obscured from adjacent streets or lots.
If such area borders an existing single-family residential development, landscaping shall be
installed, subject to the review and approval of the Township.
Underground wiring. The proprietor of any subdivision shall make arrangements for all telephone,
cable television and electric service lines, exclusive of main supply and perimeter feed lines when
located on section or quarter section lines, to be placed entirely underground throughout a
subdivided area; provided, however, when a subdivision overlaps a section or quarter section line,

may aid the Planning Commission and Township Board in the analysis of the proposed waiver.

application of the provisions of this chapter would clearly be impractical or unreasonable. In

requirement involved.
The granting of the specified waiver will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to
other properties in the area in which said property is situated.

amended) nor create a violation of the Code of Ordinances.

§ 70-155. Determination of gross revenues.
[Code 1974, ch. 126, app. A]
For the purpose of § 70-182(3), the definition of "applicable gross revenues" in § 70-151, and § 70-
185(b)(6), "gross revenues" means all amounts earned, received, or accrued by a permittee and its
affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, and any person in whom the permittee has a financial
interest or revenues received by the permittee from a person with whom the permittee has a revenueproducing
agreement, in whatever form and from all sources which are in connection with or
attributable to the permittee's telecommunications system in the Township or to the permittee's or its
affiliates' provision of telecommunications services within the Township.
Gross revenues shall include, but not be limited to, all revenues from or attributable to customers,
other carriers, or third parties whether for services, equipment, directories, publications, or
otherwise. It shall include revenues of the types generally described in the revenue accounts of
the FCC Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies as in effect on October

CFR 32.27 as in effect on October 31, 1996, including in particular 47 CFR 32.27(d), and
otherwise at the fair market rate.
Gross revenues shall include all amounts received, earned, or accrued during a period regardless
of whether:
Received or not in the case of amounts earned or accrued;
The amounts are to be paid in cash, in trade, or by means of some other benefit to the
permittee or its affiliates;
The goods or services with which the revenue is associated are provided at cost or the
revenue amount can be matched against an equivalent expenditure;
The amounts are characterized, separately identified, or accounted as being for goods,
services, or fees to be paid to units of government or government agencies; or
The amounts are initially recorded or received by the permittee or by an affiliate.
However, gross revenues shall exclude uncollectible accounts during the period, computed
on a fair basis consistently applied.
Gross revenues shall be computed at the level where first received from an entity not in any way
affiliated with the permittee and shall not be net of any operating expense, any accrual, including
without limitation, any accrual for commissions, or any other expenditure.
Revenues from customers shall be allocated to the Township based upon whether or not the
location being provided service pursuant to the permit is located in the Township and not by any
other allocation method. Revenues from nonswitched telecommunications services shall be
allocated to the Township as set forth in § 70-156.
Revenues whose source cannot be identified with a specific customer or Township shall be
allocated to the Township based upon the percentage of customers in the Township compared to
the number of customers served by that portion of the permittee's telecommunications system,
including portions outside the Township, to which such revenues are reasonably attributable.
§ 70-156. Allocation of revenue from nonswitched
telecommunications services.
[Code 1974, ch. 126, app. A-1]
Gross revenues from nonswitched telecommunications services shall be allocated to the Township as
follows:
For purposes of this section, the term "nonswitched telecommunications services" means the twoway
transmission of high speed digital voice, data, and, for such applications as teleconferencing,
video signals to carry interexchange traffic between long distance carrier points-of-presence, to
interconnect user locations to interexchange carrier points-of-presence, and to interconnect user
locations.
If the locations of a given customer receiving service from the permittee are in the Township, gross
revenues shall include all revenues received from or imputed to that customer.
If any but not all of the locations of a given customer receiving service from the permittee are in
the Township, the revenues attributable to the Township shall be computed separately for each
service taken by the customer. For each separate service taken, the revenues attributable to the
Township are all revenues received from or imputed to that service times a fraction whose

numerator is the number of locations of the customer within the Township taking that service and
whose denominator is all the customer's locations taking that service.
If, such as with an interexchange carrier which contracts for capacity from the permittee so as to
connect with its customers through the permittee's telecommunications system, a customer uses
the permittee's telecommunications system to connect to third parties, such third parties shall be
treated as customers or customer locations, as the case may be, for purposes of this provision
and revenue attribution thereunder. The term "interexchange carrier" means a person who
provides interexchange telecommunications service, commonly called a long distance carrier
(Sprint, MCI, and AT&T are examples), and typically deemed a carrier under the Federal
Communications Act of 1934 or amendments thereto.
The different services taken by customers shall correspond with the classes of service offered by
the permittee.
Examples of the preceding computations are as follows:
Example 1
A customer leases a 56 kbps data channel for $5,000 per month which serves or may be
accessed by one customer location each in Municipality A, Municipality B, and Municipality C.
$1,666 per month is gross revenues from Municipality A (1/3 x $5,000).
Example 2
A customer leases three T-1 telephone lines at $400 per month to connect to MCI. Gross
revenues from Municipality A are computed separately for each line as follows:
The first connects a location in Municipality B to an MCI point of presence in Municipality A.
$200 per month is the gross revenues from Municipality A for this service (1/2 x $400).
The second connects a location in Municipality A to the same MCI point of presence. AR
$400 is gross revenues from Municipality A for this service.
The third connects a location in Municipality C to a different MCI point of presence, located in
Municipality D. There are no gross revenues from Municipality A for this service, but there
would be gross revenues of $200 each in Municipality C and Municipality D.
Example 3
Sprint, an interexchange (long distance) carrier, leases a large amount of capacity from the
permittee for $50,000 per month so that persons desiring to use its services may connect with it
directly and not have to go through the local Ameritech central office. 16 customers take
advantage of this service, comprising 42 locations, of which 28 locations are in Municipality A.
Sprint's point of presence is also in Municipality A. $41,667 is gross revenues from Municipality
A as follows:
$25,000 (half of the $50,000) is included because all the circuits (wherever the customer is
located) connect to the point of presence in Municipality A; i.e., each customer circuit is
composed of two locations (one at the customer, one at Sprint), one of which is in
Municipality A.
$16,667 (28/42 of $25,000) because the other half of the $50,000 is attributable to the
specific customer locations being connected to Sprint, of which 28 out of 42 are in
Municipality A.

§ 70-181. Required.
[Code 1974, § 126-5]
No person shall use the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services without a
permit issued pursuant to this article or a consent agreement under § 70-182(3) of this article. For
purposes of this article, use of the public rights-of-way includes the installation, construction,
maintenance, repair, or operation of a telecommunications system within the public rights-of-way.
In addition, a person providing local exchange service or other local telecommunications services
is using the public rights-of-way for purposes of this article whether such person owns the facilities
in the public rights-of-way outright or obtains the use of or access to the facilities from a third party
under lease, contract, interconnection, or wholesale or retail or other similar arrangement, or acts
as a reseller of telecommunications services. Failure to comply with the permit requirement of this
section shall constitute a violation of this article. A person who violates this requirement shall
comply with all requirements of this article applicable to a permittee and shall pay the annual fee
plus late payment charges as provided by § 70-185 for the time period in which the violator did not
have a permit plus the actual costs incurred by the Township in enforcing this article against the
person.
If a telecommunications provider negotiates a consent agreement with the Township under the
provisions of § 70-182(3), and the Township determines that the consent agreement substantially
satisfies the obligations of a telecommunications provider under this article, giving due regard to
any special circumstances involving the telecommunications provider, the consent agreement will
be deemed to satisfy the requirement of a permit under this article and under the Michigan
Telecommunications Act (MCL § 484.2101 et seq.). When a consent agreement is no longer in
effect, the telecommunications provider shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions
of this article as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 70-182. Reservation of right.
[Code 1974, § 126-2]
The issuance of a permit or permits under this article and the access to and use of the public rights-ofway
by a telecommunications provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the
following reserved rights:
Right to require franchise. Article VII, § 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution requires that all
public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the Township. The applicability
of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under § 102(dd) of the
Michigan Telecommunications Act (MCL § 484.2102(dd)) which purports to define
telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services. Due to this and other legal
and regulatory issues, and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary,
the Township hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this
time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the Township.
Telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and
ongoing use of the public rights-of-way and to otherwise comply with the terms of this article. Such
a permit shall not constitute a franchise. The Township reserves the right to require
telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within
the Township. The permittee shall not provide cable service without obtaining a franchise from the
Township.
Rights regarding takings claim. Certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or
supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to
physically occupy the rights-of-way and other property of a municipality for the purpose of
providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value
of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property. Municipalities

dispute that claim. The Township believes that if such a claim were sustained it would, among
other things, constitute an unlawful taking by the United States in violation of the Fifth Amendment
of the United States Constitution. The legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally
decided. The Township desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public
rights-of-way at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues, provided this can be
done without waiver or loss of any rights of the Township or a permittee. Therefore,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, a permittee is not precluded by this article from
seeking relief from the fee provisions of § 70-185 from any court or agency of competent
jurisdiction. If a permittee seeks such relief, the Township reserves the right to assert a takings
claim and to take all action it deems necessary in support thereof. Neither this article nor the
issuance or acceptance of a permit under this article constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a
waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the Township or the permittee in
connection with these disputed issues, and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an
acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee.
Option to obtain consent agreement. The Township finds that legislative, legal, and regulatory
issues in connection with use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and the
resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development
of a healthy, competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community. This would be
detrimental to the Township and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers. The
issues affect, among other things, both the cost to telecommunications providers and
compensation to the Township for the maintenance and use of its public rights-of-way. In order to
promote certainty, encourage competition and avoid litigation, the Township will, at the request
and sole option of an applicant or permittee, consider entering into a consent agreement for use of
the public rights-of-way for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions
mutually acceptable to the Township and the telecommunications provider. It is the Township's
intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this article and
would include, among other things, a fee of up to 5% of the applicable gross revenues of the
telecommunications provider, which would include the permit fee; an extended term of up to 15
years; authorization to conduct a local business in the Township pursuant to Article VII, § 29 of the
1963 Michigan Constitution; and a covenant to abide by the terms of the agreement as a
compromise of disputed issues and uncertain outcomes, notwithstanding the resolution of these
legislative, regulatory and legal requirements in the future. A permittee may request a consent
agreement at any time.
§ 70-183. Existing maintenance permits.
[Code 1974, § 126-3]
Annual maintenance permits issued to a telecommunications provider shall not be renewed upon
expiration. Upon expiration of the annual maintenance permit, telecommunications providers shall be
required to comply with all terms and conditions of this article as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 70-184. Permit application procedures.
[Code 1974, § 126-6]
Application. A telecommunications provider shall apply for a permit pursuant to this article. The
application shall be made on an application form provided by the Township. 14 copies of the
application shall be filed with the Township Clerk and two additional copies each shall
simultaneously be filed with the Township Attorney.
Required information. In addition to other information required by the application form or otherwise
required by the Township or this article, the application shall include, without limitation, the

by the applicant or if not owned by the applicant, a copy of the agreement or legal instrument
granting the applicant the right to the use of or access to such facilities.
A map setting forth the specific location of the facilities in the public rights-of-way. The map
shall identify the location of aboveground and underground facilities. The map shall be a
detailed plan of the proposed work with the locations of all underground and overhead utilities
prepared and sealed by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer.
Additional information to include maintenance of traffic shall be included. Such plans shall be

diskette or compact disc of the drawing in AutoCAD format compatible with the Township's
geographic information system. All plans shall be submitted to the office of engineering for

Application fee. The application will be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee in an
amount established by resolution of the Township Board. The nonrefundable application fee shall
be designed to reimburse the Township for the costs of reviewing an application for a permit and
issuance of a permit in accordance with the procedures of this article.
Administrative completeness. An application shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of the
ninety-day permit application review period in § 251(3) of the Michigan Telecommunications Act
(MCL § 484.2251(3)) unless and until the application is determined by the Township Clerk to be
administratively complete. A determination whether the application is administratively complete
shall be made by the Township Clerk within 10 business days after the application is received by
the Township. If the Township Clerk determines that the application is not administratively
complete, the Township Clerk shall so advise the applicant in writing and shall identify the items
which must be furnished by the applicant for an administratively complete application.
Additional information. The Township Clerk may request an applicant to submit such additional
information that the Township Clerk deems reasonably necessary or relevant to review the
application. The applicant shall comply with all such requests in compliance with reasonable
deadlines for such additional information established by the Township Clerk. If the applicant fails to
provide the requested additional information by the deadline established by the Township Clerk,
the ninety-day period for acting on the application under subsection (g) of this section shall be
extended by the number of days after the deadline that the information was provided to the
Township Clerk.
Misleading statements. A person who provides information to the Township in connection with a
permit application or any other matters under this section that contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall be in
violation of this article and shall be subject to all remedies for violation of this article and the
Township Code including, without limitation, denial of the requested action and permit revocation
pursuant to § 70-190. Each day that a person fails to correct an untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission of a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall
constitute a separate violation of this article.
Permit approval or denial. Within 30 days after the Township Clerk determines that the application
is administratively complete, subject to any adjustments for delays in providing additional

information as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the Township Planning Commission shall
review the application and all submitted material and make a recommendation to Township Board.
Within 75 days after the Township Clerk determines that the application is administratively
complete, subject to any adjustments for delays in providing additional information as provided in
subsection (e) of this section, the Township Board shall hold a public hearing on the application.
Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper in general circulation not less than
10 days before the public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall also be mailed to the
applicant not less than 10 days before the public hearing. Any report or recommendation on the
application obtained or prepared by the Township Clerk and/or the Township Planning
Commission shall be mailed to the applicant not less than 10 days before the public hearing. The
applicant and any other interested parties may appear in person, by agent, or by letter at such
hearing to submit comments on the application.
Following the public hearing, the Township Board shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny
the application within 90 days after the Township Clerk determines that the application is
administratively complete pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, subject to any adjustments for
delays in providing additional information as provided in subsection (e) of this section. The
Township Board shall not unreasonably deny an application for a permit. The failure of the
Township to comply strictly with the procedural requirements of this section for the review of permit
applications shall not invalidate the decision or proceedings of the Township.
Conditions. The Township Board may impose conditions on a permit to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. Without limitation, these conditions may include the posting of a bond by the
telecommunications provider in an amount that shall not exceed the reasonable cost to ensure
that the public rights-of-way are returned to their original condition during and after the
telecommunications provider's access and use.
Modification. The Township Board may, in its discretion, grant a modification of a specific
requirement of § 70-186, 70-187, 70-188, or 70-217 if the applicant requests such modification in
its application for a permit and if the applicant demonstrates that there are exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances that warrant a modification, the modification will not be detrimental to
the public health, safety, and welfare, and the modification will not impair the intent and purposes
of this article and its several sections. The application shall describe the applicant's request for a
modification and the reasons for the request with specificity. A modification granted by the
Township Board pursuant to this section shall expire upon the expiration of the permit or earlier if
so determined by the Township Board. A modification shall modify only those requirements
expressly set forth in the approval of the Township Board and shall not modify any other provisions
of this article. If a request for a modification is denied by the Township Board the
telecommunications provider shall comply with all requirements of this article without exception.
Waiver. The Township Board shall grant a waiver of any requirement of this article if an applicant
or permittee requests a waiver and the Township Board finds that unless waived the requirement
will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of the applicant or permittee to provide any
telecommunications service within the meaning of § 253(a) of the Federal Telecommunications
Act, 47 USC 253(a), the requirement is not within the scope of any state or local authority
referenced in § 253(c) of the Federal Telecommunications Act, 47 USC 253(c), and the
requirement is not necessary to protect the public safety and welfare or safeguard the rights of
consumers. A request for a waiver may be included in an application for a permit. A request for a
waiver shall include a detailed statement of the facts and circumstances forming the basis for the
request. If the request is made in connection with an application for a permit, the provisions of
subsections (d)—(g) of this section shall apply to the request, except that submission of a request
for a waiver shall constitute consent that the time periods provided in subsection (g) of this section
for holding a public hearing and acting on an application are extended by 90 days. Subsections
(a),(c), and (f) of this section shall apply to a waiver request that is not made in connection with a
permit application, and the request may be denied for violation of or failure to comply with any of
those provisions. Subsection (g) of this section shall also apply to such a request, with the
exception of the seventy-five-day and ninety-day time periods set forth in that subsection, but the

Township Board may by resolution establish different or additional procedures for conducting the

§ 70-185. Annual permit fees.
[Code 1974, § 126-7]
Establishment of annual fees; payment. In addition to the nonrefundable application fee set forth in
§ 70-184(c) and any other fees for other permits or authorizations required by the Township Code,
the permittee shall pay an annual fee in an amount established by ordinance or resolution of the
Township Board. The annual fee may be modified from time to time by ordinance or resolution of
the Township Board. The amount of the annual fee shall not exceed the fixed and variable costs to
the Township in maintaining the public rights-of-way used by a telecommunications provider
unless otherwise permitted by law. The annual fee shall be payable quarterly as follows:
First quarter, January 1—March 31: April 30.
Second quarter, April 1—June 30: July 31.
Third quarter, July 1—Sept. 30: October 31.
Fourth quarter, Oct. 1—Dec. 31: January 31.
When a permit is issued during a calendar year, the annual fee shall be prorated for the
balance of the calendar year. In the event that a quarterly payment is not paid when due, the
permittee shall pay a late payment charge of the greater of $100 or interest at the rate of 1%
over the prime rate then charged by NBD Bank or its successor bank and computed
monthly. A person who violates this article by failing to obtain a permit shall pay the annual
fee plus late payment charges, as required by this section, for the time period in which the
violator did not have a permit plus the actual costs of the Township in enforcing this article
against the person.
Option to pay annual fee based upon gross revenues. If the permittee's activities in the Township
will generate gross revenues as defined in § 70-155, the permittee, at its option, may elect to pay
an annual fee of 4% of its annual gross revenues as set forth below, in lieu of and in full
satisfaction of the annual fee established by the Township Board pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section. Permittees may elect this annual fee option only if the resulting annual fee is equal to or
greater than the annual fee established by Township Board pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section. Permittees may elect this annual fee option for administrative convenience in computing
the fee or for any other reason.
An election shall be made within 45 days of applying for a permit or at least 60 days before
the start of any calendar year after issuance of a permit.
Any election, once made, shall continue in effect until the end of the next three calendar
years, such that an election made in a permit application in 1997 would continue in effect
through the end of the year 2000.
An election shall be made on a form provided by the Township. Copies of the form shall be
submitted in the manner provided in Subsection 70-184(a). The permittee shall supply all
information requested on the form and any additional information that the Township Clerk
deems reasonably necessary or relevant, including information on affiliates of the permittee
relating to the requirements of subsections 70-184(a) and subsections (b)(6),(7), and (c) of
this section. After providing notice and an opportunity to be heard the Township may reject or
revoke an election for failure to comply with this subsection (b)(3).

(e)
The annual fees shall be paid quarterly by the same due dates as are set forth in subsection
(a) of this section.
An election shall apply to all affiliates of a permittee. In making its election, a permittee shall
expressly affirm that it has the authority to bind, and does bind, its affiliates to the obligations
of subsection (b) of this section including subsection (b)(6) and the audit and records
provisions of subsections (b)(7) and (c) of this section.
For purposes of this subsection, the term "gross revenues" is defined in § 70-155.
If a permittee or any affiliate of a permittee refuses to pay the fees due under this option or
prohibits or effectively prohibits the Township from auditing the permittee or its affiliates under
subsection (c) of this section to verify the accuracy of annual fees, then the Township at its
option may revoke the election for all or any portion of the time period in question. The annual
fees computed under subsection (a) of this section shall then become immediately due and
payable, less a credit for any sums paid by the permittee or its affiliates, plus the late payment
charges set forth in subsection (a) of this section and any additional sums due under
subsection (c) of this section.
Records. All records, including those of affiliates, reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of
annual fees paid by the permittee under either subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section shall
be made available by a permittee at a location within the Township. The Township, by itself or in
combination with other municipalities, reserves the right to audit any permittee (or any affiliate of a
permittee) to verify the accuracy of annual fees paid or to be paid to the Township. Any additional
amount due the Township shall be paid within 30 days of submission of an invoice. If the additional
amount due exceeds 2% of the total annual fee which the audit determines should have been paid
for a calendar year, the permittee shall pay the Township's costs in connection with the audit within
30 days of submission of an invoice.
Other payments. The nonrefundable application fees and the annual fees established pursuant to
this article shall be in addition to any tax, charge, fee, or payment due, or to become due, to the
Township by a permittee under the Township Code or the laws of the state.
Misleading statements. A person who provides information to the Township in connection with any
matter under this section which contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material
fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall be in violation of this article and shall
be subject to all remedies for violation of this article and the Township Code including, without
limitation, rejection or revocation of an election under subsection (b) of this section and permit
revocation pursuant to § 70-190. Each day that a person fails to correct an untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission of a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading
shall constitute a separate violation of this article.
§ 70-186. Duration; renewal.
[Code 1974, § 126-8]
A permit shall remain in effect until December 31 following the tenth anniversary of the issuance of the
permit, unless the permit expires pursuant to Subsection 70-187(k) or the permit is earlier revoked
pursuant to § 70-190. Applications for renewal of permits shall be filed in the same manner as original
applications in § 70-184 and shall be filed with the Township not less than 120 days before the
expiration of the permit. The Township expressly reserves all rights to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny applications for permit renewals pursuant to this article and to impose additional
conditions on renewed permits.
§ 70-187. Terms and requirements.

[Code 1974, § 126-9]
Nonexclusive; additional permits. A permit shall be nonexclusive. The Township expressly
reserves the right to approve, at any time, additional permits for access to and ongoing use of the
public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and to enter into agreements and grant
franchises for such access and use. The issuance of additional permits, entry into agreements, or
grant of franchises shall not be deemed to amend, modify, revoke, or terminate the terms and
conditions of any permits previously issued to telecommunication providers.
Expansion requests. A permit approved by the Township Board shall authorize access to and
ongoing use of the public rights-of-way described in the permit, subject to strict compliance with
the conditions of the permit, the requirements of this article, and any other applicable requirements
of the Township Code or applicable state and federal law. The permittee shall not use any public
rights-of-way not expressly authorized by the permit. Any use of the public rights-of-way, including
any installation, construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of a telecommunication system
within the public rights-of-way, to provide telecommunications services shall be performed only as
authorized by the permit. A permittee may, however, expand its telecommunications system to
public rights-of-ways not described in its permit by obtaining approval of an amended permit from
the Township. Such approval may be granted in writing by the Township Board in response to a
written request from the permittee for expansion to specific portions of named public rights-of-way.
The Township Board may establish by resolution a nonrefundable application fee for such a
request. The Township Board may grant, grant with conditions, or deny such request. The
Township Board shall not unreasonably deny any request. A denial of any request may be
appealed to the Township Board which shall make the final decision. Any expansion into additional
public rights-of-way shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the original permit and this
article including, without limitation, the application of the annual fee to the expanded public rightsof-
way used by the permittee.
Construction permit. A permittee shall not commence construction upon, over, across, or under
the public rights-of-way in the Township without first obtaining a construction permit as required
under the Township Code for construction within the public rights-of-way.
Lease or use of facilities; overlashing. A permittee shall not lease, sublease, license, or otherwise
allow the use of wires, conduit, poles, or facilities in the public rights-of-way by a person who is
required to obtain a permit under § 70-181 or is required by law to obtain the Township's
permission or consent to transact local business in the Township and who lacks such permit,
permission, or consent. A permittee shall not allow the property of a third party or
nontelecommunications system wires or any other facilities to be overlashed, affixed, or attached
to any portion of a permittee's telecommunications system or allow other actions with a similar
result without the written consent of the Township Clerk.
As built maps. Without expense to the Township, a permittee shall provide the Township with asbuilt
maps, records, and plans showing its telecommunications system or portions thereof within
the Township, including those of affiliates used by the permittee, and maps and descriptive
information of facilities of other persons used by the permittee. The Township Clerk may waive
part or all of this requirement if satisfactory records of the location of the telecommunications
system were previously provided to the Township. The as-built maps, records, and plans shall be
provided within 60 days of the completion of the telecommunications system and any extensions,
additions, or modifications to the telecommunications system. In addition to the foregoing, a
permittee, without expense to the Township, shall upon 48 hours' notice give the Township access
to all as-built maps, records, plans, and specifications showing its telecommunications system or
portions thereof within the Township. Upon request by the Township, a permittee shall inform the
Township as soon as possible, but no more than one business day after the request, of any
changes from previously supplied maps, records, or plans and shall mark up maps provided by
the Township so as to show the location of its telecommunications system. As built plans shall be
submitted on mylar (minimum three mils thick) accompanied by a computer diskette or compact
disc of the drawings in AutoCAD format compatible with the Township's geographic information
system. All plans shall be submitted to the office of engineering for review.

No recourse. A permittee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the Township for any loss,
cost, expense, or damage arising out of the failure of the Township to have the authority to grant
all or any part of a permit or the authority to grant permission to use all or part of the public rightsof-
way. A permittee expressly acknowledges that on accepting a permit it did so relying on its own
investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the Township.
No inducement. By acceptance of a permit, a permittee acknowledges that it has not been

of a permit not expressed in this article.
Acceptance of terms and conditions. Permittee acknowledges by the acceptance of a permit that it
has carefully read its terms and conditions and does accept all of such terms and conditions.
No priority. A permit does not establish any priority of use of the public rights-of-way by a
permittee over any present or future permittees or parties having agreements with the Township or
franchises for such use. In the event of any dispute as to the priority of use of the public rights-ofway,
the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority to the Township, the third
priority to the state and its political subdivisions in the performance of their various functions, and
thereafter as between permittees, other permit holders, parties having agreements with the

Future use by Township. A permittee acknowledges, by accepting a permit, that it obtains no rights
to or further use of the public rights-of-way other than those expressly granted in this article. Each
permittee acknowledges and accepts as its own risk that the Township may make use in the future
of the public rights-of-way which a permittee is using or in which a permittee's telecommunications
system is located in a manner inconsistent with the permittee's use of such public rights-of-way
and that in such event the permittee will not be entitled to compensation from the Township.
Expiration of permit. Unless the Township grants an extension, a permit shall expire one year from
the date of issuance unless prior thereto the permittee either commences construction,
installation, or operation of its telecommunications system within the public rights-of-way
authorized by the permit and diligently pursues completion of construction or installation or
commences use of the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services as authorized
by the permit.

telecommunications system from any Township buildings, police stations, fire stations, other public
buildings, traffic signals, each school licensed by the state, and each public library within 500 feet
of the telecommunications system for the purpose of obtaining services on terms and conditions
set forth in the permit.

No burden on public rights-of-way. A permittee and its contractors and subcontractors and a
permittee's telecommunications system shall not unduly burden or interfere with the present or
future use of any of the public rights-of-way within the Township. A permittee shall erect and
maintain its telecommunications system so as to cause minimum interference with the use of the
public rights-of-way and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners.
Permittee's cables and wires shall be suspended or buried so as to not endanger or injure persons
or property in the public rights-of-way. If the Township in its reasonable judgment determines that

other actions as the Township may determine are in the public interest to remove or alleviate the
burden, and the permittee shall do so within the time period established by the Township.
Restoration of property. A permittee and its contractors and subcontractors shall immediately
restore, at the permittee's sole cost and expense and in a manner approved by the Township, any
portion of the public rights-of-way that is in any way disturbed, damaged, or injured by the
construction, operation, maintenance, or removal of the telecommunications system to as good or
better condition than that which existed prior to the disturbance. In the event that the permittee, its
contractors, or subcontractors fail to do so within the time specified by the Township, the Township
shall be entitled to complete the work and the permittee shall reimburse the Township for the costs
of doing so.
Easements. Any easements over or under private property necessary for the construction or
operation of a telecommunications system shall be arranged and paid for by the permittee. Any

article. Any easements over or under property owned by the Township other than the public rightsof-
way shall be separately negotiated with the Township.
Tree trimming. A permittee may trim trees upon and overhanging the public rights-of-way so as to
prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with its telecommunications system.

the public rights-of-way with the county's program for street construction, rebuilding, resurfacing,
and repair (collectively, street resurfacing). A permittee shall meet with the official of the Township
primarily responsible for the public rights-of-way at least twice per year to this end. The goals of
such coordination shall be to require a permittee to conduct all work in the public rights-of-way in
conjunction with or immediately prior to any street resurfacing planned by the Township or county
and to prevent the public rights-of-way from being disturbed by a permittee for a period of years
after such street resurfacing. In addition to any other fees or payments required by this article, a
permittee shall pay to the county the sum established by the county's schedule of permit fees for
each such cut or excavation. This fee is in addition to and not in lieu of the obligation to restore the
public rights-of-way and is in addition to all other fees required by this article or the Township
Code.
Marking. A permittee shall mark any installations of its telecommunications system which occur
after the effective date of this article as follows:
Aerial portions of its telecommunications system shall be marked with a marker on its lines on
alternate poles which shall state the permittee's name and provide a toll-free number to call
for assistance.
Direct buried underground portions of its telecommunications system shall have a conducting
wire placed in the ground at least several inches above the permittee's cable, if such cable is
nonconductive, at least several inches above that a continuous-colored tape with the
permittee's name and a toll-free phone number and a statement to the effect that there is
buried cable beneath, and stakes or other appropriate aboveground markers with the
permittee's name and a toll-free number indicating that there is buried telephone cable below.
Portions of its telecommunications system located in conduit, including facilities of others
used by a permittee, shall be marked at each manhole with the permittee's name and toll-free
telephone number to call for assistance.

[Code 1974, § 111-4.5; Ord. No. 2001-19, 12-4-2001]
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one
building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be
constructed to the rear building through an adjoining court, yard, or driveway, the building sewer from
the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer. The Township Manager may waive the requirement of a separate and independent building
sewer for every building if all of the following criteria are met:
The building for which the waiver is requested is on the same lot as the building from which the
sewer will be extended and both buildings are owned by the same person or entities;
The Director of Community Planning and Development determines that the lot on which the
buildings are located may not be split under current state, local, or federal laws or Township rules
or ordinances; and
The Director of Public Works and Engineering ascertains there will be a reduced risk of infiltration
into the sanitary sewer system and there is no public health, safety, or welfare reason to require
separate and independent sewer for every building.
If at any time a waiver is granted, the lot is split, or the buildings are owned by different persons

sewer service extension may be authorized at the expense of the applicant. Temporary service may be
authorized due to an emergency because of a septic system failure or if the Township Board
determines that a main line extension will unlikely be required or appropriate beyond the affected
property in the immediate future. In no event shall a temporary service extend beyond two parcels or
200 feet, whichever is less, from the existing public sewer to the customer's property line. The
applicant for a temporary connection shall pay a benefit charge in the amount established by resolution
in cash unless installment payments are approved by the Township Board and shall pay the
appropriate connection fee in cash prior to connection to the temporary service. When the main is
eventually extended, the benefit charge collected for the temporary connection will be applied to the
benefit charge computed for the extension of the sewer main. At the time the main is extended, the
temporary service shall be abandoned.

Any wastewater having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 10.0 or having any other corrosive
property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of
the POTW, unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater.
Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singularly or by
interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process,
to constitute a hazard to humans or animals, to create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of
the POTW, or to exceed the limitations set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. The
toxic pollutants shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to § 307(a)
of the Act.
Any noxious of malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which, either singularly or by interaction
with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to
prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
Any substance which may cause the POTW effluent or other product of the POTW such as
residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or interferes with the
reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW
to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations
developed under § 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use
or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act; or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being

§ 78-280. Compliance deadline, existing source, new sources.
[Code 1974, § 111B-2.0(2.5)]
Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of
the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate
subpart of 40 CFR Ch. I, Subch. N. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to
promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial
users except where such sources meet the definition of a new source as defined in § 78-241. New
sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall startup all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time, not to exceed 90 days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
§ 78-281. Modification of federal categorical pretreatment
standards.
[Code 1974, § 111B-2.0(2.6)]
Where the Township's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited
by federal pretreatment standards, the Township may apply to approval authority for modification of
specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the reduction in
the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment
system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95% of the
samples taken measured according to the procedures set forth in § 403.7(c)(2) of title 40 of the Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of
Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The Township may then modify pollutant discharge limits
and the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and
prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. Any user requesting application for modification
shall reimburse the Township for all costs of testing and data compilation required by 40 CFR 403.7.
§ 78-282. Alternate calculation of limits.
[Code 1974, § 111B-2.0(2.7)]
When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant
per unit of production, the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent
limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
When calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations under this section, the director shall
calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user's average
rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed
production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual longterm
daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. For new
sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.
When calculating equivalent concentration limitations under this section, the director shall
calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitation derived under this section by the average
daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate
shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual longterm average flow
rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year.
Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section shall be deemed pretreatment
standards for the purposes of § 307(d) of the Act and this Code. Industrial users will be required to
comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which
the equivalent limitations were derived.
2/13/2020 Charter Township of Meridian Ecode360

(5)
(a)
(b)
(c)
If categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge
limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average
limitations, where applied, the same production of flow figures shall be used in calculating both
types of equivalent limitations.
Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production based standard shall notify the director within two
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the director of such
anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its control
mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the longterm average production rate.
§ 78-283. Dilution prohibited.
[Code 1974, § 111B-2.0(2.9)]
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no
industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on industrial users
which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
§ 78-284. Accidental discharges.
[Code 1974, § 111B-2.0(2.10)]
Protective facilities and plans. All categorical and noncategorical industrial/commercial users with
the potential to discharge toxic substances or prohibited pollutants in amounts which may interfere
with the operation of the POTW shall provide necessary protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge or prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense
upon request of the Township. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the Township for review when required and shall be
approved by the Township before construction of the facility. All existing users who are required to
provide such a plan shall complete such a plan by May 1, 1985. No user who commences
contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this division shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the
Township. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this division. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of all
categorical and noncategorical users to immediately (within 24 hours) telephone and notify the
POTW of the incident. The location shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the
director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be opposed by this article or other applicable
law.
Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge.

Net/gross calculation of limits. The director may adjust the categorical pretreatment standards to
reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this
subsection.
Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the
director. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a
net basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of
subsections (f)(2) and (3) of this subsection are met.
The industrial user must demonstrate that the control system it proposes or uses to meet
applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet
the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended
solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user
demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are
substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless
appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or
elsewhere.

Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
owner, new source, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the
Township. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of all
existing permits.
§ 78-312. Reporting requirements.
[Code 1974, § 111B-4.0(4.3)]
Generally. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any categorical user subject to pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the director a report showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow in gallons per day from regulated process streams and such other streams as
necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) and identifying
the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. In addition, the report shall
include the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass
where required) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily
maximum and average concentration (or mass) shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations and shall be taken in the frequency and manner provided by 40
CFR 403(12)(b)(5). The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirement are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements.
Periodic compliance reports:
Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard or, in the case of a new user, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW,
shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently by the Township, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or
regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standard. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual
measurement; however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Township may
accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by variable techniques. At the
discretion of the director in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director for good cause shown, may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
If the director has imposed mass limitations on users, the report required by subsection (b)(1)
of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standard in the
effluent of the user. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, the
report required by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user's longterm production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production or other measure of operation, the report shall include the user's actual average
production rate for the reporting period.
Reports of users shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including
the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
director of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment
standard. The report shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be
prescribed by the director to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable

question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth by the EPA, or in accordance with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the administrator.
If sampling performed by an industrial user indicated a violation, the user shall notify the
director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation.
Reporting requirements, noncategorical discharges. Industrial users with discharges which are not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit such reports as the director deems
necessary to verify compliance with all of the general discharge limitations and prohibitions of this
Code.
Base line monitoring report. At least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharge, new
sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgations of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the director a report which contains
estimates of the measured average daily and maximum daily flow of process streams and waste
streams and flow and amount of regulated pollutants in the form and containing the information
required by 40 CFR, 403.12(b)(1)—(5) and shall include in this report information on the method of
pretreatment intended to be used to meet the applicable pretreatment standards.
Signatory requirements. All reports required by this section shall contain the certification statement
as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and shall be signed as follows:
By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user submitting the reports required by
subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section is a corporation. For the purpose of this subsection

§ 78-313. Monitoring facilities.
[Code 1974, § 111B-4.0(4.4)]
When required by the Township, a user shall provide and operate at the user's own expense
monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge
to the Township. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but
the Township may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, monitoring facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the Township's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
§ 78-314. Inspection and sampling.
[Code 1974, § 111B-4.0(4.5)]
The Township may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is
being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Township or their representative ready access at
all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The Township, MDEQ and EPA shall have the
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force
which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Township, MDEQ and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay,
for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
§ 78-315. Pretreatment.
[Code 1974, § 111B-4.0(4.6)]
Users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with this division
and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time
limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the Township shall be provided, operated, and maintained at
the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the Township for review and shall be acceptable to the Township before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the Township under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the

The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user during the
same 12 months.
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials
of the EPA or approval authority upon request.
§ 78-316. Bypass of pretreatment facilities.
[Code 1974, § 111B-4.0(4.7)]
Definitions. The following defined terms shall be applied to this section:
BYPASS
The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment
facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE
Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does
not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may
allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be
violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
Notice:
If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to
the Township, if possible at least 10 days before the date of the bypass.
An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards to the Township within 24 hours from the time the industrial user
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of
the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact
dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within 24 hours.
Prohibition of bypass:
Bypass is prohibited, and the Township may take enforcement action against an industrial
user for a bypass, unless:
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage;
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of
equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment

The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section.
The director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the
director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this
section.
§ 78-317. Confidential information.
[Code 1974, § 111B-4.0(4.8)]
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits,
monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Township that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall
be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this division,
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system
permit, and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall
be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information.

Subdivision IV. Enforcement
§ 78-341. Harmful contributions.
[Code 1974, § 111B-5.0(5.1)]
The Township may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Township, in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or the environment, causes interference to the
POTW, or causes the Township to violate any condition of the NPDES permit.
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater
contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Township shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The Township shall
reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof
of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the
user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence shall be submitted to the Township within 15 days of the date of occurrence.

A rezoning traffic study prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, based in whole or in part, on
the most current edition of the handbook titled Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies: A
Recommended Practice for Michigan Communities, published by the state department of

Rezonings when the proposed district would permit uses that could generate more than
100 additional directional trips during the peak hour than the principal uses permitted
under the current zoning.
Rezonings of land having direct access to a principal or minor arterial street, unless the
uses in the proposed zoning district would generate fewer peak hour trips than uses in
the existing zoning district.
A threshold table converting peak hour directional trips to specific land uses shall be

conditions apply to the land. Except for an extension, if the conditions are not satisfied within
the time specified, the land shall revert to its former zoning classification.
The local government shall not add to or alter the conditions during the specified time period.
The specified time period may be extended upon the application of the landowner and
approval of the Township.

[Code 1974, § 81-3.2(A)]
The Township finds that certain uses are generally compatible in designated zoning districts, but their
nature, design, or location may have negative effects on adjacent land uses as well as the health,

Only the uses authorized as special uses in Article IV of this chapter or as otherwise authorized in
Article VI of this chapter may be issued a special use permit. Uses not expressly authorized are
prohibited. The designation of a use as a special use does not constitute an assurance that a special
use permit will be issued by the Planning Commission. Special uses, because of their nature, require
special restrictions and some measure of attention in order to determine whether or not such uses will
be compatible with uses permitted by right in the zoning district and with this chapter. Special uses are,
therefore, prohibited uses unless permitted by the Township as provided in this chapter. Each request
for a special use permit shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission for compliance with the criteria
set forth in this division and the applicable standards specified for such special use in the zoning
district where the use is to be located.
§ 86-123. Preliminary discussions.
[Code 1974, § 81-3.2(C)]
The applicant may meet with the Director of Community Planning and Development to discuss the
requirements for a special use permit. In addition to the preliminary discussions, the applicant may
submit a conceptual plan for review by the Director of Community Planning and Development in order
that preliminary technical deficiencies may be addressed prior to submittal of an application for a
special use permit. This procedure is intended to be informational only and shall not limit the substance
of the review process.
§ 86-124. Application requirements.
[Code 1974, § 81-3.2(D)]
The application shall be submitted to the Director of Community Planning and Development to be
submitted to the Planning Commission and shall include the provisions specified in this section.
Only complete applications shall be processed.
A completed special use permit application form, available in the Department of Community
Planning and Development, shall contain the following information, if applicable:
The type of special use requested.
The address and/or parcel number of the property.
The applicant's name, address, and phone number.
The name, address, and phone number of all persons with an ownership interest, if different

§ 86-219. Environmental commission review.
[Code 1974, § 81-3.5(D)]
When in the determination of the Director of Community Planning and Development a requested
variance affects either a regulated wetland, wetland setback, or both, the director may refer the case to
the environmental commission.
§ 86-220. Review process.
[Code 1974, § 81-3.5(E); Ord. No. 2007-12, 10-28-2007]
Upon determination that the application for a variance, site specific interpretation, or site specific
appeal of a decision by the Director of Community Planning and Development is complete, the Director
of Community Planning and Development shall initiate the review process as described below:
Notice of public hearing. Notices shall comply with the provisions outlined in Subsection 86-65(b)
of the Code of Ordinances.
Conduct of public hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing in
accordance with the organization and procedures set forth in § 86-62(d).
Decision. Decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals to approve or deny an application for a
variance are final, subject to appeal to the proper court of jurisdiction.
Notice of decision. The Director of Community Planning and Development shall notify the
applicant in writing of the zoning board of appeal's decision.
§ 86-221. Review criteria.
[Code 1974, § 81-3.5(F); Ord. No. 2007-12, 10-28-2007]
In the review of an application for a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals should determine if the
following criteria are satisfied:
Unique circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure, that are not applicable to
other land or structures in the same zoning district.
These special circumstances are not self-created.
Strict interpretation and enforcement of the literal terms and provisions of this chapter would result
in practical difficulties.
That the alleged practical difficulties which will result from a failure to grant the variance would
unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose.
Granting the variance is the minimum action that will make possible the use of the land or
structure in a manner which is not contrary to the public interest and which would carry out the
spirit of this zoning ordinance, secure public safety, and provide substantial justice.
Granting the variance will not adversely affect adjacent land or the essential character in the
vicinity of the property.
The conditions pertaining to the land or structure are not so general or recurrent in nature as to
make the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions practicable.
Granting the variance will be generally consistent with public interest and the purposes and intent
of this chapter.

Purpose.
A one-family residential district implies a predominant occurrence of dwelling structures
located on individual lots of land and housing only one family or household group. There
exists, however, a range of preference relative to the character and size of individual
residential properties that prompts creation of at least three one-family residential districts.
Furthermore, in consideration of the excessive cost of extending water and sewerage service
to all areas of the Township, the establishment of a zoning district in which spacious lots are
required makes it reasonably possible to obtain a continuous supply of safe, potable water on

the immediate property and to treat sewage by septic tank followed by the disposal of the
effluent on the same property.
This section, therefore, establishes the RR one-family rural residential district, together with
the regulations for all permitted land uses. It is the purpose of this section to establish a
district composed of residential properties of a semirural character and one that includes
facilities for an extended period of time into the future. This district includes existing lowdensity
one-family properties as well as areas within which such development appears both
likely and desirable, and the availability of water and sewers by itself shall not constitute
cause for instituting a higher density zoning.
The requirements for this district are designed to protect and stabilize the essential
characteristics of these areas and to promote and encourage a suitable and safe environment
for family life. Residential development involving higher population densities and requiring
higher levels of public, facilities, and services shall be excluded from this district, but can be
accommodated in either the RAA, RA or RB single-family residential districts, the RX oneand
two-family residential districts or the RD, RDD, RN, RC or RCC multiple-family residential
districts.
In order to avoid intrusion of undesirable uses and to foster all possible benefits for continued
high quality of residential environment, all nonresidential land and structure uses in this
district have been classified into those uses permitted by right and those permitted by special
use permit. Those uses permitted by right include those that require a minimum of limitations,
but those uses presenting potential injurious effect upon residential and other property, unless
authorized under specific imposed conditions, are controlled through the issuance of special
use permits.

§ 86-376. Multiple-Family Residential Districts: RDD, RD, RC,
RCC Districts.
[Code 1974, § 82-7; Ord. No. 2002-05, 5-7-2002; Ord. No. 2007-14, 11-25-2007; Ord. No. 2010-02, 2-
28-2010; Ord. No. 2010-11, 8-22-2010]
Purpose. The RDD, RD, RC, and RCC districts are intended to accommodate multiple-family
residential uses at a higher density than any single-family district, but at no lower standards of
quality. The primary purposes of these districts are to accommodate multiple-family developments
of sustained desirability and stability that will be harmonious to adjacent properties, to promote
large parcel, single-owner developments that allow an added degree of flexibility in the placement,
bulk, and interrelationship of the buildings and uses within a planned project and adjacent areas,
and to maintain the overall intensity of land use, density of population, and required open space
specified in this section and in the comprehensive development plan of the Township.
The primary distinction between these districts is density. The RDD zone permits a maximum
of five dwelling units per acre, the RD zone permits a maximum of eight dwelling units per
acre, the RC zone permits a maximum of 14 dwelling units per acre, and the RCC zone
permits variable high density up to a maximum of 34 dwelling units per acre. In addition,
single-family detached living units are permitted in the RDD zoning district, but not in the RD,
RC, and RCC zoning districts.
Uses permitted by right.
All uses permitted by right in the RB district, subject to the restrictions and dimensional
requirements specified therefor, except that one-family dwellings shall not be permitted in the
RD, RC, and RCC zoning districts.
Two-family dwellings in the RDD, RD, and RC districts; provided that no more than two
unrelated persons may occupy a living unit in these districts.
Uses permitted by special use permit from the Planning Commission or planning director.

§ 86-377. RN District: Village of Nemoka Mixed Residential
District.
[Code 1974, § 82-16]
Purpose.
The purpose of the RN district is to permit a mixture of single-family and multiple-family
residential dwellings within the area commonly known as the Village of Nemoka area of
Haslett. The Village of Nemoka is characterized by a mixture of multiple-family and singlefamily
dwellings unlike other areas of the Township where differing land uses have been
segregated through the use of zoning. It is not the intent of this section to discourage either of
the prominent land uses in the Village of Nemoka but to promote the unique character of the
mixed land uses currently found in the Village. In the RN district both single-family dwelling
units and multiple-family dwelling units at a maximum density of 14 units per acre, are
permitted.

§ 86-378. PRD District: Planned Residential Development
Overlay District.
[Code 1974, § 86-11]
Purpose.
The purpose of the PRD district is to preserve natural features and open space by allowing
flexibility and alternative design standards for single-family residential developments. While lot
dimensions and yard requirements may be reduced from that required in the underlying
zoning district, the overall number of dwelling units in the development shall not exceed the
number of dwelling units that could have been developed under conventional subdivision
development.
This district is intended to promote single-family development that minimizes development
impacts on important natural features and the more economic provision of infrastructure.
Minimum requirements and performance standards are set forth to ensure the objectives of
this district are achieved.

Method of determining number of dwelling units for the development parcel. The maximum
number of dwelling units that may be permitted on any development parcel shall be derived in
the following manner:
The applicant shall prepare a preliminary lot layout, containing information required by
the Department of Community Planning and Development, in conformance with the
underlying zoning district in which the development parcel is located or the district being
requested with a concurrent rezoning application, and in conformance with the
comprehensive development plan, the subdivision regulations, and the Township's Code
of Ordinances, without variances. The preliminary lot layout may show roads crossing
regulated wetlands at the narrowest points. The purpose for this requirement is to
determine the number of lots that could be located on the development parcel using
conventional development standards within the underlying zoning district or the
requested zoning district. The Department of Community Planning and Development
shall determine the maximum number of dwelling units within 15 days of submittal of a
preliminary lot layout meeting the submittal requirements of the department. A fee set
forth in the adopted schedule of fees shall accompany the submittal.
For purposes of determining the maximum number of dwelling units, the Department of
Community Planning and Development shall assume public sanitary sewer in reviewing
the preliminary lot layout, if the applicant intends to request sanitary sewer service as
part of the PRD application. This does not obligate the Township to provide sanitary
sewer service to the property and the number of lots shown in the preliminary lot layout
shall be adjusted as necessary if on-site septic systems are to be utilized.
Once the preliminary lot layout is found by the Department of Community Planning and
Development to be in conformance with the governing regulations, the total number of
lots intended for residential units shall become the maximum number of dwelling units
permitted on the development parcel under the PRD overlay zoning district.
Open space preservation:
A minimum of 20% of the development parcel shall remain as open space.
The following areas shall not be counted toward the minimum open space requirements:
[Amended 2-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-02]
Residential lots.
Public or private rights-of-way.
Driveways and parking areas.
Buffer areas required by this section, unless contiguous and integrated with other
preserved open space.
Floodways, floodplains, wetlands, or other water bodies or waterways, unless they
are part of a golf course.
Public or private easements.
The required amount of open space shall be preserved in perpetuity. The preserved open
space shall be deeded to the development's homeowners' association, a land
conservancy, the public or otherwise protected in a manner acceptable to the Township.
The form of all preservation instruments shall be approved by the Township Attorney. The
preserved open space shall be shown and appropriately labeled on the plat approved by
the Township and recorded with the county register of deeds.

Except as otherwise provided, a maximum of 50% of preserved open space may be used
for the provision of active recreational amenities for the development's residents or public
use, if designed to limit adverse impacts on important natural features preserved in
conformance with the purposes of this district. As used in this section, a golf course is
considered a recreational amenity and does not include any structures, appurtenances,
driveways or parking areas. If the recreational facility plan includes a golf course, a
maximum of 75% of preserved open space may be used for the provision of active
recreational amenities for the development's residents or public use, if designed to limit
adverse impacts on important natural features preserved in conformance with the
purposes of this district. Any recreational facility plan shall be approved as part of the
PRD application.
[Amended 2-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-02]
Design standards. The following standards are intended to ensure that the development is
designed to preserve important natural features and open space.

Purposes and intent. The C-1 commercial district is intended to provide convenient day-to-day
retail and personal services to persons living in adjacent residential areas with a minimum impact
upon surrounding residential development. Uses within the district shall be limited to those
necessary to satisfy basic shopping or service needs which, by their nature and size, are not
related to community or regional level shopping patterns. It is further intended that this district
encourage the concentration of local business areas in locations that promote the best use of
land, avoiding strip business frontage development and allowing easy access by all persons
regardless of vehicular availability. This section applies to the C-1 district.
Standards applying to all C-1 uses:
Minimum lot area: 4,000 square feet.
Minimum lot width: 50 feet.
Side and rear setback adjacent to a residential district. No building, parking, access drives, or
other structures shall be less than 50 feet from a residential district, except a thirty-five-foot
setback shall be required if a screen comprised of a double row of interlocking trees or the
equivalent is provided in addition to normal landscape requirements.
Off-street parking and loading:
No parking shall be permitted in the required front setback.

abut residential properties shall be finished with materials that in color and texture resemble
the front of the building or blend with the landscaping.
Pedestrian and bicycle pathways. Where feasible, pathways for pedestrians and bicycles
shall connect projects in the C-1 district to adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Location in freestanding buildings. Uses may be located in separate freestanding buildings,
provided the style and building materials used create a uniform architectural theme.
Business hours. Business hours shall be limited to 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight seven days a
week, except emergency medical clinics may be open 24 hours. All other uses may operate

Purpose. It is the purpose of the CV conservancy district to protect the natural, human, and
economic resources of the Township and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
by application of special regulations for the use of land which may be subject to periodic
inundation at predictable intervals, or which may be particularly suited to provide for the
impoundment of waters for the purpose of stormwater control or groundwater recharge. Such
regulations, while permitting reasonable economic use and considering the physical limitations of
such land, will help to protect the public health, public safety, and general welfare and will reduce
the financial burdens imposed upon the community which may result from the improper use of
land. All lands included in such district shall be subject to the terms imposed in this section in
addition to the terms imposed by any other district in which such lands may be located.
Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases when used in this section, shall have the

Purpose. The intent of this district is to permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative
design of residential areas than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is the
intention of this section to allow flexibility without sacrificing established values and rights to
adequate light, air, noise, and privacy. It is further intended to promote open space and more cost
efficient housing, circulation systems, utilities, and use of land. A premise basic to this section is to
consider only developments that will result in lasting value and make a contribution to both social
and economic stability in the Township. Finally, because flexibility is inherent in the concept of a
PUD, a higher degree of public direction and scrutiny is an essential part of this section. These
provisions are set forth in the following subsections of this section. In addition, prospective PUD
developers should be aware that final decision of approval or denial of a planned unit
development, even though the planned unit development appears to meet the written and outlined
criteria as listed in this section, remains with the Township Planning Commission and, in turn, the
Township Board at the time and manner as in described in this section.
Minimum PUD performance objectives.
All applications shall provide for buffering between any conflicting feature of the design and
adjacent residential land use.
All applications shall ensure good internal and external pedestrian accessibility with a
minimum of conflicting points with the vehicular circulation system. Special provisions for
safety such as pedestrian overpasses may be required.
All applications shall minimize the cost of street construction and associated maintenance
costs while adhering to official Township construction standards.
All applications shall consider convenient access to public transportation.
All applications shall minimize the cost of utility construction and associated maintenance
costs while adhering to construction standards.

All applications shall take advantage of natural vegetation and topographic characteristics to
promote natural air conditioning and enhancement of air quality. This same consideration, in
conjunction with the direction and angle of the sun, shall be considered to assist with
minimizing energy consumption.
All applications should enhance and preserve wildlife habitat, with special attention to
wetlands and other unique habitats. The creation of ponds and habitats that enhance wildlife
possibilities is encouraged so long as it is not detrimental to existing quality wetlands and
wildlife habitats. Wildlife habitat does not refer to croplands, grassy fields, or other areas of
usual abundance, but to special land features such as orchards, small woodlots, swales,
ponds, and areas where cover type is abundant enough so as to stand out from the rest of the
landscape and where it is common to find wild birds and animals.
Except in unusual circumstances, stormwater runoff induced by the proposed development
shall be detained for storage and infiltration on the site.
All applications shall provide for active and/or passive recreation on the site in harmony with
the character of the open space.
A minimum of 50% of the project area allowed for density determination, excluding wetlands
and floodplains, shall be provided as open space. Deliberate efforts must be made to
preserve important landscape features and amenities of longterm value and use these
features as key components of design. Open space shall consist of large blocks of land,
wherever possible.
All applications shall contain a housing type or types sufficient in number to maintain a
harmonious relationship with important site features, structures and adjacent land uses and
represent quality in design. Setback requirements for multiple dwellings should conform to
setback regulations, set forth in Subsection 86-376(g), except where variations can be
justified and are approved by the Planning Commission and Board of Trustees.
All applications shall demonstrate that there is adequate capacity of public streets, sewer and
water facilities to serve the development. All applications shall demonstrate the suitability of
ground water for on-site water supply in areas not served by public water and the suitability
for on-site sewage disposal in areas not served by public sewers. If existing facilities are
found by the Planning Commission to be inadequate, the applicant shall correct the
deficiencies prior to final PUD approval.
General restrictions and standards.
Minimum project area. Subject to the conditions set forth in this section and elsewhere in this
chapter, planned unit developments are permitted on sites of any size. No commercial uses of
any nature shall be permitted in any planned unit development of less than 15 contiguous
acres or in any planned unit development located in the RRR single-family rural residential
low density or RR rural residential districts. For planned unit development consisting of 15
contiguous acres or more and located in any district except RRR and RR, the commercial
uses shall be allowed as provided for by the chapter but in no event shall such use occupy
more than 3% of the total buildable land area of the planned unit development. Prior to
issuance of a building permit for construction of any approved commercial use, occupancy
permits shall have been issued for a minimum of 75% of the planned unit development's
residential component. Land used for commercial purposes in a planned unit development
shall not be used to determine allowable residential densities.
Location. Planned unit developments of allowable size may be located in any residential
district upon approval of the Planning Commission.
Uses permitted. Subject to the provisions of this chapter all uses permitted in all residential
districts and C-1 district shall be permitted in planned unit developments, except as limited in

subsection (c)(1) above.
Requirements.
Yard, setback, lot size, type of dwelling unit, height, frontage requirements, and use
restrictions are generally waived for the planned unit development, except as noted,
provided that the spirit and intent of this section, as defined in the purpose clause above,
are incorporated with the total development plan. The Planning Commission may
determine that certain setbacks be established within all or a portion of the site and shall
determine the suitability of the total development plan in accordance with the purpose
and performance section.
Every structure or dwelling unit shall have access to a public street, walkway, or other
area dedicated to common use.
Privacy. Each development shall provide visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units.
Features such as fences, screening walls, insulation, walks, barriers, and landscaping shall
be used, as appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the
privacy of its occupants. High-rise buildings shall be located within a planned unit
development in such a way as to minimize any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings
either within the development or adjacent area and to avoid an invasion of the privacy of the
occupants of such low-rise buildings.
Off-street parking. Parking space shall be provided in accordance with the following
standards:
Minimum parking space size shall be 200 square feet.
A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided for each dwelling unit, except as
noted in subsection c.
Uses other than one- and two-family residential, such as housing for the elderly,
commercial uses, institutional uses, or similar uses, shall meet the motor vehicle parking
and loading, and bicycle parking requirements set forth in Article VIII of this chapter.
Common driveways, parking areas, walks, and steps may be required, together with
appropriate lighting, in order to ensure the safety of the occupants and the general public.
Screening of parking and service areas may be required through use of trees, shrubs,
hedges, or screening walls.
Density. The total number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined in accordance with
the following stipulations:
Preparation of a site plan based on a preliminary lot layout (yield plan) developed in
conformance with the underlying zoning district, the subdivision regulations (as
applicable), and the Township Code of Ordinances to determine the number of residential
dwelling units the site will yield, the site plan and preliminary lot layout shall be submitted
with the PUD application and other materials required in subsection (e)(3)a.2.
Those sites which contain wetlands and/or floodplains shall be permitted a maximum
number of units based on the following formula:
N = D x C
Where:
N = Maximum number units permitted
D = Allowable density from the yield plan [Subsection (c)(7)a]

C = 1.0+ percent of the site in floodplain and wetland expressed as decimal.
For purposes of this chapter wetland areas are those lands which meet the definition of
a wetland set forth in the Meridian Township Code of Ordinances § 22-116. For
purposes of this section floodplain areas are those lands which meet the definition for
"intermediate regional floodplain" contained in § 86-436 of the zoning ordinance.
In the RRA, RAAA, RAA, RA, and RB districts, the maximum density as computed by
subsection (c)(7) may be increased no more than 25% of the net allowable density of the
buildable land when a planned unit development is designed with unique and
extraordinary amenities, such as preservation of woodlots, provisions of lakes, provision
of recreational facilities, provision of affordable housing, etc.
When more than one zoning district is involved in a PUD application, the density of the
project will be based on the average of the zoning districts involved, weighted in direct
proportion to the size of the property within the project in each zone.
In certain instances the density permitted in a PUD based on subsections (c)(7)a—d of
this section may exceed the maximum density shown on the comprehensive
development plan map for the development site. In these instances, the density
computed by subsection (c)(7)a and b of this section supercedes the comprehensive
development plan map as well as other requirements set forth in this title for compliance
with the comprehensive development plan.
Open spaces. "Common open space" is defined as a parcel or parcels of land or an area of
water or a combination of land and water designed and intended for the use or enjoyment of
the residents of the PUD or of the general public. Preservation of attractive site features and
diversity of features is encouraged. Common open space does not include proposed streets,
rights-of-way, open parking areas, and commercial areas. Common open space may include
a recreational trail, picnic area, children's play area, greenway, linear park, or golf course. As
used in this section, a golf course does not include any structures, appurtenances, or parking
areas.
[Amended 2-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-02]
Conveyance and maintenance of common open space. All common open space shown
on the final development plan and recorded in the office of the county register of deeds
must be reserved or dedicated by lease or conveyance of title, including beneficial
ownership, to a corporation, association, or other legal entity or by reservation by means
of a restrictive covenant. The terms of such lease or other instrument must include
provisions guaranteeing:
The continued use of such land for the intended purposes;
Continuity of proper maintenance of those portions of the open space land requiring
maintenance. The developer shall file with the county register of deeds and the
Township Planning Commission legal documents embodying the aforesaid
guarantees ensuring the use of the common open spaces for the designated
purposes. If the development is to be subdivided, such aforementioned restrictions
shall be recorded at the time of final plat approval.
All common open space proposed for dedication to the Township must be acceptable to
it, and may not be so dedicated without approval of the Board of Trustees.
Circulation facilities. Public streets shall be encouraged. However, private streets may be
permitted by approval of the Township Board and the Planning Commission, provided they
are designed to allow sufficient access for emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance) to the
dwelling units they will serve. If private streets are permitted, easements of sufficient width
acceptable to the county road commission shall be granted to the Township in order to

shall be subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
Utilities. Planned unit developments shall, where feasible, provide for underground installation
of utilities (including electricity and telephone) in both public ways and private extensions
thereof. Provisions shall be made for construction of storm sewer facilities including grading,
gutters, piping, and treatment of turf to handle stormwaters, prevent erosion and the formation
of dust. This could include the establishment of retention basins in order to minimize
stormwater runoff. Utilities and maintenance of facilities shall be in accordance with the
requirements and regulations of Meridian Charter Township.
Planting. The appeal and character of the site shall be preserved by retaining and protecting
existing trees and other site features whenever this is practicable. New landscaping shall be
added for privacy, shade, beauty of buildings and grounds and to screen out objectionable
features.

Site plan review. Upon approval by the Township Board of the planned unit development, the
developer shall submit a complete application to the Department of Community Planning and
Development for site plan review, as outlined in the Code of Ordinances. The site plan review
process shall be subject to the standards outlined in Chapter 86 of the Code of Ordinances.
Commencement of construction. No construction shall commence prior to site plan review
approval and issuance of all necessary permits. The applicant shall commence construction
of approved planned unit development within two years following granting of a final site plan
approval or recording of an approved final plat, if such a plat is necessary. Failure to do so will
invalidate the approval. The Planning Commission may grant one extension for not more than
one year; provided, that a request therefore is received by the Department of Community
Planning and Development prior to the expiration of the original two-year approval.
Summary of procedures. A summary of the steps for consideration of planned unit development
permits is as follows:
Preapplication conference or conferences are held with the Director of Community Planning
and Development in order to obtain information and guidance in preparing the application.
Optional sketch plan review with the Planning Commission at a regular and/or work session
meeting.
Application for planned unit development permit is submitted with site plans and descriptive
statement, for preliminary approval. Public hearing is scheduled and held.
Planning Commission recommends either approval or denial of the planned unit development
application to the Township Board.
A public hearing is scheduled and held at the Township Board. The Township Board either
approves or denies the application for planned unit development.
If necessary, a preliminary plat application should be filed with the Planning Commission, as
provided in the Township subdivision regulations. The Township Board certifies if necessary
that the preliminary plat is either approved or denied by the Planning Commission and the
Township Board.
Application for site plan review is submitted.
If necessary, final plat is filed and approved by the Planning Commission and Township
Board.
If within two years after final approval construction does not begin on the planned unit
development, the permit shall be deemed to have expired and terminated. A nonrenewable,
one-year extension of the planned unit development approval may be granted by the Planning
Commission.
Phasing. The establishment of common open space and construction of public or common
recreational facilities shown on the recorded planned unit development plan, together with the
construction of other nonresidential structures, shall proceed in accordance with the phasing
program as set forth in the planned unit development permit. To ensure compliance with the
approved phasing program and to ensure the establishment of common open space and
construction of public or common recreational facilities shown on the approved plan, the Planning
Commission or the Township Board may require the applicant to file with the Township Clerk a
surety bond acceptable to the Township covering up to 25% of the estimated cost of construction
and improvements associated with the entire planned unit development, conditioned upon faithful
completion of the improvements and construction in accordance with the phasing program. After
general construction commences, the Director of Community Planning and Development shall
review, at least once every six months, all building permits and compare them to the overall

development phasing program. If he determines that the rate of construction of residential units or
nonresidential structures substantially differs from the phasing program, he shall notify the
applicant and the Planning Commission in writing. Thereafter, the Planning Commission may
issue such orders to the applicant as will bring the phasing program into proper sequence. Upon
continued violation of the phasing program, the Planning Commission may suspend the applicant
from further construction of dwelling units or nonresidential structures until compliance is achieved
or a new planned unit development permit is obtained. In addition to the foregoing, upon continued
violation of the phasing program for longer than 90 days after an order of the Planning
Commission, the Township shall be entitled to recover a judgment against the applicant or the
surety in the amount of the surety bond.
Amendments.
Generally. Any person who has a property interest in the planned unit development may apply
for an amendment in writing to the Director of Community Planning and Development. The
director shall make a determination as to whether a proposed amendment constitutes a major
or minor amendment to the original planned unit development.
Major amendments. A major amendment shall be evidenced by having a significant impact on
the permit and the conditions of its approval, which shall include, but not be limited to:
Building additions located outside a building envelope as shown on the approved
planned unit development site plan.
For approved planned unit developments without building envelopes, any addition that
reduces the setback between buildings to a dimension less than the standard imposed in
the approved planned unit development site plan.
The addition of land to the planned unit development for the purpose of increasing the
number of residential units.
The addition or expansion of a nonresidential use in the planned unit development.
Expansion of a use that anticipates a 10% or greater increase in required off-street
parking.
Any addition to a legal nonconforming site.
Minor amendments. All projects not deemed to be a major amendment by the Director of
Community Planning and Development shall be considered a minor amendment.
Procedure for processing amendments to existing planned unit developments determined to
be major amendments by the Director of Community Planning and Development. Major
amendments to approved planned unit developments shall follow the same procedure set
forth in this section for new planned unit development applications.
Procedures for processing amendments to existing planned unit developments determined to
be minor amendments by the Director of Community Planning and Development. Upon
determination that the request is a minor amendment, the Director of Community Planning
and Development shall initiate the following review process:
Application. An application for an amendment to a planned unit development shall be
submitted to the Director of Community Planning and Development.
Fee. A fee shall be paid at the time of filing the application in the amount established in
the schedule of fees adopted by the Township Board.
Public hearing. The application of an amended planned unit development shall be subject
to the same notices and hearings and all other procedures required for the initial

Purpose and intent. The purpose of the mixed use planned unit development (mixed use PUD)
section is to create more walkable pedestrian oriented developments by promoting and
accommodating developments in rational mixed patterns that respect Meridian Township's
transitional land use concept to protect, enhance and preserve natural resources. The second
purpose is to encourage rehabilitation of existing structures to include those originally built or
partially built before zoning ordinances were adopted, and in such a manner that will maintain
traditional urban design to preserve and enhance community resources.
The intent of this section is two-fold.
Meet Township goals through well planned, integrated, high quality mixed use in
redevelopment projects:
Enhance health and safety goals by requirements for walkability, pedestrian orientation
and high quality, durable, building materials.
Increase Township prosperity goals and citizen welfare by appreciated property values
which will support necessary public services.
Actualize our cultural heritage through citizen pride in creative, new places to walk to,
shop at and work in that retain a flavor of Meridian Township's rich history.
Enhance diversity goals with new types of residential uses in close-knit community
design.
Improve our natural environment goal by mixed use redevelopment with incentives for
more intensely landscaped buffers and open spaces designed to complement Township
parks and green space plans.
Improve the potential for financially attractive and high quality mixed use projects in the
Township while meeting Township goals of a safe, healthy and sustainable community.
Enhance incentives for investment by the ability to mix residential with commercial and
office uses within the same development.
Allow flexibility in setback and parking requirements.
Encourage redevelopment by allowing increases in density in exchange for providing
specified community amenities.
Achieve attractive and commercially successful core areas through cooperative
development projects with one or more land owners.

Definitions.
AMENITY
Aesthetic, practical or other characteristics of a development that increase its desirability to a
community or its marketability to the public. Amenities may differ from development to
development.
AWNING
A roof-like cover, often fabric, metal, or glass designed and intended for protection from
weather or as a decorative embellishment, and which projects from a wall or roof of a
structure over a window, walk, door, or the like.
BALCONY
A platform that projects from the wall of a building and is surrounded by a railing or
balustrade, for the private use of tenants.
CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY
A style of land development advocating smaller, narrower lots, shallower yards and setbacks,
smaller and more intensely used spaces, etc. that is less land consumptive than traditional
suburban development.
HORTICULTURAL MAINTENANCE PLAN
A written statement documenting the methods to be used to maintain landscaping materials in
a healthy condition, free of refuse and debris.
IMPROVEMENT
Alterations to any structure that do not change the intensity of its use, do not increase the
gross floor area, height, or bulk of the structure by more than 10%, and/or do not block or
impede public access.
MONUMENT SIGN
A freestanding sign, in which the entire bottom (base) is in contact with the ground and is
independent of any other structure.
ORNAMENTAL
Something that is either decorative or something that provides aesthetic quality to an object
required for other purpose.
PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT
Development designed with an emphasis primarily on the street sidewalk and on pedestrian
access to the site and building, rather than on auto access and parking areas with design
bearing a definite relationship to the human dimension. The building is generally placed close
to the street and the main entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk. There are generally
windows or display cases along building facades which face the street. A pedestrian oriented
neighborhood offers variety in housing clustered around well-defined neighborhood centers
which support jobs, commercial activity, and a range of amenities to sustain lively streets and
gathering places. It offers a gradient density from open space to high-intensity commercial
cores. The layout of pathways, streets and transportation corridors minimizes conflict between
walking, biking, and driving.
REDEVELOPMENT
The process by which an existing developed area is rehabilitated, restored, renovated,
expanded and/or adaptively reused. Redevelopment may also mean a site that contains an
existing building(s) to be removed with the approval of the mixed use PUD.

§ 86-441. Grand River Avenue (M-43) Corridor Access
Management Overlay District.
[Ord. No. 2004-06, 9-5-2004]
Findings. A primary function of Grand River Avenue (M-43) is to move traffic through Meridian
Township and to points beyond. As the primary arterial road for Meridian Township and many of
the communities along the corridor, a high percentage of the traffic has an origin and or
destination in the local communities. Thus, Grand River Avenue (M-43) also has a secondary, but
important, function to provide access to adjacent and nearby land uses.
Continued development along the Grand River Avenue M-43 corridor will increase traffic volumes
and introduce additional conflict points which will further erode traffic operations and increase
potential for crashes. Numerous published studies and reports document the relationship between
systems and traffic operations and safety. Those reports and experiences of other communities
demonstrate standards on the number and placement of access points (driveways and side street
intersections) that can preserve the capacity of the roadway and reduce the potential for crashes.
The standards herein are based on recommendations published by various national and Michigan
agencies that were refined during preparation of the M-43/52 Corridor Access Management Plan,
dated July 2003.
The Charter Township of Meridian finds that special comprehensive zoning standards are needed
along the Grand River Avenue (M-43) corridor based upon the following findings:
The combination of roadway design, traffic speeds, current and projected traffic volumes,
traffic crashes and other characteristics necessitate special access standards.
Studies by transportation organizations in Michigan and nationally have found a direct
correlation between the number of access points and the number of crashes.
The standards are based upon considerable research and recommendations contained within
the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) Access Management Handbook.
Preservation of roadway capacity through access management protects the substantial public
investment in the roadway system and helps avoid the need for costly reconstruction, which
disrupts businesses.
Purpose. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has jurisdiction within the highway's
right-of-way, while the Charter Township of Meridian has authority for land use and site plan
decisions within individual lots or parcels along the highway. The access management standards
were created to help ensure a collaborative process between the MDOT and the Charter Township
of Meridian on access decisions along Grand River Avenue (M-43) to implement the
recommendations of the "M-43/52 Corridor Access Management Plan" dated July 2003 and other
adopted Charter Township of Meridian plans.
Among the specific purposes of this corridor access management overlay district are to:
Preserve the capacity of Grand River Avenue (M-43) by limiting and controlling the number,
location and design of access points and requiring alternate means of access through shared
driveways, service drives, and access off cross streets in certain locations.
Encourage efficient flow of traffic by minimizing the disruption and conflicts between through
traffic and turning movements.
Improve safety and reduce the potential for crashes.
Avoid the proliferation of unnecessary curb cuts and driveways, and eliminate or reconfigure
existing access points that do not conform to the standards herein, when the opportunities

arise.
Implement the recommendations of the M-43/52 Corridor Access Management Plan, dated
July 2003.
Require longer frontages or wider minimum lot widths than required in other zoning districts to
help achieve access management spacing standards.
Require coordinated access among adjacent lands where possible.
Require demonstration that resultant lots or parcels are accessible through compliance with
the access standards herein prior to approval of any land divisions to ensure safe accessibility
as required by the Land Division Act.
Address situations where existing development within the corridor area does not conform to
the standards of this overlay district.
Identify additional submittal information and review procedures required for lots or parcels
that front along Grand River Avenue (M-43).
Avoid the need for unnecessary and costly reconstruction, which disrupts business operations
and traffic flow.
Ensure efficient access by emergency and public transportation vehicles.
Improve safety for pedestrians and other nonmotorized travelers through reducing the
number of conflict points at access crossings.
Establish uniform standards to ensure fair and equal application.
Provide landowners with reasonable access, though the access may be restricted to a shared
driveway or service drive or via a side street, or the number and location of access may not
be the arrangement most desired by the landowner or applicant.
Promote a more coordinated development review process for the Charter Township of
Meridian with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Ingham County
Road Commission (ICRC).
Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all lots and parcels with frontage along
Grand River Avenue (M-43) and along intersecting roads within 350 feet of the Grand River
Avenue (M-43) right-of-way (see Figure 86-441.1). The standards herein apply in addition to, and
simultaneously with, the other applicable regulations of the zoning ordinance. Permitted and
special land uses on these lands shall be as regulated in the applicable zoning district (as
designated on the Zoning Map), and shall meet the following additional provisions:

The number of access points is the fewest needed to allow motorists reasonable access to
the site.
Access spacing from intersections and other driveways shall meet the Grand River Avenue
(M-43) access management standards and MDOT's guidelines.
Provision has been made to share access with adjacent uses, either now or in the future,
including any necessary written shared access and maintenance agreements to be recorded
with the county specifying that the Charter Township of Meridian approval is required for any
change to the easement.
No building or structure, nor the enlargement of any building or structure, shall be erected
unless the Grand River Avenue (M-43) access management regulations are met and
maintained in connection with such building, structure, or enlargement.
All subdivisions and condominium projects shall comply with the access spacing standards as
herein demonstrated. Compliance with this section shall be required to demonstrate that a lot
is accessible as required under the Land Division Act (Act 288 of 1967, as amended).
Any change in use that requires a site plan review per § 86-151, the applicant shall identify
the extent of compliance with the standards herein and shall submit information to the MDOT
to determine if a new access permit is required.
For building or parking lot expansions, or changes in use or property, the Director of
Community Planning and Development shall determine the extent of upgrades to bring the
site into greater compliance with the access standards. In making a decision, the Director of
Community Planning and Development shall consider the existing and projected traffic
conditions, any sight distance limitations, site topography or natural features, impacts on
internal site circulation, and any recommendations from the MDOT. Required improvements
may include removal or rearrangement or redesign of site access points.
The standards herein were developed collaboratively between the Charter Township of
Meridian, MDOT and Ingham County Road Commission. Where conflict occurs, the more
restrictive standards shall apply.
Additional submittal information. In addition to the submittal information required for a special use
permit in § 86-124 and site plan review in § 86-15(4), the following information shall be provided

condominium.
Existing access points. Existing access points within 500 feet on both sides of the Grand
River Avenue (M-43) frontage, and along both sides of any adjoining roads, shall be shown
on the site plan, aerial photographs, plat or survey.
The applicant shall submit evidence indicating that the applicable Charter Township of
Meridian's, ICRC or MDOT sight distance requirements are met.
Dimensions between proposed and existing access points shall be shown on the site plan.
Where shared access is proposed or required, a shared access and maintenance agreement
shall be submitted for approval by the Charter Township of Meridian. Once approved, this
agreement shall be recorded with the Ingham County Register of Deeds.
Dimensions shall be provided for driveways (width, radii, throat length, length of any
deceleration lanes or tapers, pavement markings and signs) and all curb radii within the site.
The site plan shall illustrate the route and layout of turning movements, with dimensions of
any expected emergency vehicles, truck traffic, tankers, delivery vehicles, waste receptacle
vehicles and similar vehicles. The plan should confirm that routing the vehicles will not disrupt
operations at the access points nor impede maneuvering or parking within the site.
Traffic impact study. A traffic impact study is required as specified in Subsection 86-124(c)(6).
Review coordination. The applicant shall provide copies of any conceptual or preliminary
plans to the Charter Township of Meridian so copies can be sent to the MDOT or ICRC, as
applicable, and other necessary review agencies for their information and comment. Any
correspondence from the MDOT on the general access design and geometries shall be
considered during the special use permit and site plan review processes. The Charter
Township of Meridian may request attendance at coordination meetings with representatives
of the MDOT or ICRC. Once a final site plan has been approved by the Charter Township of
Meridian, the applicant shall request an access permit from MDOT or the ICRC. The approval
of a land division or site plan does not negate the responsibility of an applicant to
subsequently secure access permits from the MDOT or ICRC.
Access management standards. Access points (not including driveways that serve an essential
public service or utility substation) shall meet the following standards. The spacing standards
specified below shall be required to be measured from all other roads and driveways with the
exception of single-family residential driveways. If there is a change in use from residential to a
nonresidential use, the Director of Community Planning and Development shall require existing
access to be brought into conformance with the requirements of this section. These standards are
based on considerable research in Michigan and nationally, and were prepared concurrent with
guidelines promoted by the MDOT in their Access Management Guidebook.
All subdivisions or condominium projects shall provide individual lot access from roads
internal to the development and no lot shall have direct driveway access to Grand River
Avenue (M-43).
Each lot or parcel shall be permitted one access point. This access point may consist of a
shared access with an adjacent use or access via a service drive, or frontage road. An
individual driveway may be permitted where the standards of this section are met, provided
such driveway is located to facilitate shared access by adjacent lots.
The access point location shall be in accordance with the standards of this section and shall
provide the opportunity for shared access with adjoining lots. Each lot or parcel developed
under this section shall be required to grant shared access easements to adjoining lots or

parcels to allow for future shared access. Where a proposed parking lot is located adjacent to
the parking lot of a similar use, there shall be a vehicular connection where feasible, as
determined by the Director of Community Planning and Development.
In order to comply with the accessibility requirements of the Land Division Act (PA 288 of
1967, as amended), land divisions shall not be permitted that may prevent compliance with
the access location standards of this section.
An additional driveway may be permitted by the Director of Community Planning and
Development pursuant to the requirements of § 86-756(11). The additional driveway may be
required to be along a side street or a shared access with an adjacent site.
Access points shall provide the spacing from other access points along the same side of the
public street (measured from centerline to centerline as shown on the figure) shown in Table
86-441.1, based on the posted speed limit along the public street segment. Required spacing
along Grand River Avenue (M-43) is greater than other roadways to acknowledge MDOT
access guidelines and that their primary function is to accommodate through traffic while the
function of other roads is more balanced with access to properties.

Where a new public or private road is proposed along Grand River Avenue (M-43), the road
shall be aligned and designed to facilitate shared access with adjacent parcels. Where a
private road is proposed running parallel along the side lot line of a parcel, access easements
shall be granted to allow the adjoining lot to have driveway access to the private road. The
Director of Community Planning and Development may require the construction of stub roads
to allow future access to adjoining lots to facilitate future shared access and lateral cross
access.
Shared commercial driveways, frontage roads or rear service drives connecting two or more
lots or uses shall be required in instances where the Director of Community Planning and
Development determines that reducing the number of access points will have a beneficial
impact on traffic operations and safety. In particular, service drives shall be required where
recommended in the M-43/52 Corridor Plan or other sub-area master plans; near existing
traffic signals or near locations having potential for future signalization; where service drives
may minimize the number of driveways; and along segments with a relatively high number of
accidents or limited sight distance. Frontage roads or service drives shall be constructed in
accordance with the following standards:
Service drives shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the front property line and
may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind, principal buildings. In considering
the most appropriate alignment for a service drive, the Director of Community Planning
and Development shall consider the setbacks of existing buildings and anticipated traffic
flow for the site and the M-43/52 Corridor Plan.
The service drive shall be within an access easement permitting traffic circulation
between properties. This easement shall be approved by the Charter Township of
Meridian and recorded with the Ingham County Register of Deeds. The required width
shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless otherwise approved by the Director of
Community Planning and Development. Each property owner shall be responsible for
maintenance of the easement and service drive.
Service drives and frontage roads shall be set back as far as reasonably possible from
the intersection of the access driveway with the public street. As shown in Figure 86-
441.6, a minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between the public street right-of-way
and the pavement of the frontage road, with a minimum 60 feet of throat depth provided
at the access point, measured between the public street right-of-way and the pavement
of the parallel section of the frontage road.

Figure 86-441.6
Service drives shall have a minimum pavement width of 20 feet, depending upon the size
and density of the uses it will serve. They shall be constructed of a base, pavement and
curb with gutter that is in accordance with public street standards. The Director of
Community Planning and Development may modify these standards based upon site
conditions, anticipated traffic volumes and types of truck traffic.
The service drive is intended to be used exclusively for circulation. The Director of
Community Planning and Development may require the posting of "no parking" signs
along the service drive. One-way service drives or two-way service drives constructed
with additional width for parallel parking may be allowed on the side of the road closest to
the building if it can be demonstrated through site plan review or, where required, a traffic
impact study that parking along the service drive will not significantly affect the capacity,
safety or operation of the service drive.
The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service drive at the property line
and Charter Township of Meridian shall maintain a record of all service drive elevations
so that their grades can be coordinated.
The alignment of the service drive can be refined to meet the needs of the site and
anticipated traffic conditions, provided the resulting terminus allows the drive to be
extended through the adjacent site(s). This may require use of aerial photographs,
property line maps, topographic information and other supporting documentation.
In cases where a shared access facility is recommended, but is not yet available,
temporary direct access may be permitted, provided the plan is designed to
accommodate the future service drive, and a written agreement is submitted that the
temporary access will be removed by the applicant, when the alternative access system
becomes available. This may require posting of a financial performance guarantee.
With the redevelopment of existing sites where it is not possible to develop separate
service drives, the Director of Community Planning and Development may instead
require a drive connecting parking lots.
Driveways shall be located to provide safe sight distance, as determined by the applicable
road agency.
No driveway shall interfere with municipal facilities such as street lights or traffic signal poles,
signs, fire hydrants, cross walks, bus loading zones, utility poles, fire alarm supports, drainage
structures, or other necessary street structures. The cost of relocating municipal facilities to
accommodate a driveway, if approved by the Director of Public Works and Engineering, shall
be at the expense of the abutting property owner.

Nonmotorized pathways.
The Director of Community Planning and Development shall require the construction of a
nonmotorized pathway along the Grand River Avenue (M-43) frontage of the site. Where a
phased development or subdivision is proposed, the pathway along the Grand River Avenue
M-43 frontage shall be installed with the initial overall site improvements.
All nonmotorized pathways shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of
Charter Township of Meridian and the MDOT.
Site plan design shall incorporate pedestrian connections between any nonmotorized
pathway along the site frontage and the entrance to the building, with safe delineation of
pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas.
Application to existing sites and modification of standards.
Modifications by Director of Community Planning and Development. Given the variation in
existing physical conditions along the corridor, modifications to the spacing and other
standards above may be permitted by the Director of Community Planning and Development
as part of the site plan review process upon a finding that the following conditions apply:
Practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable, including but
not limited to sight distance limitations, topography, wetlands, drain or water body,
woodlands that will be preserved, existing development, existing nonconforming width,
unique site configuration or shape, or existing off-site access points make it impractical to
fully comply with the standards.
The use involves an access improvement to an existing site or a new use that will not
generate any more traffic than the previous use or there is only one access point that is
not being changed.
The proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the preceding
standards, the recommendations of the M-43/52 corridor access management plan,
dated July 2003, MDOT guidelines, and both Charter Township of Meridian and MDOT
staff support the proposed access design.
If deemed necessary by the Director of Community Planning and Development, a traffic
study, prepared in accordance with § 86-441(d)(7) has been provided that certifies the
modification will improve traffic operations and safety along Grand River Avenue (M-43),
and is not simply for convenience of the development. Roadway or intersection control or
driveway design change improvements will be made to improve overall traffic operations
prior to the project completion or occupancy of the first building.
Indirect or shared access has been provided to the extent practical.
The Director of Community Planning and Development may require that the access provided
under this section be a temporary driveway that is issued for a set period of time or until an
adjacent site develops allowing for shared access in accordance with this section. The
Director of Community Planning and Development may require that a performance guarantee
or other legally binding means approved by Charter Township of Meridian be provided to
ensure the removal of the driveway upon expiration of the temporary driveway permit.
The decision by the Director of Community Planning and Development under this section may
be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals. In consideration of this appeal, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall also apply the standards above in addition to the other appeal criteria.

The purpose of this section is to protect, preserve and provide trees along and near streets within the
Township; to provide for public health, safety, and general welfare gained from the visual aesthetics, air
purification, and traffic-calming benefits of trees; to promote and retain the Township's natural beauty;
and to identify, address, mitigate and resolve concerns regarding trees during the design phase of
projects.
New street trees. New street trees shall be planted as part of any nonresidential or multiple-family
developments, planned unit developments (PUD), mixed-use planned unit developments

Tree size. New street trees shall be at least two inches in caliper when planted. Any tree
which dies within two years after planting shall be replaced by the developer.
Existing trees. In an effort to preserve viable existing trees and in lieu of planting new street trees,
existing trees located in the right-of-way of all street classifications may be preserved and used as
street trees subject to the approval of the Director of Community Planning and Development with
input from the Ingham County Road Department or Michigan Department of Transportation, as
applicable. The following minimum standards shall be utilized for all existing trees located within
the right-of-way:
Existing trees shall be identified by species and diameter at breast height (dbh) on plans
submitted with applications for special use permits, planned unit developments (PUD), mixeduse
planned unit developments (MUPUD), commercial planned unit developments (CPUD),
and site plans if one or both of the following are proposed:
An applicant proposes to retain an existing street tree in lieu of planting a new tree.
An applicant proposes to remove one or more existing street trees located in the right-ofway
abutting a development site and demonstrates the lack of feasible or prudent
alternatives without causing undue hardship.
Evaluation of existing street trees for either substitution for a new street tree or for
preservation shall be based on the following criteria: desirability of the existing tree's species,
form, size, age, location and physical condition.
The preservation of individual existing trees meeting the criteria above should have priority
over the design and location of proposed streets, access drives, and infrastructure when there
are other practical alternatives to removing the tree(s).
The Township may impose conditions on the method and extent of the proposed activities in
the right-of-way, as necessary, to ensure they will be conducted in a manner which will
minimize damage, encroachment, or interference with the health and well-being of the tree(s).
Tree protection measures identified in § 22-179 of the Code of Ordinances may be required to
assure the health and well-being of each existing tree to be preserved. Activities should not
be conducted within the drip line of the tree, including but not limited to placing solvents,
material, machinery, vehicles, or soil.
One replacement deciduous tree shall be planted for each preserved existing tree that dies
within two years after completion of the project. Tree species and planting locations are
subject to the approval of the Director of Community Planning and Development. Trees shall
be a minimum of two inches in diameter.

Cross reference: Buildings and building regulations, ch. 14.
State law reference: Nonconforming uses, MCL 125.286.
§ 86-616. Generally.
[Code 1974, § 83-6.1]
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this chapter and subsequent
amendments uses of land, structures, and uses of land and structures together which were lawful
before this chapter was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendments, herein referred to as nonconformities.
It is the intent of this chapter to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue
until they are removed or abandoned but not to encourage their continuance.
Such nonconformities are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. The regulations in this division are designed to ensure that such nonconformities
are properly regulated so as to minimize disharmony with the uses and structures in conformance
with this chapter. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged
upon, expanded or extended, except as set forth herein, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun in
reliance upon a validly issued building permit prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual
construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner.
§ 86-617. Nonconforming uses of land.
[Code 1974, § 83-6.2]
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a formerly lawful use of land
exists that is prohibited under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be
continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater
area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
No such nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the
lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
A nonconforming use of land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by
addition of other uses that are not permitted in the district involved.
If a nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of three consecutive months, or
for nine months during any three-year period, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to

[Code 1974, § 83-6.3]
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that
would be prohibited under the terms of this chapter, as adopted or amended, by reason of restrictions
on building area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on
the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
Nonconforming single-family structures may be altered, expanded, or modernized without prior
approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals; provided, that such structural alteration or extension
shall not increase the extent of the nonconformity and shall satisfy all other applicable site
development regulations.
Nonconforming structures, other than single-family structures, may be altered, expanded, or
modernized without prior approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals; provided, that structural
alterations or extensions shall not increase the area, height, bulk, use, or extent of the structure
and shall satisfy all other applicable site development regulations.
If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its
replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation, it may be reconstructed only in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. The estimated cost of reconstruction shall be determined by a Chief
Building Inspector. Persons aggrieved by the determination of estimated replacement cost by the
Chief Building Inspector may appeal such determination to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
If a nonconforming structure is moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
§ 86-619. Nonconforming uses of structures and land.
[Code 1974, § 83-6.4]
If a lawful use of a structure or structure and land in combination exists at the effective date of adoption

adopted or amended, the formerly lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
No existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use may be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless the use of the structure is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which it is located.
The portion of a structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall not be increased, expanded, or
enlarged, nor shall any additional nonconforming uses be added to the existing nonconforming
use.
If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in
combination may be changed to another nonconforming use; provided, that the Zoning Board of
Appeals finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
require conditions and safeguards in accordance with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
Where a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination is hereafter
changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
If a structure or structure and land in combination formerly devoted to a nonconforming use is
changed to a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which

structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance
with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When a seasonal nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land in combination is discontinued or ceases to exist for two
consecutive seasons, the structure or structure and land in combination shall not be used except
in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
If a structure or structure and land in combination devoted to a nonconforming use is removed or
destroyed the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished and the land shall be used in
conformance with this chapter.
§ 86-620. Repairs and maintenance.
[Code 1974, § 83-6.5]
Any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use may be repaired to correct
deterioration or wear or by replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing to an
extent not exceeding 50% of the assessed value of the building; provided, that the area, height,
bulk, use, or extent of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this
chapter shall not be increased.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition any building or part of any building declared to be unsafe by an official charged with
protecting the public safety.
§ 86-621. Change of tenancy or ownership.
[Code 1974, § 83-6.6]

[Code 1974, § 86-1]
Purpose. In order to accommodate the new types of diversified residential developments of
medium and high density, usually requiring a large tract of unplatted land, the construction of
group housing developments in any multiple-family residential district may be authorized by the
Planning Commission by issuance of a special use permit when all the procedures and
requirements of this chapter can be complied with. The term "group housing" refers to those types
of residential structures customarily known as garden-apartments, terrace-apartments, row
housing, townhouses, and other similar types of multiple housing either leased or sold as
condominium dwellings.
Requirements. The requirements of § 86-376(e), procedure for obtaining special use permits in

§ 86-655. Planned community and regional shopping center
developments.
[Code 1974, § 86-5; Ord. No. 2004-06, 9-5-2004]
Purpose.
The increasing use of the grouped type of retail sales and service establishments planned
and constructed as a unit, located on a single, unified site, arranged for the convenience of
the automobile-conveyed customer, and designed to effect efficiency and an attractive,
pleasing environment for both the businessman and the customer cannot be provided for
equitably in a zoning ordinance by any one of the customary business district classifications.
The grouping of store units making up a community or regional shopping center range in size
and in the types from the relatively small neighborhood shopping center, furnishing principally
daily necessities to immediate residents, up to the large type of shopping center furnishing
most types of consumer goods and services to the community at large, and even to the urban
region, functioning in much the same way as a conventional central business district.
In recognition of the unique and changing characteristics of this type of business facility,
provisions are established in this section for the Township to accommodate and to encourage
the construction and operation of shopping centers to the extent and in accordance with such
standards which will result in the optimum future development of the Township community.
Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term "shopping center" shall mean a business or
group of businesses engaging in retail sales or service arranged as a functionally coherent unit,
together with the pertinent features, such as parking areas and storage facilities. The terms
"shopping center" and "planned shopping development" are interchangeable for purposes of this

Off-street parking requirements. The off-street parking requirements of Article VIII of this
chapter shall apply.
External access. Except as provided in § 86-441, the Grand River Avenue (M-43) Corridor
Access Management Overlay District, external access to the center shall be directly provided
by a principal or minor arterial shown in § 86-367, Further, the proponent shall show, to the
complete satisfaction of the Township Planning Commission, that such external access on
any street or highway shall be fully capable of absorbing the maximum hourly traffic
anticipated to be generated by the center without undue interference to other traffic on any
street.

standards, shall be located closer to any property line of the center than a distance equal to
twice its height.
Signs. Signs shall comply with the provisions of Article VII of this chapter.
Transition Strips. All planned shopping center developments, when located adjacent to a
residential district or when located adjacent to a school, hospital, or other public institution,
shall include as an addition to and as an integral part of the site development a strip of land
50 feet or more in width on all sides of the site except on any side abutting a major street or
highway. All distances shall be computed from the street or highway right-of-way lines in
accordance with § 86-367 for the type of street or highway upon which the shopping center
abuts. This strip shall serve as a transition between the shopping center land use and
adjacent property uses, both existing and future. No part of this transition strip shall be used
for any of the shopping center functions, except that up to 20 feet of the strip width on the
interior side may be used as part of the parking area. To secure the optimum effect of
transition, the strip shall be occupied by plant materials or structural fences and walls, used
separately or in combination, except for any part that may be occupied by parking space. The
plans and specifications for the gross site development shall include the proposed
arrangement of such planting and structures and shall thereby be subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission.
§ 86-656. Miscellaneous special uses.
[Code 1974, § 86-6]
Purpose. Land and structure uses that, because of functional and other inherent characteristics,
have a high potential of being injurious to surrounding properties by depreciating quality and value
of such property and of being generally injurious to the community as a whole unless held to

§ 86-759. Parking deferral.
[Code 1974, § 85-1.16]
The purpose of this section is to eliminate unsightly expanses of unused paved areas,
unnecessary levels of accelerated stormwater runoff, excess radiated heat from paved surfaces,
and the premature loss of open space by permitting such uses to develop with reduced numbers
of constructed off-street parking spaces while retaining additional site area for possible future offstreet
parking use, where appropriate.
The following provisions apply:
For uses requiring a special use permit, other than multiple-family projects, the Planning
Commission, or the Township Board on appeal, may defer the construction of all or part of the
required off-street parking during its review of the application for a special use permit,
provided the requested deferral complies with the standards of this division.
For uses subject to site plan review only, the Director of Community Planning and
Development, subject to appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals, may defer the construction of
all or part of the required off-street parking during the review of the application for site plan
review, provided the requested deferral complies with the standards of this division.
Where a parking construction deferral is requested, the applicant shall submit the following
information with the application for a special use permit or site plan review:
A written statement describing the characteristics of the proposed project that justify the
requested parking deferral.
The site plan submitted with an application for a special use permit or site plan review for
the property shall indicate all required parking, parking lot landscaping, and other
information necessary to determine compliance with all requirements of this article. The
site plan shall also indicate that area where parking construction will be deferred, the
number of parking stalls for which deferral is proposed, and the number of parking stalls

to be constructed. The site plan will note that the area where parking will be deferred is to
be reserved for future parking, will be maintained as landscaped open space, and may
not be used for any other purposes.
Areas of land where parking construction has been deferred shall be landscaped and
maintained with grass or other acceptable plant materials. If that area is not disturbed during
construction, it may, with the approval of the Planning Commission, or director for site plan
review only, be maintained in its natural vegetative condition existing prior to development,
provided the natural vegetation is in keeping with the general appearance of the area.
Seasonal overflow parking may be permitted in reserved areas where open-cell grass pavers,
or other engineered surfaces capable of maintaining grass growth and supporting vehicles,
are used. Use of seasonal overflow parking areas shall not exceed 15 cumulative days in one
year.
Areas where parking construction has been deferred shall not be used to satisfy interior
landscaping, buffer, pervious surface, or stormwater retention or detention requirements of
this article or other agency having jurisdiction.
That portion of the proposed parking lot which will be constructed shall be landscaped to
comply with the parking area landscaping requirements of this article as applied to a parking
lot of the size actually constructed.
In addition to the requirements in subsections (b)(1)—(7) of this section approval for deferral
of parking lot construction shall be granted only upon finding that the proposal will provide
adequate off-street parking for the proposed use.
In approving a parking deferral, the Planning Commission or Director of Community Planning
and Development, or the Township Board or Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal, may
prescribe such conditions regarding the character, location, landscaping, and other features
that will secure the objectives and purposes of this article.
The approved parking deferral and any conditions related to such deferral shall be described
in a parking construction deferral agreement between the Township and the applicant and
recorded with the county register of deeds. The parking construction deferral agreement shall
include a provision that grants the Township a license to come on the subject property and
construct the deferred parking at the property owner's cost if the property owner refuses or
neglects to construct the deferred parking as directed by the Township and a provision that
the cost for such construction may be added to the tax roll under Chapter 46 of this Code if
not timely paid by the property owner.
The owner of property for which a parking deferral has been granted shall submit any request
to increase or change the use or occupancy of the property to the Director of Community
Planning and Development prior to such increase or change. If the Director of Community
Planning and Development determines that the increased or changed use may affect the
property's parking needs, a request to review the parking deferral shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section. The Director of
Community Planning and Development may approve a request to increase or change a use
subject to site plan review in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this section. Any changes
in the approved parking deferral shall be incorporated in a recorded agreement as provided in
subsection (b)(10) of this section.
The owner of property for which a parking deferral has been granted may, at his discretion,
construct all or part of the deferred parking if the need arises.
The Township shall require the full or partial construction of the deferred parking upon a
determination of an ongoing demonstrated need for additional parking or a violation of the
terms and conditions of the parking construction deferral agreement. An ongoing
