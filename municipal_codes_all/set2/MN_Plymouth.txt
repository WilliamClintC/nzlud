Code 
 
 
City of Plymouth, Minnesota 
Updated through March 1, 2019 
 
FOREWORD 
 
 
 This book contains a codification of the ordinances of the City of Plymouth, Minnesota, pursuant to authority granted the Council by Minnesota Statutes and the Charter for the City of Plymouth.  It is known and should be cited as the "City Code". 
 
 The ordinances of the City were previously codified in 1969 and rearranged in 1979.  Over the years, as the number of ordinances increased with the growth of the City and with the adoption of a City Charter, the City Council wisely determined that a complete and detailed recodification was essential in order to keep the City Code up-to-date as to the current law.  In this codification some of the original ordinances have been supplemented by essential legislative enactments.  Most ordinances retain their same number. 
 
 This codification, arrangement and format seeks to facilitate keeping the City Code up-to-date and the amending procedure less cumbersome and expensive.  The City Code is organized to accomplish:  (1) elimination of repetition and non-essentials; (2) easy revision and ease of incorporation of new ordinances; (3) comprehensiveness; and, (4) ease of locating a particular subject or provision. 
 
 The reader will find a Table of Contents outlining the full text of the City Code.  This Table is designed to make local law more accessible to laypersons.

Section 435 – Hospitality Accommodations 
 
 
435.01. Findings and Intent.  Subdivision. 1.  The City desires that hotel and motel owners provide safe Hospitality Accommodations. 
 
Subd. 2.  The Council determines it is in the best interests of the City to take a proactive approach to deterring and minimizing criminal activity and minimizing safety concerns at the hotels and motels within the City of Plymouth. 
 
Subd. 3.  The Council desires to encourage and foster cooperation between hotel and motel operations in the City, so calls for service initiated by the hotel or motel operator should not be included in the calls for service calculations for the purposes of these regulations. 
 
Subd. 4.  The level of criminal activity occurring at hotels and motels in the City is a real and compelling concern to the Council, residents, visitors, and the hotel and motel industry itself. 
 
Subd. 5.  A review of the police service calls regarding criminal activity demonstrates that some hotels and motels in the City are responsible for a disproportionate number of those calls. 
 
Subd. 6.  It is reasonable to require hotels and motels with a higher number of police calls for service to employ certain measures that have been shown to be effective in deterring crime. 
 
Subd. 7.  To account for differences in the number of lodging units among the hotels and motels, and to avoid larger properties being disproportionately represented, it is appropriate to consider the number of calls for service based on a per-lodging unit calculation for the purposes of determining the level of business license required. 
 
Subd. 8.  The license required by this ordinance is a business license issued under the City's general police powers and is not intended to regulate items addressed in a Minnesota Department of Health required of hotels and motels under Minnesota law.

Section 508 –Premature Subdivision Prohibited 
 
 
508.01. Premature Subdivision Prohibited.  Any proposed subdivision deemed premature for development shall not be approved by the Council.  A subdivision shall be deemed premature if the Council determines that any of the following conditions exist.  The burden of proof shall be upon the subdivider to show that the proposed subdivision is not premature.  
 
Subd. 1.  Inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives, development staging plan, or recommendations of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, as may be amended.  Application for reguiding and/or rezoning may be made simultaneously with an application for subdivision approval, however, a subdivision application will not be considered for approval by the Council until and unless any necessary reguiding and/or rezoning application is approved by the Council. 
 
Subd. 2.  Inconsistent with the Capital Improvements Program.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the capital improvements program because public improvements, facilities, or services necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision would not be completed within two years of the date of application. 
 
Subd. 3.  Lack of Adequate Water Supply.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if public water is not available to serve the proposed subdivision. 
 
Subd. 4.  Lack of Adequate Waste Disposal Systems.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if: 
 
A. Sanitary sewer is neither available nor proposed; or 
 
B. Available or proposed sanitary sewer is inadequate to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density after reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools, public facilities, and other developments planned within five years of the date of application. 
 
Subd. 5.  Lack of Adequate Streets to Serve the Subdivision.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if: 
 
A. Streets which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade, stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance or surface condition that the traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare, or would seriously aggravate an existing hazardous condition; or 
 
B. The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create congestion or unsafe conditions on existing or proposed streets. 
 
Plymouth City Code      508.01, Subd. 6(a) 
 
 
Subd. 6.  Lack of Adequate Drainage.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if: 
 
A. Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it constitutes a hazard to the stability of proposed or existing structures; or 


 
B. The proposed subdivision would cause pollution of water sources or would cause damage from erosion or siltation on downstream property; or 


 
C. Factors including, but not limited to, the presence of floodplain, poor soils or subsoils, or steep slopes exist in such a manner as to preclude adequate site drainage or treatment of runoff. 


 
Subd. 7.  Inconsistent with Environmental Requirements.  A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the rules and policies of the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board, as may be amended, and could adversely impact critical environmental areas, or potentially disrupt or destroy, in violation of State historical preservation laws, historic areas which are designated or officially recognized by the Council.

522.13. Release and Expiration of Financial Guarantees. 
 
Subd. 1.  The financial guarantee shall be held by the City until, upon written notice by the subdivider and certification from a professional engineer that part or all of the required improvements have been completed and upon verification of such by the City staff, a portion or  
Plymouth City Code       522.13, Subd. 1 
 
 
all of the financial guarantee is released by the City.  No financial guarantee shall be released in full until the City Engineer has received 1) certified, reproducible record plans of all required improvements installed by the subdivider and 2) a title insurance policy approved by the City Attorney indicating that the improvements are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. 
 
Subd 2.  It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to ensure that a submitted financial guarantee shall continue in full force and effect until the City has approved and accepted all of the required improvements, and thereby is authorized to release the guarantee as provided in Subd. 1 above. 
 
Subd. 3.  When any instrument submitted as a financial guarantee contains provision for an expiration date, after which the instrument may not be drawn upon, not withstanding the status of the Development Contract or of the required improvements, the expiration date shall be October 31 or the closest business day in the case of weekends and legal holidays.  Further, the financial guarantee shall be deemed automatically extended without change for successive one-year terms from the original expiration date unless, at least 60 days prior to the expiration date or next annual renewal date, the financial institution notifies the City in writing by certified mail that it does not elect to renew the financial guarantee for an additional period.  If the instrument is not to be renewed and has not been released by the City, another acceptable financial guarantee in the appropriate amount shall be submitted at least 60 days prior to the expiration.  Upon receipt of an acceptable substitute financial guarantee, the City may release the original guarantee.

Section 524 – Design Standards 
 
 
524.01. General Standards. 
 
Subd. 1.  Contiguous Land.  A preliminary plat shall include all of the owner’s contiguous land, unless subdivision of property contiguous to the subdivision would be premature as defined by this Chapter.  If subdivision of the contiguous property owned by the applicant would be premature, the applicant shall submit a sketch plan with enough detail to demonstrate how that property can be subdivided in the future in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and this Chapter.  Final platting may be accomplished in phases.   
 
Subd. 2.  Subdivisions Straddling Municipal Boundaries.  Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land in another city, the City shall request assurance from the affected city that access is legally established and that the access road is adequately improved or that a guarantee has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road.  In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines. 
 
Subd. 3.  Monuments. 
 
A. Official permanent monuments shall be placed as required by Minnesota Statutes, Section 505.02 (as may be amended). 


 
B. All monument markers shall be correctly in place upon final grading and installation of utilities.  


 
C. The City will not issue building permits for a lot within a plat until monuments have been placed for that lot.   


 
D. All United States, state, county or other official bench marks, monuments or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved in precise position. 


 
Subd. 4.  Subdivision Names.  The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the City.  The City shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision. 
 
Subd. 5.  Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  Public and private improvements shall comply with standards set forth in the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications, which are herein adopted by reference.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 
 
524.03. Lot Improvements. 
 
Plymouth City Code       524.03, Subd. 1 
 
 
Subd. 1.  Lot Arrangement.  The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance.  In addition, all lots shall abut and have direct access to an improved street except for developments with unit lots, in which case the base lot shall abut and have direct access to an improved street. 
 
Subd. 2.  Minimum Lot Dimensions.  All lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Zoning Ordinance.  Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial, office or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance. 
 
Subd. 3.  Side Lot Lines.  Side lines of lots shall be substantially at right angles to street lines and substantially radial to curved street lines, unless an alternative layout will result in a better street or lot plan. 
 
 Subd. 4.  Corner Lots.  Corner lots shall be of sufficient width and depth to comply with the minimum building setback requirement from both streets and to comply with the minimum driveway setback from the intersection, as established in the Zoning Ordinance. 
 
 Subd. 5.  Through or Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots. 
 
A. Through or Double Frontage Lots.  Through or double frontage lots shall not be permitted except where lots back on an arterial roadway or where specific disadvantages of topography or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable.   


 
B. Access from Minor Arterials and Major Collectors.  Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a minor arterial or major collector roadway.  No lot parallel to a minor arterial or major collector roadway and having a width of less than 200 feet should front on these roadways unless 1) access is limited to streets other than a minor arterial or major collector, 2) access is provided jointly with other lots or 3) access is ultimately to be provided from a planned frontage road.  Where possible, driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on minor arterial or major collector roadways.  (Ord. 2005-02, 1/11/2005) 
 
Subd. 6.  Lots Abutting Water.  Lots abutting a water body, wetland, drainage way, channel, stream or pond shall be of sufficient width and depth and at the elevation needed to assure that building sites are not subject to flooding.  The platting of lots within the floodplain is subject to the Zoning Ordinance provisions relating thereto. 
 
Subd. 7.  Large Tracts.  When a parcel of land is subdivided into larger tracts than for building lots, such tracts shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets and utilities. 
Plymouth City Code       524.03, Subd. 8 
 
 
Subd. 8.  Lot Remnants.  All remnants of land which are below the minimum lot size or which are otherwise unbuildable must be added to adjacent lots and shall not be platted as an unusable outlot or parcel. 
 
Subd. 9.  Soil Preservation, Grading and Sodding/Seeding. 
 
A. Final Grading.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the approved final subdivision plat.  (Ord. 2014-13, 1/25/2014) 


 
B. Lot Drainage.  Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area.  Where possible, drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm water drainage from each lot to adjacent lots. 


 
C. Sodding/Seeding.  Sodding and seeding shall be done in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance and the Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 


 
Subd. 10.  Debris and Waste.  No cut trees, diseased trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and removal of those items and materials shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy in a subdivision.  No items and materials as described in the preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the Development Contract or dedication of public improvements, whichever occurs sooner. 
 
Subd. 11.  Waterbodies and Watercourses.  If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots.  The City may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a City responsibility. 
 
 Subd. 12.  Subdivision of Land within Floodplain Overlay Districts. 
 
A. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities.  All such proposals shall minimize flood damage and ensure that all utilities, water supply or sewage treatment facilities are adequately located and protected.  Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this ordinance. 


 
B. All lots within the Floodplain Overlay Districts shall contain a building site outside of the Floodplain Overlay District that is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 


Plymouth City Code       524.03, Subd. 12 
 
 
C. All subdivisions shall have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 


 
Subd. 13.  Subdivision of Flood Prone Areas.  If a subdivision proposal is in a flood prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that: 
 
A. All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood prone area. 


 
B. All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 


 
C. Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard. 


 
(Ord. 2016-30, 10/25/2016) 
 
524.05. Streets. 
 
 Subd. 1. General Requirements, Streets. 
 
 A. Topography and Arrangement. 
 
1. The arrangement, character, extent, width, and location of all streets shall be considered in relation to existing and planned streets, shall provide for reasonable traffic circulation and traffic calming, and shall be appropriately located in relation to topography, run-off of storm water, convenience and safety, and proposed uses of the land to be served.  Wherever possible, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall provide for the continuation of existing and planned streets within and outside the proposed plat.  Where adjoining lands are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into adjoining lands by carrying the streets to the boundaries of the plat.  The arrangement of streets shall not cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it. 


 
2. Local streets shall be designed and aligned to discourage their use by non-local traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 


 
3. Neighborhoods shall be interconnected where possible to provide for emergency access, convenience, dispersal and circulation of traffic and to foster community cohesiveness.   


Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 1 
 
 
4. In commercial and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the location of buildings, rail facilities, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and sidewalks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian traffic. 


 
B. Grading and Improvement Plan.  The full width of the street right-of-way shall be graded and improved in conformance with the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications and the construction plans submitted as part of the final plat application.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008)  


 
C. Blocks. 


 
1. A block shall normally be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots, unless it adjoins a railroad, arterial or collector street, lake, wetland, park, stream, or other natural feature, where it may have a single tier of lots. 


 
2. Block length and width or acreage within bounding streets shall be sufficient to accommodate the size of lots required by the Zoning Ordinance and to provide for convenient access, circulation control and safety of street traffic.  Residential block lengths shall not exceed 900 feet nor be less than 500 feet, except where topography or other conditions 


 
justify a departure from that standard.  Commercial and industrial block lengths shall not exceed 900 feet nor be less than 500 feet, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from that standard. 
 
D. Access. 


 
1. Vehicle access shall be prohibited from a stub street to adjoining lots until such time as the stub street is extended into an adjoining tract, or unless a temporary cul-de-sac is provided.  The City Engineer may grant an exception to this provision if:  1)  the terminus of the dead-end stub street and related barricade required under Section 524.05, Subd. 1. K. 2. of this section is visible from the nearest intersection, and 2)  snow plows, garbage trucks, and other vehicles servicing the homes accessing the stub street would not need to back into a collector or arterial roadway in order to exit the stub street.  (Ord. 2013-12, 4/23/2013) 


 
Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 1 
 
 
2. When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of an existing or planned principal or minor arterial roadway, the Council may require dedication and installation of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way for adequate protection of properties and to afford a separation of local and through traffic.  Such streets shall be located at a distance from the major roadway suitable for the appropriate use of any intervening land.  Such distance shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach connections, future grade separations, and lot depths. 


 
3. The subdivider shall provide access to all lots via local streets. When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of a principal arterial, vehicle access points shall be restricted in accordance with the City’s Comprehensive Plan and the access requirements of the Minnesota Department of Transportation and Hennepin County.  When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of a minor arterial or major collector roadway, vehicle access points shall be restricted from such roadways.  If access onto a minor arterial or major collector is the only option for access and is therefore required, such vehicle access points shall be limited from individual lots onto such streets through the use of shared driveways, consistent with the access management provisions of the City’s Comprehensive Plan.   


 
4. Access to minor arterial and major collector streets shall be at intervals of not less than .25 mile, and through existing and established crossroads where possible.  In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on minor arterial streets where there is no other alternative, a temporary access permit may be granted.  As neighboring land becomes subdivided and access to other streets becomes possible, such temporary access permit shall become void. 


 
5. When a residential lot has frontage on multiple streets, access to such lot shall be prohibited from higher-order streets (e.g., a lot that fronts on a minor arterial street and a collector street shall be prohibited from having access on the minor arterial street, and a lot that fronts on a collector street and a local street shall be prohibited from having access on the collector street). 


 
E. Street Names.  Street names shall be designated by the City street naming system, as administered by the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning Administrator shall have discretion to alter the City street naming system, when appropriate, in order to avoid confusion to the traveling public.  A petition to rename a street shall require action by the Council. 


Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 1 
 
 
F. Street Regulatory Signs.  Street signs of standard design approved by the City shall be installed at each street intersection or at such other locations within the subdivision as designated by the City Engineer. 


 
G. Traffic Control Signs.  Traffic control signs pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 169.06, shall be installed at locations within the subdivision as designated by the City Engineer. 


 
H. Turn Lanes and Traffic Lights.  Turn lanes and traffic lights shall be installed at the expense of the subdivider when required as a result of the proposed subdivision. 


 
I. Street Lights.  Street lights shall be installed at all intersections and at other locations, as required by the City Engineer.  All street lights within new subdivisions shall be on ornamental poles with underground electrical service, and shall conform to City lighting standards.  (Ord. 2013-12, 4/23/2013) 


 
J. Sidewalks and Trails.  Required sidewalks and trails shall be installed at the time a street is constructed. 


 
K. Dead-End Streets, Stub Streets and Cul-de-Sac Streets (permanent and temporary). 


 
1. Dead-End Streets.  Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stub streets. 


 
2. Stub Streets.  Stub streets shall be installed to permit future street extensions into adjoining tracts, where appropriate. Barricades shall be installed at the end of stub streets and signage shall be provided indicating a future street connection.  Stub streets shall not exceed 150 feet in length.   


 
3. Cul-de-Sac Streets (permanent). Cul-de-sac streets may be installed where necessary due to topography, configuration of land, existing road layouts or other special circumstances. 


 
4. Cul-de-Sac Streets (temporary).  In those instances where a street is terminated pending future extension in conjunction with future platting and its terminus is located 150 feet or more from the nearest intersection, a temporary cul-de-sac with a pavement width of 70 feet in diameter shall be provided at the closed end.  Any portion of a temporary cul-de-sac not located within the street right-of-way shall be placed in a temporary roadway easement extending at least 10 feet beyond the curb line of the temporary cul-de-sac in all directions.  No building permit shall be issued for any properties containing such temporary easement until after the temporary cul-de-sac is constructed.  A financial guarantee will be required for removal and restoration, as required by the Development 


Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 1 
 
 
Contract for the subdivision. 
 
L. Alleys and Private Streets. 


 
1. Alleys.  No new alleys are allowed. 


 
 2. Private Streets.  Private streets are prohibited.  Private drives serving more than one residential unit are regulated by the Zoning Ordinance. 
 
Subd. 2.  Design Standards, Streets. 
 
A. General.  In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and general improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for streets are hereby required. 


 
B. Street Surfacing and Improvements.  After the subdivider has installed sewer and water, the subdivider shall construct poured-in-place concrete curbs and gutters and shall surface streets to the width prescribed in this Chapter.  Types of pavement shall be as prescribed in the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains and bridges.  The portion of the right-of-way outside the area surfaced shall be sodded.  All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications in the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the subdivider for final plat approval.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 


 
C. Right-of-Way Width. 


 
1. Minimum right-of-way width for minor arterial and collector streets shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan.  When not provided in the Comprehensive Plan, the minimum right-of-way shall be as follows: 


 
 
Street Type 
 Right-of-Way Width 
 
Minor Arterial 
 100 feet 
 
Major Collector 
 80 feet 
 
Minor Collector 
 60 feet 
 

Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 2 
 
 
2. The right-of-way width for local streets shall be determined by the City Engineer and shall be adequate to accommodate pavement width and other improvements required within the right-of-way.  The right-of-way width for local streets shall generally be 50 feet. 
 
3. In order to ensure safety and accommodate existing and future street intersections, bridge overpasses, railway crossings, interchanges, topography and the like, the City may require dedication of a greater right-of-way width than specified above. 
 
 4. A subdivider may be required to install landscaped medians for certain minor arterial and collector roadways platted within the subdivision, in accordance with roadway standards established by the City Engineer and landscape standards established by the City Forester. 
 
D. Railroads and Principal Arterials.  Railroad rights-of-way and principal arterials where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 


 
1. In residential districts, lots abutting railroad rights-of-way and principal arterials shall have sufficient lot depth required to accommodate any additional structure setbacks provided by the Zoning Ordinance.   


 
2. In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad right-of-way shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance from the railroad right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 


 
3. When streets parallel to the railroad right-of-way intersect a street that crosses the railroad right-of-way at grade, they shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way.  Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the 


 
minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
 
E. Pavement Width. 


 
1. Minimum pavement width for minor arterial and collector streets, as measured from back of curb to back of curb, shall be in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.  When not shown in the Comprehensive Plan, the minimum pavement width for minor arterial and collector streets shall be determined by the City Engineer based on anticipated traffic volume. 


 
Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 2 
 
 
2. Minimum pavement width for local streets, as measured from back of curb to back of curb, shall be as follows: 


 
Local Street Type 
 Pavement Width 
 
Non-Residential  
 36 feet 
 
Residential  
 28 feet 
 
Residential, Low Volume  
 24 feet 
 

 
Low volume local street means a street with an average daily traffic count of less than 500.  On such streets, where a narrower pavement width would help preserve natural resources or are needed due to manmade constraints, the minimum pavement width may be reduced to a minimum of 21 feet.   
 
F. Cul-de-Sac Street Turnarounds and Length. 


 
1. Turnarounds.  Cul-de-sacs shall provide a turn-around with a minimum right-of-way diameter of 100 feet and a minimum pavement diameter of 82 feet (back of curb to back of curb).  Lot lines that directly abut the turnaround shall be radial to the center of the cul-de-sac.  Lot lines and curb lines at the intersection of the straight portion of the street and the turnaround shall be rounded with a radius of not less than 20 feet.  Residential cul-de-sacs may include a center island within the turn-around for snow storage.  Maintenance of such center islands shall become the responsibility of a Homeowners Association for the subdivision.  The pavement width between the outside curb of the turn-around and such island shall be a minimum of 28 feet wide. 


 
2. Length:  The length of a permanent cul-de-sac shall be as follows: 


 
a. Up to 500 feet, as measured from the centerline of the intersection of origin to the end of the cul-de-sac right-of-way. 



 
b. Between 500 and 750 feet, provided the following requirements are met:  1) fire flows meet City requirements and looping of the water system will be provided or is planned for, 2) there is a secondary access unless waived by the Council and 3) the street design incorporates features such as curves, signage and/or additional turnarounds sufficient to minimize traffic backtracking, limit speeding and provide turning for emergency and service vehicles. 



 
Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 2 
 
 
c. Existing cul-de-sac streets may be extended beyond 750 feet in length when necessary to accommodate new platting or redevelopment, provided the following requirements are met:  1) there is no other street access alternative, 2) the cul-de-sac is extended the minimum length necessary to provide for reasonable use of the land, 3) fire flows meet City requirements and looping of the water system will be provided or is planned for, 4) there is a secondary access unless waived by the Council and 5) the street design incorporates features such as curves, signage and/or additional turnarounds sufficient to minimize traffic backtracking, limit speeding and provide turning for emergency and service vehicles. 



 
G. Street Grades.  The minimum grade for all streets shall be 0.75%.  Grades within 30 feet of intersections with arterial and collector streets and grades for the turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed three percent.  Otherwise, the maximum grades shall be as follows: 
 
Street Type 
 Maximum Grade 
 
Minor Arterial 
 5% 
 
Collector 
 6% 
 
Local 
 7% 
 

 
(Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 
 
H. Intersections. 
 
1. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right (90 degree) angles with a 50 foot minimum tangent from the radius return.  The angle of an intersection may be varied in cases where topography or other factors justify a variation, but in no case shall a street intersect with another street at angle of less than 75 degrees.  Intersections having more than four corners shall be prohibited. 


 
2. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street.  Street jogs shall have a centerline offset of at 


 
least 125 feet for local streets and 150 feet for minor arterial and major and minor collector streets. 
 
3. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. 


Plymouth City Code       524.05, Subd. 2 
 
 
G. Street Alignment. 


 
1. Deflections (horizontal alignment).  When connecting street lines of the same street deflect from each other at any one point by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet for local streets, and of such greater distance as necessary to meet the Minnesota Department of Transportation Road Design Manual, latest revision, for minor arterial and collector streets.  The City Council may require greater or lesser sight distances at the recommendation of the City Engineer. 


 
2. Reverse Curves (horizontal alignment).  A tangent of at least 50 feet shall be provided between reverse curves on local streets, and of at least 100 feet on minor arterial and collector streets. 


 
3. Differing Street Gradients (vertical alignment).  Differing connecting street gradients for minor arterial and collector streets shall be connected with vertical parabolic curves.  The minimum length of such curves shall be in accordance with the Minnesota Department of Transportation Road Design Manual, latest revision. 


 
Subd. 3. Street Dedication and Reservations. 
 
A. All streets within a subdivision shall be dedicated as public streets on the plat. 


 
B. Streets in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets.  Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider.  The City Council may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within the subdivision boundaries. 


 
C. Where a subdivision borders an existing substandard street or street needing improvement, the subdivider shall be required to improve and dedicate at its expense those areas for widening or improvement.  Such streets shall be improved and dedicated to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations when the subdivider’s activities contribute to the need for the street expansion.   


 
524.07. Sidewalks and Trails. 
 
Subd. 1.  Required Improvements. 
A. A sidewalk or trail shall be installed along all arterial and collector roadways consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan.  A sidewalk shall be required on one side of all local streets unless specifically waived by the City 


Plymouth City Code       524.07, Subd. 1 
 
 
Council.  Sidewalks shall extend to the turn-around portion of a cul-de-sac street.  Construction of both sidewalks and trails shall be as specified in the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  (Ord. 2006-05, 2/07/2006; Ord. 2008-08, 3/24/2008) 
 
B. Width.  Sidewalks along local streets shall be a minimum of five feet wide.  Trails shall be a minimum of eight feet wide, unless located directly behind a curb, in which case they shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide. 


 
C. Grade.  Sidewalks and trails shall be sloped in such a manner so as to prevent pooling of storm water runoff and to drain away from any nearby buildings.  The profile grade shall not exceed the grade of the adjacent roadway, unless authorized by the City Engineer. 


 
Subd. 2.  Location.  Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated street right-of-way.  Trails may be located within the street right-of-way, an easement or an outlot, depending on whether there is sufficient right-of-way to accommodate the trail and meet other City requirements, including snow storage. 
 
524.09. Drainage and Water Quality. 
 
Subd. 1.  General Requirements. 
 
A. The Council will not approve any subdivision that does not make adequate provision for quantity and quality of storm water runoff.  Any storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system.   


 
B. The subdivider shall design storm sewers by the Rational Method, or other methods as approved by the Council, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with plans.  Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter.  When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow at that point.  Surface water drainage shall be shown for each and every lot and block. 


 
C. The subdivider shall demonstrate that the runoff generated by the proposed subdivision is properly treated on or off site for phosphorus and total suspended solid levels consistent with the requirements of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, including the Surface Water Management Plan and the Hydrologic and Hydraulic Study of the 2020 Urban Expansion Area.  (Ord. 2013-12, 4/23/2013) 


 
Plymouth City Code       524.09, Subd. 1 
 
 
D. New development that creates more than one acre, cumulatively, of impervious surface may not take place without water quality retention basins, ponds or devices for the development site.  Water quality basins shall be designed in accordance with the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 


 
E. If the City’s Comprehensive Plan designates a regional pond within the boundaries of the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall provide the City with easements for the regional pond.  The subdivider shall construct the pond in conjunction with development of the subdivision. 


 
Subd. 2.  Nature of Storm Water Facilities. 
 
A. Location.  The City may require the subdivider to carry away by pipe any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision.  Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in accordance the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 


 
B. Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas.  A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision.  The City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the facility, based on the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 


 
C. Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas.  The City’s Comprehensive Plan together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements in downstream drainage facilities outside the subdivision. 


 
1. The subdivider shall construct retention ponds or use natural basins or green corridors to limit runoff to pre-development rates and to control downstream flooding. 





 
2. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the City may withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the expansion of the existing downstream drainage facility. 
 
D. Floodplain Areas. 


 
Plymouth City Code       524.09, Subd. 2 
 
 
1. Encroachment into the floodplain and floodway below 100-year flood levels shall be prohibited without mitigating action that will preserve the storage capacity, prevent a surcharge in the flood profile and minimize excessive velocities.  The subdivider shall provide for an overflow zone along the bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width that shall be sufficient in times of high water to contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or placed in the overflow zone.  The boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer. 


 
2. The City may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present or future population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of a property that lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. 


 
Subd. 3.  Dedication of Drainage Easements. 
 
A. General Requirements.  Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park dedication, whichever the City may deem more appropriate.  This easement, right-of-way or dedication shall conform substantially with the lines of such water courses, together with such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the storm water drainage of the area.  The City Engineer shall determine the width of such easements, etc. 


 
B. Drainage Easements. 


 
1. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, the subdivider shall provide perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width for drainage facilities across property outside the road lines and with satisfactory access to the road.  Easements shall be indicated on the plat.  Drainage easements shall extend from the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
 
2. When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat. 
 
3. The subdivider shall dedicate by a drainage easement, land lying within a delineated wetland and required wetland buffer strip, and land on each side of the centerline of any body of water, watercourse or drainage channel, whether or not shown on the City’s Comprehensive Plan, to a sufficient width to 1) provide proper protection for water  
Plymouth City Code       524.09, Subd. 3 
 
 
quality, 2) provide retention of storm water runoff and 3) provide for the installation and maintenance of storm sewers.  (Ord. 2016-12, 4/26/2016) 
 
524.11. Sewer and Water Facilities. 
 
Subd. 1.  General Requirements. 
 
A. The subdivider shall install adequate sewer and water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the specifications in the City’s Engineering Guidelines/Standard Detail Specifications.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 


 
B. The subdivider shall install sewer and water mains and service connections, which are stubbed to the property line, to serve all lots in the subdivision.  The Council, in its discretion, may waive this requirement upon a showing that to require the installation of sewer and/or water mains within the subdivision would not be feasible with regard to the extension of existing trunk mains to service the subdivision or that particular locations or unusual circumstances of the proposed plat would cause undue hardship to either the owner or subdivider or the City. 


 
 C. The subdivider shall extend sewer and water lines to the lot lines of abutting sites that do not have public water service. 
 
524.13. Other Utilities. 
 
Subd. 1.  Location.  All utility facilities, including but not limited to telephone, CATV, natural gas and electric power, shall be located underground.  Such utilities shall be placed within a joint trench unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.  Whenever existing utility facilities are located above ground, except when existing on public roads and right-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground.  Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense.  At the discretion of the City, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to be developed for the same primary use.  (Ord. 2013-12, 4/23/2013) 
 
Subd. 2.  Easements.  Utility easements shall be required within the perimeter of each lot, measured from the lot lines.  Such easements shall be at least 10 feet wide adjacent to right-of-way and at least six feet wide adjacent to other land.  Such easements shall have continuity for alignment from block to block.  Such easements shall also be provided at deflection points for pole-line anchors where necessary. 
 
Subd. 3.  Dedication.  Easements shall be dedicated on the plat instrument for the required use. 
 
(Ord. 2003-15, 6/10/2003) 


Plymouth City Code        526.01 
 
 
Section 526 – Erosion Control 
 
 
526.01. Erosion Control Plan.  Prior to commencing any earth disturbing activity in a subdivision, the subdivider shall submit an erosion control plan for approval by the City Engineer.  The plan shall be approved if it complies with the City's Zoning Ordinance and the requirements contained herein. 
 
526.03. Erosion Control Measures. 
 
 Subd. 1.  The following erosion control measures are required for an erosion control plan: 
 
 A. The plan shall be suited to the topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential. 
 
 B. The land shall be developed in increments of workable size on which adequate controls of erosion and siltation can be provided and maintained during the construction period.  Grading operations and other land disturbing operations shall be staged so that the area being developed is not exposed for long periods of time without stabilization. 
 
 C. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect the areas exposed during the development.  No area shall be left denuded for a period longer than 14 days after initial site grading and other land disturbing operations.  An erosion control blanket is required on slopes that are 3:1 or steeper.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008; Ord. 2011-29, 10/25/2011; Ord. 2012-06, 2/28/2012) 
 
 D. Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed within 30 days after completion of initial grading.  If grading is not completed until after the planting season has expired, temporary erosion control measures, including dormant seeding and mulching, shall be implemented. 
 
 E. Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from the land undergoing development.  Storm sewer inlets shall be provided with debris guards and microsilt basins to trap sediment and avoid possible damage from blockage.  The silt shall be removed when necessary.  If sediment/siltation measures taken are not adequate and result in downstream sediment, the subdivider shall be responsible for cleaning out or dredging downstream storm sewers and ponds as necessary. 
 
 F. Before grading is commenced, all control measures as shown on the approved plan shall be installed. 
 
 G. Immediately after curb and gutter has been placed, cured and backfilled, City approved erosion control measures shall be installed directly behind the curb.   
Plymouth City Code        526.03, Subd. 1 
 
 
This requirement does not alter the subdivider's responsibility for sodding the boulevard. 
 
 H. Erosion control practices shall comply with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s General Permit to Discharge Stormwater Associated with Construction Activity No. MN-R100001, the Minnesota Stormwater Manual, or other practices as approved by the City Engineer.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008; Ord. 2011-29, 10/25/2011; Ord. 2015-10, 3/24/2105) 
 
 I. The subdivider shall be responsible for cleaning and maintenance of the storm sewer system [including ponds, pipes, catch basins, culverts, and swales] within the subdivision and the adjacent off-site storm sewer system that receives storm water from the subdivision.  The subdivider shall follow all instructions it receives from the City concerning the cleaning and maintenance of the storm sewer system.  The subdivider's obligations under this paragraph shall end after the erosion control is complete and financial guarantees have been released. 
 
 J. The subdivider shall be responsible for cleaning all streets in the subdivision and adjacent to the subdivision from silt and dirt from the subdivision. 
 
 Subd. 2.  Financial Guarantee: 
 
 A. In order to guarantee compliance with erosion control measures, a financial guarantee in the form of a non-interest bearing cash escrow or letter of credit satisfactory to the City in the amount of $1,500 per acre shall be provided to the City before work is commenced.  Up to $2,000 of this amount shall be by cash deposit to be held by the City of Plymouth in a non-interest bearing account.  The financial guarantee shall remain in place until all the subdivider's obligations under the erosion control plan have been satisfied.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008)  
 
B. If the City draws upon the financial guarantee, the subdivider shall within 10 days of the draw, deposit with the City additional security of the same type and amount that the City has drawn.  No further inspections will be conducted, no new building permits will be issued, and all work shall stop within the development until the cash deposit for erosion control is restored to the pre-draw balance. 
 
 Subd. 3.  Street Cleaning.  Prior to commencement of grading, the subdivider shall enter into a contract with an unrelated third party to scrape and sweep the streets in the subdivision and on abutting streets from soil and silt deposited on the streets.  At a minimum, scraping and sweeping shall take place on a weekly basis.  The City shall be furnished a copy of the contract.  The contract shall further provide that the City may order cleaning of the streets and that the subdivider shall pay the cost.  If the subdivider fails to do so, the City may draw on the subdivider's financial guarantee with the City and use it to provide payment for the cleaning. 
 
Plymouth City Code        526.03, Subd. 4 
 
 
 Subd. 4.  Enforcement: 
 
 A. The City may issue a stop work order halting all development work and building construction for noncompliance with the erosion control plan. 
 
 B. The City may draw down the posted financial guarantee and perform any work necessary to achieve compliance with the erosion control plan.  The City will endeavor to give the subdivider advance notice of such action. 
 
 C. The subdivider shall pay to the City an administration fee of $500 for each violation of the erosion control plan.  If the subdivider does not promptly pay the fee, the City may draw upon the posted financial guarantee to pay it.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008)

Plymouth City Code        528.01 
 
 
Section 528 – Park Dedication 
 
 
528.01. Purpose and Findings. 
 
 Subd. 1.  Minnesota Statutes Section 462.358, Subd. 2b provides that municipal subdivision regulations may require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use as parks, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space, and that the municipality may alternatively accept an equivalent amount in cash. 
 
 
 Subd. 2.  The Council finds that: 
 
A. The preservation and development of parks, playgrounds, and open space areas within the City are essential to maintaining a healthy and desirable environment for residents and persons employed within the City.  Further, the value and attractiveness of residential and commercial/industrial developments to landowners, developers, purchasers, employers, and employees is significantly enhanced by the presence of such parks and open space amenities. 
 
B. New developments place a burden upon the City’s parks and open space system.  New facilities must be developed concurrently with development in order to maintain the current level of service and the quality of the environment for all. Therefore, new developments shall be required to contribute toward the City’s park system in rough proportion to the relative burden they will place upon the park system, in order to maintain the existing level of service to the community. 
 
 C. Residential development of land creates approximately 90% of the need for park and recreational land and facilities within the City. 
 
D. Commercial/industrial development of land creates approximately 10% of the need for park and recreational land and facilities within the City. 
 
E. Development of land for schools creates additional demand on the City’s park and recreational land and facilities, to the extent that the school serves students who do not live within the City.   
 
528.03. Dedication Required. 
 
Subd. 1.  At the time of subdivision, the developer shall dedicate land for public use as parks, playgrounds, recreation facilities, trails, or public open space, in an amount equal to the development’s proportional share of the City park system, as determined by this chapter. Any land dedicated shall be in a location and of a character consistent with and suitable for meeting the needs identified by the City’s Comprehensive Plan. Generally, land located within flood 
Plymouth City Code        528.03, Subd. 1 
 
 
plains or wetlands shall not be accepted to meet the proportional share of required land dedication.  The City may consider accepting ownership of these lands without giving credit for park dedication.   
 
Subd. 2.  If the Council determines that land is not needed in the area of the proposed subdivision, the City may alternatively require payment of an equivalent amount in cash.  Any such cash payment shall be used for the acquisition and improvement of land for parks, playgrounds, trails, or public open space, or as otherwise provided by statute.  The cash fee payment in lieu of land dedication is set by Chapter X.  (Ord. 2007-03, 1/23/2007; Ord. 2004-33, 12/14/2004; Ord. 2005-36, 11/29/2005; Ord. 2006-19, 6/27/2006; Ord. 2007-03, 1/23/2007, Ord. 2007-06, 2/13/2007) 
 
Subd. 3.  If the Council determines that land is needed in the development, but in a lesser amount than the required proportionate share, the Council may require payment of cash in lieu of land dedication based on a pro-rata share of the land dedication that otherwise would be required.   
 
Subd. 4.  The dedication requirements based on the development’s proportional share of the City park system are presumptively appropriate.  A developer may request a deviation from the presumptive requirements based upon the anticipated impact of that particular subdivision.  The request must be made to the Council as part of an application for final plat approval.   
 
528.05. Calculation of Proportional Share. 
 
Subd. 1.  Residential Development.  A residential development’s proportional share is the per capita residential share multiplied by the number of residents expected in the development.  
 
Subd. 2.  Commercial/Industrial Development.  A commercial or industrial development’s proportional share is the per capita commercial/industrial share multiplied by the number of employees expected in the development.  
 
Subd. 3.  Schools.  A school’s proportional share is the per capita residential share multiplied by the number of students expected to attend the school who live outside of the City.   
 
528.07. Land Dedication/Payment of Fees.  Dedication of land and/or payment of park dedication fees shall be as follows: 
 
Subd. 1.  Land Dedication.  When land is to be dedicated to satisfy the park dedication requirement, separate lots or outlots shall be indicated on the plat drawings for the area(s) to be dedicated.  Such lots or outlots shall be deeded to the City prior to the issuance of any building permits within the plat.  The developer shall be responsible for finished grading and ground cover and construction of trails in all lands to be dedicated to the City.  No credit toward the required dedication shall be given for this work, except that credit for the cost of improvements to trails included in the City’s adopted trail plan may be given.   
Plymouth City Code        528.07, Subd. 2 
 
 
Subd. 2.  Cash Fee.  When a cash fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the payment of such fee shall be required as follows: 
 
A. For residential developments, the fee shall be paid prior to the City’s release of the signed final plat mylars for recording with Hennepin County.  The exception is that in the case of multiple-family residential developments where the site plan review occurs after the time of final plat approval, the fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of any building permits. 
 
 B. For commercial and industrial developments and schools, the fee shall be paid prior to issuance of any building permits within the subdivision.  A pro-rated portion of the fee may be deferred if the subdivider proposes to construct significantly less square footage than the site supports, provided that any remaining fees shall be paid if and when additional square footage is constructed on the site in the future. 
 
C. In plats that include outlots for future development, the subdivider may pay to the City 1) the development’s proportional share for the entire subdivision including the outlots, or 2) the development’s proportional share excluding such outlots, provided that the park dedication requirement shall be satisfied when such outlots are replatted.

Plymouth City Code       530.01 
 
 
Section 530 – Tree Preservation 
 
 
530.01. Findings and Purposes. 
 
 Subd. 1.  The Council recognizes that preservation and replanting of trees is important on new development sites in order to maintain a healthy and desirable community.  The Council also recognizes that a certain amount of tree loss is an inevitable consequence of the urban development process.  The Council finds that these tree preservation regulations help to establish a balance between an individual’s rights to develop his or her property, and the needs of the community to protect all aspects of the natural environment and to provide housing, services, and employment opportunities within the City. 
 
 Subd. 2.  The purposes of these tree preservation regulations include, but are not limited to, 1) prevention of soil erosion and sedimentation, 2) improved air quality, 3) reduced noise pollution, 4) energy conservation through natural insulation and shading, 5) control of the urban heat island effect, 6) increased property values, 7) protection of privacy by maintaining and establishing buffers between conflicting land uses, and 8) providing habitat for wildlife. 
 
530.03. Scope.  The regulations contained in this section shall apply to all properties involving 1) a preliminary plat application received after August 15, 1995, or 2) a lot division application resulting in the creation of one or more new development parcels, received after August 15, 1995.  The City does, however, strongly encourage preservation of healthy trees on all properties within the City.  (Ord. 2009-08, 5/12/2009) 
 
530.05. Removal Threshold. 
 
Subd. 1.  Developments in residential districts may remove or disturb up to 50% of the total inches of significant trees.  Any removal or disturbance beyond this threshold shall require reforestation or restitution. 
 
Subd. 2.  Developments in non-residential districts may remove or disturb up to 75% of the total inches of significant trees.  Any removal or disturbance beyond this threshold shall require reforestation or restitution. 
 
Subd. 3.  For developments in mixed use districts that include both residential and non-residential uses, the developer of any lot that solely contains residential use may remove or disturb up to 50% of the total inches of significant trees on such lot.  The developer may remove or disturb up to 75% of the significant trees on the remainder of the site.  Any removal or disturbance beyond these thresholds shall require reforestation or restitution.  (Ord. 2012-06, 2/28/2012) 
 
530.07. Reforestation/Restitution Requirement.  If a development exceeds the allowable removal or disturbance threshold specified in Section 530.05 above, the subdivider shall either reforest appropriate areas within the site (or outside the site if appropriate locations within the  
Plymouth City Code        530.07 
 
 
site are not available) or pay restitution, or provide a combination thereof, as directed by the City.  For each one (1.0) tree inch that is removed or disturbed beyond the threshold, the subdivider shall replant 1.25 inches of new trees or provide the City with $125 in restitution.  (Ord. 2006-05, 2/07/2006; Ord. 2013-12, 4/23/2013) 
 
530.09. Tree Inches Not Counted.  The tree inches of significant trees to be removed for water quality treatment ponds, public trails or sidewalks, and rights-of-way for arterial and major collector roadways shall be exempt from the calculation of total significant tree inches on a development site. 
 
530.11. Tree Survey/Preservation Plan.  A tree survey and tree preservation plan shall be submitted with all preliminary plat applications, and with all lot division applications involving the creation of one or more new development parcels.  The tree survey and tree preservation plan shall be prepared and signed by a registered surveyor or forester not less than two years prior to submission of a complete application for preliminary plat approval, and shall provide the following information: 
 
A. Location, diameter, and species of all significant trees on the site. 
 
B. Identification of which significant trees are 1) to be protected, preserved, or undisturbed, 2) to be removed or disturbed, and 3) exempt from the calculation (under Section 530.09).  (Ord. 2006-05, 2/07/2006) 
 
C. Areas proposed to be designated as natural preserves where all natural vegetation, including significant trees, will be protected and preserved (refer to Section 811 of the City Code-- Natural Preserves—for information requirements). 
 
D. Proposed disturbance zones, as identified by cross-hatching or gray-colored shading on the plan. 
 
E. Location and dimensions of building pads, construction zone for each lot, and proposed street layout and grading contours of the site. 
 
F. Proposed locations and details of tree protection fencing to be installed for all trees to be preserved. 
 
G. Calculation of removed or disturbed significant tree inches on the site (excluding exempt tree inches) divided by the total significant tree inches on the site (excluding exempt tree inches). 
 
530.13. Reforestation/Restitution Plan. 
 
Subd. 1.  If the amount of significant tree inches to be removed or disturbed exceeds the specified threshold, the subdivider shall provide a reforestation plan, or a calculation of restitution, or a combination thereof. 
 
Plymouth City Code       530.13, Subd. 2 
 
 
Subd. 2.  A reforestation plan shall be prepared and signed by a registered landscape architect or forester and shall comply with the following criteria: 
 
A. The plan shall indicate the location and diameter or height of all trees to be planted. 
 
B. No more than 1/4 of the trees to be planted may be from any one species, unless recommended by the City Forester. 
 
C. Plantings shall be of similar vegetation as found on the site, with a preference for plantings designated as native to the site. 
 
D. The minimum planting size for deciduous trees shall be 2.5 inches in diameter, and the minimum planting size for coniferous trees shall be six feet in height, except that up to 15% of the required tree inches may be of ornamental species of a lesser size, provided the required number of replacement inches is maintained. 
 
E. Installation of trees shall follow the City’s standard tree planting details as provided in the City’s Engineering Guidelines.  (Ord. 2010-02, 2/23/2010) 
 
F. Trees to be planted shall be from certified nursery stock as defined and controlled by Minnesota Statutes Sections 18.44 through 18.61, the Plant Pest Act. 
 
Subd. 3.  Replacement trees shown on a reforestation plan may count toward the trees required by the City’s landscaping regulations. 
 
Subd. 4.  Restitution shall be paid to the City in cash prior to the City’s release of the signed final plat mylars for recording, or prior to approval of a minor subdivision.  Any restitution paid shall be placed in the Community Planting Fund and shall be used for reforestation projects in the City.

The guarantee shall be part of the development contract for projects including public improvements, or shall be part of a site improvement performance agreement (SIPA) if no public improvements are proposed. 
 
Subd. 2.  The amount of the financial guarantee shall be calculated as follows:  25% of the total significant tree inches shown as preserved that are located within 15 feet of a disturbance zone multiplied by $125 per inch, plus 100% of the total tree inches required by the reforestation plan, if applicable, multiplied by $125 per inch.  The minimum financial guarantee shall be $1,000.  The amount of the financial guarantee shall be maintained at the calculated level until such time as 1) all trees on the site (preserved trees and new reforestation trees) have survived a winter season, which is defined as the period 31 October through 30 April for the purpose of this section, and 2) the City has inspected the site and authorized a reduction or release. 
 
530.23. Inspection and Enforcement of Tree Preservation Plan. 
 
Subd. 1.  Prior to removal of any trees and prior to issuance of a grading permit, or prior to commencement of any grading operations if no grading permit is required, or prior to issuance of a building permit if no grading operations are required, all sites shall be staked and fenced for tree preservation pursuant to the approved tree preservation plan.  A copy of the approved tree preservation plan shall be submitted with an application for a grading permit, or with an application for a building permit if no grading permit is required.  Such tree preservation plan shall also indicate any reforestation trees to be planted on the site.  Upon staking of the site and installation of the tree protection fencing, but prior to issuance of any permits or commencement of any grading operations, the subdivider shall contact the City Forester to schedule an inspection of the staking and fence installation on the site.

Section 532 – Official Maps 
 
 
532.01. Purpose.  Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to non-public uses which could have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the owners.  When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of the land.  Identification on an official map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish.  It is the purpose of this ordinance to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official maps as authorized by the Minnesota Municipal Planning Act, Minnesota Statutes, Section 462.351 to 462.36. 
 
532.03. Official Map Defined.  “Official map” as used in this ordinance means a map adopted in accordance with this ordinance showing existing streets, proposed future streets, and the area needed for widening of existing streets of the City.  An official map may also show the location of existing and future land and facilities within the City.  An official map may cover the entire City or any portion of the City. 
 
532.05. Initiation of Proceedings.  Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated by 1) the City’s Planning Division; 2) a recommendation of the Planning Commission; or 3) action by the Council.  
 
532.07. Reference to Planning Commission.  Every proposed official map or change in a map shall be referred to the Planning Commission for advice and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the Council within 45 days after reference to the Planning Commission along with the report of the Commission on the effect of the proposal on the comprehensive plan of the City.  If no recommendation is received by the Council from the Planning Commission within 45 days after reference of the proposal to the Commission by the Council, the Council may take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal without further action by the Planning Commission. 
 
532.09. Notice and Hearing. 
 
Subd. 1.  Notice.  Upon receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission or after 45 days from the submission of the proposal to the Planning Commission without a recommendation from the Commission, the Council may call a public hearing on the proposal.  A notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the mapped streets and public grounds shall be published in the official newspaper at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing.  At least 10 days prior to the hearing the City Clerk shall also mail a copy of the notice to each owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public ground shown on the official map.  For purposes of this notice the owners shall be determined by the records of the County Auditor and the notice shall be addressed to the last known address as shown by the Auditor’s records.  Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings. 
Plymouth City Code       532.09, Subd. 2 
 
 
Subd. 2.  Hearing.  At the time and place specified in the notice, the Council shall hear evidence and arguments concerning the proposal.  The hearing may be continued from time to time without further notice.  The Council may direct the Planning Commission to conduct a hearing and following the hearing to report its recommendation to the Council. 
 
532.11  Preparation and Filing of Maps.  The official map or maps shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future acquisition lines on the ground.  In unplatted areas a minimum of a centerline survey shall be made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map.  The accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on the official map shall be attested to by a licensed land surveyor.  After enactment of any ordinance adopting an official map or amending or repealing a previous official map ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to which the ordinance relates together with an attached copy of the ordinance shall be filed with the County Recorder.  
 
532.13. Effect.  After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits by the City shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance.  The City shall deny every application for a permit to construct a new building or structure or expand an existing building or structure within any area designated on the official map for street or other public purposes.  Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or any interest in lands for other public purposes is acquired by the City, the City is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the existing street or within any area thus identified for public purposes.  The adoption of an official map does not give the City any right, title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the City to acquire such interest without paying compensation for buildings or structures erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit. 
 
532.15. Appeals.  Whenever a building permit is denied pursuant to this ordinance, the Board of Appeals and Adjustments shall, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land, grant a permit for building in an area designated on the official map for a street or other public purpose in any case in which the Board of Appeals and Adjustments finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it, (a) that the entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for public purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such a permit is granted, or (b) that balancing the interest of the City in preserving the integrity of the official map and of the comprehensive City plan and the interest of the property owner in the use of his property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by considerations of justice and equity.  The Board of Appeals and Adjustments shall hold a public hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the official newspaper once at least 10 days before the hearing.  If the Board of Appeals and Adjustments authorizes the issuance of a permit, it shall specify the exact location, ground area, height, and other details as to the extent and character of the building for which the permit is granted.  If the Board of Appeals and Adjustments authorizes issuance of a permit, the Council or other Board or Commission having jurisdiction shall have six months from the date of the decision of the Board of Appeals and Adjustments to institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and  
Plymouth City Code       532.15 
 
 
if no such proceedings are started within that time, the City shall issue the permit if the application otherwise conforms to local ordinances.

 Subd. 2.  Type 1; Vitrified Clay Wye Branches Installed in the Main Sewer at the Time of Construction.  Connections to existing wye branches shall be made with an approved type of joint material of the bituminous type or an approved compression coupling.  The connection shall be completely watertight.  No connection shall be allowed to any damaged wye branch.  If damage occurs during the making of the connection, the wye branch shall be taken out of the main sewer by the plumber and replaced either by another undamaged wye or by straight vitrified clay pipe.  If straight pipe is used in the replacement, other approved connection methods shall be used.  Concrete encasement of the wye branch, connection joint, or any other part of the connection shall not be deemed watertight and shall not be allowed as a method of repairing a damaged joint.  House service connections may be made with any material authorized by the Building Code.  Such pipe must be connected to the building drain at its point of exit from the building unless heavy duty cast iron pipe is already in use from the building to 
the septic tank or cesspool, in which case the connection may be made at the septic tank or cesspool.  When a service connection is placed across peat or other unstable soil having a depth in excess of four feet, bridging using four foot lengths of 2" x 6" planks should be placed three feet on center under the service pipe.  In the event that the peat or other unstable soil is four feet or less in depth, then such peat or other unstable soil must be removed and a stabilized base be placed to the pipe invert. 
 
 Subd. 3.  Type 2; Connections of the Saddle Type Installed in the Main Sewer.  Connection of this type shall be made in a smooth 3 round hole, machine-drilled into the main sewer pipe.  The fitting used in the connection shall be made in such a manner as to insure that no protrusion of the fitting into the main sewer pipe shall result.  The connector shall fit perfectly the contour of the inside of the Sanitary Sewer and shall be specifically designed to fit the particular size main sewer pipe into which the connection is made.  The machine-drilled hole shall be of such size to provide 1/8 inch clearance between the outside of the fitting and the hole.  The space thus provided shall be completely filled with joint material.  The space between the shoulder of the fitting and the face of the main sewer pipe shall be 1/8 inch thick and this space shall also be completely filled with joint material.  The joint material used for the Type 2 house service connection shall be completely waterproof and shall be capable of withstanding any condition of stress or strain likely to be encountered in normal Sanitary Sewer construction or maintenance.  Concrete encasement will not be considered waterproof.  The fitting shall be manufactured of either cast aluminum alloy or vitrified clay pipe and shall be  
Plymouth City Code        705.27, Subd. 3 
 
 
capable of receiving all normally used types of pipe for house service connections.  The Type 2 fitting and drilling machine herein described shall be of the type manufactured by Smith & Loveless, Division - Union Tank Car Company, Lenexa, Kansas, or an approved equal. 
 
 Subd. 4.  Alternate Use of Type 1 and Type 2 Connections.  Type 1 connections may be used in existing Sanitary Sewers when wye branches previously installed are readily and conveniently available.  If existing wye branches cannot be found readily and are not located properly for providing the needed service, Type 2 connections shall be made.  When new Sanitary Sewers are constructed, Type 1 connections may be made in cases where the connection to the house is made during construction and before backfilling of the sanitary main sewer trench.  No new branches shall be installed and covered up for future use.  Type 2 connections shall be made in all cases where house services are installed subsequent to construction and backfilling operations. 
 
705.29. Certain Uses of Sewers Prohibited.   It is unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged to any Public Sewer, any harmful waters of wastes, whether liquid, solid or gas, capable of causing obstruction to the flow in the sewers, damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the sewerage works, or other interferences with the proper operation of the sewage works.  Violation of this Subsection is a misdemeanor. 
(Ord. 95-36, 6/20/95) 
 
705.31. Approval Required for Admission in Sewers of Harmful or Objectionable Materials.  The admission into the Public Sewers of any waters or wastes having harmful or objectionable characteristics shall be subject to the review and approval of the Building Official, who may prescribe limits on the strength and character of these waters and wastes.  Where necessary, in the opinion of the Inspector, the owner shall provide at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to treat these wastes prior to discharge to the Public Sewer.  Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the said inspector and of the state board of health and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approval is obtained in writing.  Preliminary treatment facilities provided for any waters or wastes, shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
 
705.33. Control Manholes; When Required; Use.  When required by the Building Official, the owner of any property served by a Building Sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install and maintain at his expense a suitable control manhole in the Building Sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes.  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and sewage approved by the Minnesota Department of Health, and shall be determined at the control manhole or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole.  In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the Public Sewer to the point at which the Building Sewer is connected.

720.39. Water Connection Charges. 
 
Connection Charge. Residential Equivalent Connection (REC) charges are established by the City to finance central system costs, representing trunk water mains, reservoirs, wells, pumping stations, treatment facilities, and similar improvements. 
 
Plymouth City Code        720.39 
 
 
A. Before connecting to the City water system, City water connection charges based upon the number of units shall be paid.  If, after the initial connection charges are paid, additional building permits or new water connections are made, or when an increase of waste water flow into the municipal sanitary system is determined by the Metropolitan Council, and the water source is from the City system, charges shall be recalculated and any additional charges shall be paid.  The City connection charges per unit are set forth in section 1015 of the City Code. 
 
B. The number of REC units shall be computed as follows: 
 
1. All residential properties shall be assigned one unit per dwelling unit. 
 
2. Reductions. 
 
a. Apartments and condominiums (four or more units) shall be computed as 80% of a unit if there is no plumbing for laundry facilities within each dwelling unit. 
 
b. Multi-dwelling public housing units (four or more units), or publicly subsidized low income units under any government program shall be computed as 75% of a unit equivalent for that type of housing if there is no garbage disposal and dishwasher.  An additional 20% reduction applies if there is no plumbing for laundry facilities in each unit.  
 
3 Other buildings and structures shall be assigned one water unit as being equivalent to 72,000 gallons of sewage flow per year.  The most recent “Standard Criteria” published by the Metropolitan Council will be used to determine the number of REC units for various public, commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. 
 
C. The City connection charges shall be paid to the City before a building permit or water connection permit is issued.  The Council may assess the City connection charges on any dwelling or building when the installation of the City utility system is made after the construction of the dwelling or building.  The rate of interest shall be set by the Council. 
 
D. City water connection charges shall be deposited in the Water Utility Trunk System Expansion Fund.

The City Manager may adjust the REF for these parcels of land (by up to 75 percent) based upon the demonstration of run-off volumes substantially different from the standards used by the City.  Land use data, sufficient to determine storm water runoff, must be supplied by the property owner(s) to demonstrate that a fee adjustment is warranted.  Fee adjustments shall not be made retroactively.  Appeals of the City Manager’s determinations shall be made to the Council. 
 
725.07. Appeals –Other Properties.  The City Manager may adjust the REF for all parcels of land which are not single-family or duplex properties (by up to 75 percent) based upon the demonstration of run-off volumes substantially different from the standards used by the City.  The area of parcels may also be reduced by the area of qualifying NURP ponds at normal water level.   Land use data, sufficient to determine storm water runoff, must be supplied by the property owner(s) to demonstrate that a fee adjustment is warranted.  Fee adjustments shall not be made retroactively.  Appeals of the City Manager’s determinations shall be made to the Council. 
Plymouth City Code        725.08

The Council of the City believes it to be desirable and in the public interest to assure the orderly development of the City and provide for the safety and convenience of its inhabitants.  To this end the Council believes that all existing overhead distribution system and transmission lines of electrical and communication utilities, excluding high voltage transmission lines of 15,000 volts or more, be eliminated wherever possible, and that distribution lines and systems used in the supplying of electricity as well as communication or similar association services be placed, constructed and installed underground. 
 
735.03. Underground Utilities System Defined.  "Underground Utilities Systems" shall include, but not be limited to, electric, communications, street lighting and cable television lines.  The appurtenances and associated equipment of said systems such as, but not limited to surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts in an underground system shall not be included in said definition and may be properly placed upon or above the ground, and that high voltage transmission lines of 15,000 volts or more shall not be included in this definition and may be placed above ground. 
 
735.05. Underground Electric and Communication Distribution Systems.  Subdivision 1.  Requirements.  In addition to any other requirement of the City Code, the provisions of this Subsection shall be applicable to the installation of electric and communication distribution systems of all utilities, excluding high voltage circuits and transmission lines of 15,000 volts or more. 
 
 Subd. 2.  Extensions.  Every permanent extension of any distribution lines, circuits and systems and any service lateral providing permanent electric power service; communication service or other associated utility services shall be installed underground when for: 
 
  A. Any new installation of buildings, signs, street lights or other structures where the service lateral is street fed; 
 
  B. Any new subdivision; 
 
  C. Any new development or industrial park containing new commercial or industrial buildings; 
 
 Subd. 3.  Replacements.  Any permanent replacement, relocation or reconstruction of any distribution line, circuit or system of any such utility and any service lateral shall be installed underground in those instances where the new line, circuit or system is more than 1,000 feet, when for or made in connection with street paving, street widening, public utility installation and other such projects.  Such requirements may be waived by the Council after a report from the City Engineer that undergrounding is not required for one or more of the following reasons: 
 
Plymouth City Code       735.05, Subd. 3 
 
 
  A. The placing of utilities underground would not be compatible with the existing or planned development; 
 
  B. The additional cost of burying such utilities would create an undue financial hardship; or 
 
  C. Topographical, soil or any other conditions make the underground installation unreasonable or impractical. 
 
 Subd. 4.  Effect on Existing Utility.  Whenever any part or portion of the distribution system of any such utility in an area or district of the City is now located underground, such part or portion shall remain underground and any replacement, relocation, reconstruction, repair and extension thereof shall be installed underground. 
 
735.07. High Voltage Circuits/Transmission Lines.  All high voltage circuits and transmission lines of 15,000 volts or more which are constructed in the City after obtaining approval of the City Engineer, if not feasible to be placed underground, shall be placed whenever possible on two-legged or single-pole structures of metal or wood unless the City Engineer approves of other structural techniques. 
 
735.09. Exception, Emergency or Unusual Circumstances.  Notwithstanding the provision of this Section, the City Engineer may grant special permission on such terms as he may deem appropriate in cases of emergency or other unusual circumstances, without discrimination as to any person or utility, to temporarily erect, construct, install, maintain, use or operate poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures for periods up to nine months.  Said permits may be renewed for additional six month periods upon good cause shown.  Upon a showing of unusual circumstances of permanent nature which cause extreme hardship, the Council may grant special permission to a person or utility to erect, construct, install, maintain, use or operate poles, overhead wires and associated structures within the City on a permanent basis. 
 
735.11.  Liability and Claims.  All persons and companies providing electrical distribution and communications services under this Ordinance shall at all times save the City harmless from all damages arising from all accidents, injuries or any damage whatsoever that may be caused to any person or property due to the installation or use of any underground wiring, conduit or cables installed pursuant to the terms of this Ordinance and upon a ten day notice from the City shall appear and defend all suits for damages against the City as a result of any such accident, injury or damage. 
 
735.13. Application for Underground Space.  Persons or companies making application for spaces for underground facilities shall present their application and location drawings to the City Engineer clearly indicating the type of Underground Utility System to be used, whether the system is to be a joint system to include electric supply and communications facilities, and specifying the proposed start and duration of the construction and the part of the street needed for construction.  When such system, plans and specifications have been approved by the City Engineer, applicants who are unable to show financial responsibility to the satisfaction of the City Engineer may be required to deposit with the City a sufficient sum to defray the cost of repaving that portion of the street used by them in case such paving is required. 
 
Plymouth City Code       735.15 
 
 
735.15. Issuance of Permit.  In accordance with Chapter VIII, the City Engineer shall then issue a permit for such applicant granting the right to enter upon such streets as may be necessary, designating that portion that such applicant may be permitted to use and the location of their underground facilities.  Any question arising regarding the amount of space to be allowed any applicant or the location of their underground facility shall be determined by the City Engineer, and where a disagreement arises with reference to the City Engineer's decision, the said decision may be appealed to the City Council for final determination. 
 
735.17. Installation of Underground Facilities.  Underground facilities shall be located in the designated space as approved by the City Engineer.  All excavations for the purpose of placing facilities underground shall be made in accordance with specifications as approved by the City Engineer.  Periodic inspections of excavations and back-filling procedures will be conducted by representatives of the City Engineer to ensure adherence and compliance to specifications.  The top of all duct and cable system structures shall be located at a sufficient depth in accordance with the National Electric Safety Code to protect the system from injury.  All utility companies shall keep current records and prints of all underground facilities they own and operate.  Such plats shall be available to all other utility companies and the City immediately upon request.  In the repair, addition or change of any underground facilities, no person or company shall be permitted to interfere with the underground facilities of any other person or company, except so far as shall be necessary to make such repairs, additions, or changes.  All such repairs, additions or changes shall be made in accordance with specifications approved by the City Engineer and the City Engineer shall be notified before work thereon is commenced.  Conditions requiring emergency street opening and for repair may be handled at the discretion of the City Engineer and in accordance with Chapter VIII.  All companies having underground facilities under provisions of this Ordinance shall begin such work at a time fixed by the City Engineer and shall proceed with the construction of the same following the time scheduling as ordered by the City Engineer. 
 
735.19. Street Lighting.  Where a new development, whether residential, commercial, or industrial, is established incorporating a street lighting system, that lighting system shall have underground wiring and the style approved by the City.  The electrical service for the street lighting system shall be supplied to the area underground as authorized by the City Engineer. 
 
735.21. Existing Poles, Wires.  Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed as prohibiting necessary repairs to any poles or wires properly in use within the City limits. 
 
735.23. Violations.  A person who violates the terms of this Section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  The continued violation of the provisions of this Section shall constitute a separate offense for each day that such violation shall continue.

Plymouth City Code        740.01 
 
 
Section 740 - Prohibiting Discharges 
into the Sanitary Sewer System 
 
 
740.01. Purpose.  The discharge of water from roof, surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other natural precipitation into the City sewerage system results in flooding and overloading of the sewerage system.  When this water is discharged into the sanitary sewer system it is treated at the sewage treatment plant.  This results in very large and needless expenditures.  The Council, therefore, finds it in the best interest of the City to prohibit such discharges. 
 
740.02. Discharge Prohibited.  Except as otherwise expressly authorized in this Section, no water from any roof, surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other natural precipitation shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system.  Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require, because of infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces, and the like, a sump pump discharge system shall have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided herein.  A permanent installation shall be one which provides for year round discharge capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building, or structure, or is connected to City storm sewer or discharge through the curb and gutter to the street.  It shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the path of discharge, and if connections for altering the path of discharge, and if connected to the City storm sewer line, include a check valve and an air gap located in a small diameter structure as shown in the City's standard plates. 
 
740.03. Disconnection.  Before August 1, 1995, any person, firm, or corporation having a roof surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, or swimming pool now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall disconnect or remove same.  Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary sewer system shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner. 
 
740.04. Inspection.  Every person owning improved real estate that discharges into the City's sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the City or a designated representative of the City to inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system.  In lieu of having the City inspect their property, any person may furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber certifying that their property is in compliance with this ordinance. 
 
740.05. Future Inspections.  Each sump pump connection identified will be reinspected periodically. 
 
740.06. New Construction.  All new dwellings with sumps for which a building permit is issued after August 1, 1995, shall have a pump and shall be piped to the outside of the dwelling before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
 
Plymouth City Code       740.07 
 
 
740.07. Surcharge.  A surcharge of $100 per month is hereby imposed on every sewer bill mailed on and after October 1, 1995, to property owners who are not in compliance with this ordinance or who have refused to allow their property to be inspected to determine if there is compliance.  All properties found during yearly reinspection to have violated this ordinance will be subject to the $100 per month penalty for all months between the two most recent inspections. 
 
740.08. Winter Discharge.  The City Manager is authorized to issue a permit to allow a property owner to discharge Surface Water into the sanitary sewer system.  The permit shall authorize such discharge only from November 15 to March 15 and a property owner is required to meet at least one of the following criteria in order to obtain the permit: 
 
  A. The freezing of the surface water discharge from the sump pump or footing drain is causing a dangerous condition, such as ice buildup or flooding, on either public or private property. 
 
  B. The property owner has demonstrated that there is a danger that the sump pump or footing drain pipes will freeze up and result in either failure or damage to the sump pump unit or the footing drain and cause basement flooding. 
 
  C. The water being discharged from the sump pump or footing drain cannot be readily discharged into a storm drain or other acceptable drainage system. 
 
Following 10 days written notice and an opportunity to be heard, the City Manager may require a property to discharge their sump pump into the sanitary sewer from November 15 to March 15 if surface water discharge is causing an icy condition on streets.

B. Restoration Costs.  The permittee shall restore the public right-of-way and assume all costs therefor unless otherwise agreed upon.  The right-of-way user shall remain responsible for replacing and compacting the sub-grade and aggregate base material in the excavation.  The City, at its option, may choose to perform its own restoration including any paving.  If the City performs the restoration pursuant to this paragraph, the permittee shall pay to the City all costs thereof within 30 days of billing.  If following such restoration, the roadway surface, boulevard, sidewalk, curb or related infrastructure settles due to permittee's improper back-filling compaction or; the permittee shall, at its option, either correct the defect or pay to the City all costs associated with correcting the defective work within 30 days of billing.  If the permittee restores the public right-of-way, the City may require, and the permittee shall provide at the time of application for the permit, a City specified type of security, in accordance with PUC rules, to cover the cost of repair and restoration.  If within 24 months after completion of restoration of the right-of-way, the Director determines the right-of-way has been properly restored, the posted security will be released.   
 
C. Standards.  All restoration shall be in accordance with the standards and  
Plymouth City Code       800.02, Subd. 12 
 
 
materials specified by the City.  The City shall maintain written procedures and standards for public right-of-way restoration, which shall comply with PUC standards.  Subject to PUC rules, the City shall have the authority to prescribe additional restoration procedures and standards on a case-by-case basis based on the following considerations: 
 
 1. The number, size, depth and duration of the excavation, disruption or damage to the public right-of-way; 
 
2. The traffic volume carried by the public right-of-way;  
 
3. The character of the neighborhood surrounding the public right-of-way; 
 
4. The pre-project condition of the public right-of-way;  
 
5. The remaining life expectancy of the public right-of-way due to the project;

To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the City or when necessary to protect the public right-of-way and its current use, the City may prohibit public right-of-way users from a particular right-of-way after consideration of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the public right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the public right-of-way, and future City plans for public improvements and development projects which  
 
D. Relocation and Temporary Relocation for Construction of Facilities.  A public right-of-way user shall promptly, and at its own expense, with due regard to seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate any facility in the public right-of-way when it is necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the City, in connection with: (1) a present or future City use of the public right-of-way for a public project; (2) the public health or safety; or (3) the safety and convenience of travel over the public right-of-way including temporary relocation for construction.  The public right-of-way user shall restore any public rights-of-way in accordance with this Section.  A right-of-way user is not required to remove or relocate its facilities from a right-of-way that has been vacated and in favor of a non-governmental entity unless and until  
Plymouth City Code       800.02, Subd. 16 
 
 
the reasonable costs to do so are first paid to the right-of-way user. 
 
 E. Damage to Other Facilities.  Public right-of-way users shall be subject to all restoration requirements provided in this Section.  Every public right-of-way user shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facility it damages.

Upon receipt of a completed application, the City Engineer will review the application and will consider factors such as the type and use of the existing easement(s), as well as the type and use of the proposed structure or obstruction, when making a decision to recommend approval or denial of the requested encroachment.  If an approval recommendation is made, the applicant will be required to sign an Encroachment Agreement, prepared by the City, before the City Engineer’s recommendation is forwarded to the Council for consideration.  If the Encroachment Agreement is approved by the Council, the Encroachment Agreement will be executed and recorded against the subject property of record. 
 
Subd. 17.  Public Right-of-Way Vacation. 
 
A. Reservation of Right.  If the City vacates a public right-of-way which contains the equipment or facilities of a public right-of-way user and the vacation does not require the relocation of the equipment or facilities, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and the public right-of-way user, the right to install, maintain and operate any equipment and facilities in the vacated public right-of-way and to enter upon such public right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstruction, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.

Section 803 – Small Wireless Facilities in the 
    Right-of-Way 
 
 
803.01. Purpose and Findings.  The City desires high quality wireless services to accommodate the needs of residents and businesses.  At the same time, the City strives to minimize the negative impacts that small wireless facilities can create.  These negative impacts include, but are not limited to, interference with right-of-way user sight lines, impacts to right-of-way user circulation, incompatible aesthetics with the surrounding area, fall zone risk, clear zone risk, creating navigation obstacles, interference with future travel way expansion plans, interference with the delivery of other utility services, interference with storm water management facilities, and increased noise pollution.  
 
To minimize these negative impacts, any person desiring to place a new wireless support structure in the right-of-way or collocate small wireless facilities on existing privately-owned wireless support structures in the right-of-way shall first obtain a small wireless facility permit from the City.  Any person desiring to collocate small wireless facilities on existing wireless support structures owned or controlled by the City shall first enter into a standard small wireless facility collocation agreement.  The purpose of these requirements is to comply with Minnesota Statutes Sections 237.162 and 237.163, while at the same time protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.  
 
The City will consider impacts to the public health, safety and welfare when reviewing a small wireless permit application and a request to enter into a small wireless facility collocation agreement.  The public health, safety and welfare can be best accommodated by locating small wireless facilities in the following order, which affords the greatest protection of the public:  
 
1. Locate outside of the right-of-way. 
2. Locate in the right-of-way on or adjacent to Principal Arterial, Other Arterial or Collector roads, as classified by the Metropolitan Council Functional Classification System. 
3. Collocate on existing wireless support structures within the right-of-way. 
4. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way that replaces an existing wireless support structure of the same height.  
5. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way that replaces an existing wireless support structure whose height is less than or equal to 50 feet. 
6. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way whose height is similar to nearby structures.  
7. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way whose height is less than or equal to 50 feet.  
 
The City will also consider factors such as aesthetic compatibility of the small wireless facility with surrounding structures, ability to eliminate underground, or screen ground-mounted equipment, dangers within the small wireless facility fall zone, distance of the small wireless  
Plymouth City Code         803.01

Section 811 – Natural Preserves 
 
 
811.01  Purpose and Intent.  It is the policy of the City to encourage preservation, including appropriate management, of natural areas within the community.  To this end, the City will formally recognize areas within Plymouth where the City and/or a private property owner find it is beneficial to maintain the area in a natural state. 
 
811.02. Definition of Natural Preserve.  Publicly owned lands designated as park or open space or private properties approved by the City which are set aside to preserve, enhance, or recreate their natural characteristics and qualities.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008) 
 
811.03. Procedures to Establish a Natural Preserve. 
 
 Subd. 1.  Designation without platting or site plan approval.  To request natural preserve designation, a property owner must submit a written application to the City.  Lands that the Council finds have merit as natural preserves will be so designated by Council resolution.  Ten days prior to Council action on a natural preserve, the City will mail notification of the pending action to all owners of property within 200 feet of the boundary of the property in question.  An application for natural preserve designation must include the following: 
 
A. Fee established by Section 1015 of this Code. 


 
B. A property survey that identifies the area to be designated.  Unless otherwise authorized by the Council as part of the approval process, a minimum of eight feet of maintained area (e.g. sodded or mulched) is mandatory between the proposed natural area and any lot line, building, parking lot or related drive aisle, or public roadway or trail.  


 
C. A description of the existing and/or proposed vegetation types in the area.  The vegetation in the area shall consist of native plant communities or native plantings, as approved by the City.  The City will not designate areas as natural preserves that consist of previously graded area with little or no topsoil, which is simply overgrown with whatever vegetation will grow on the site.  In addition, extreme slopes may be excluded from natural preserve designation due to inaccessibility or hardship in maintaining the slope.  


 
D. A management plan.  Lands designated as natural preserves shall be managed to ensure compliance with State Noxious Weed Laws.  The applicant shall enter into a maintenance agreement for the natural preserve.  The City may require financial surety for maintenance of the natural preserve. 


 
E. If the proposed natural preserve would, or is intended to, re-create natural areas on a site (e.g., replacement of sod with native landscaping), the areas for natural preserve shall not exceed 50 percent of the vegetated area of the site.

 Subd. 2.  Designation as part of platting for site plan approval.  If a property owner requests natural preserve designation in conjunction with a plat or site plan approval, the property owner shall follow the same requirements set forth in Subd. 1(b) through Subd. 1(f) above.  However, approval of a natural preserve that is requested with the platting or site plan approval process will occur as part of the Council approval of the tree preservation plan or landscaping plan associated with such request rather than in a separate resolution.  (Ord. 2008-08, 3/25/2008; Ord. 2009-08, 5/12/2009) 
 
811.04  Duration.  A natural preserve shall continue to exist until such time as the City determines that a property owner is not meeting the requirements outlined in this Section or until the property owner requests that the designation be removed from the property.  If the City determines that a property owner is not meeting the requirements outlined in this Section, the natural preserve designation shall be revoked and the subject area(s) shall be sodded.

  C. The child is left unattended for an unreasonable period of time considering the totality of the circumstances.  A child left unattended for greater than three minutes constitutes prima facie evidence of child endangerment; or 
 
  D. The child is left unattended in a motor vehicle with unlocked doors with or without an open ignition; or

A caretaker is anyone age 16 or older who assumes or has responsibility for the welfare of the child left in the motor vehicle. 
 
945.03. Penalty.  Any person who violates Section 945.01 is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine and imprisonment consistent with the State law for misdemeanor crimes, plus reasonable prosecution costs.

Section 955 - Graffiti Control 
 
 
955.01. Purpose.   
 
  A. The Council finds that graffiti is an increasing problem in the City.  The Council finds that quick removal of graffiti may assist in preventing encouragement of the defacement of property. 
 
  B. The Council further finds that graffiti creates a condition of blight which can result in the deterioration of property values and is inconsistent with the City’s property maintenance goals and aesthetic standards.  In addition, unless graffiti is removed, other properties soon become the targets of graffiti. 
 
  C. The Council hereby declares its intention to minimize and to quickly remove graffiti to limit its adverse impact on City youth and neighborhoods.  Graffiti is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and a public health and safety hazard for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, Section 429.101, Subd. 1(c) and Section 429.021, Subd. 1(8). 
 
955.02. Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the terms defined in this section shall have the following meaning ascribed to them.   
 
  “Graffiti” shall mean any writing, printing, marks, signs, symbols, figures, designs, inscriptions, or other drawings which are scratched, scrawled, painted, drawn, or otherwise placed on any surface of objects such as buildings, walls, fences, sidewalks, curbs, trees, rocks, or other permanent structures or objects on public or private property or the interior surfaces of those parts of buildings accessible to the general public and which have the effect of defacing the property. 
 
955.03. Unlawful Conduct Regarding Creation of Graffiti.  It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally place graffiti on any surface or the interior surfaces of those parts of buildings structures or property accessible to the general public located on public or private property except with the permission of the person in lawful ownership or possession of such property and in accordance with the requirements of the City’s sign ordinance.  (Ord. 2018-18, 9/25/2018) 
 
955.04. Removal of Graffiti. 
 
A. A property owner may ask the City to remove graffiti from the owner’s property before being ordered to do so following the abatement procedure set forth in Subsections 955.05 through 955.08.  If the City agrees to remove the graffiti, the City shall have the property owner or its designated agent sign a release of liability form and a consent form authorizing the City or its agents to enter onto the property.  In the case of commercial property, the property owner  


 
Plymouth City Code        955.04 
 
 
shall be liable for all costs incurred in removing the graffiti.  In the case of residential property, the ability of the property owner to pay the costs will be assessed.  To remove the graffiti, the City may use City employees, authorize a private contractor.  The City will be responsible for costs incurred with cleanup on public property.  If cleanup is provided by the City, the City may collect the costs as a special assessment pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 429.101, Subd. 1(c) if the property owner fails to reimburse the City upon request.  (Ord. 2018-18, 9/25/2018) 
 
B. If an owner does not remove graffiti and does not ask the City to remove graffiti from the owner’s property before being ordered to do so, the City may remove the graffiti by following the abatement procedure set forth in Subsections 955.05 through 955.08 herein. 
 
955.05. City Police to Identify. 
 
  A. Based upon information received from the public or upon police observation, the Police Department shall investigate and identify graffiti.  After the police department has verified the existence of graffiti, the department shall send a letter to the property owner by certified mail or personal delivery, with affidavit of service, informing the property owner about the graffiti and requesting the removal of the graffiti within a reasonable period of time which shall be less than 30 days, based upon consideration of weather conditions and other relevant factors.  The police department shall verify whether the graffiti has in fact been removed. 
 
  B. If the Police Department finds that the graffiti has not been removed within the time allotted, the department shall contact the City Clerk, who shall schedule a public hearing.  The City Clerk shall notify the affected property owner of the hearing date, the preliminary findings that graffiti exists on the owner’s property, and that the Council may, after the hearing, order the removal of the graffiti by the property owner or the City; and, if the City has to remove the graffiti, the costs will be assessed against the owner’s property. 
 
955.06. Hearing. 
 
  A. At a hearing before the Council, the Council shall receive evidence from the police department and from any other persons with knowledge as to the existence of graffiti.

  3. Request that the owner remove or obliterate the graffiti within a reasonable time as determined by the Council. 
 
   4. Inform the owner that a motion for summary enforcement of the order will be made to the District Court for Hennepin County unless corrective action is taken within the time allotted, or unless an answer is filed within 20 days from the date of service of the order.  An answer to the order must be served in the manner of an answer in a civil action and must specifically deny such facts in the order as are in dispute. 
 
  B. Service of the Order.  The written order shall be served upon the owner of record or the owner’s agent if an agent is in charge of the building or property, and upon the occupying tenant, if there is one, and upon all lienholders of record, in the manner provided for service of a summons in a civil action.  If the owner cannot be found, the order shall be served upon the owner by posting it at the main entrance to the building or upon the structure, and by four weeks published notice in the official newspaper of the City or any legal newspaper in the county. 
 
  C. Filing of Order.  A copy of the order with proof of service shall be filed with the court administrator of the District Court for Hennepin County not less than five days prior to the filing of a motion for enforcement of the order. 
 
  D. Default.  If no answer is served, the City may move the court for the enforcement of the order.  If such motion is made, the court may, upon the presentation of such evidence as it may require, affirm or modify the order and enter judgment accordingly, fixing a time after which the City may proceed with the enforcement of the order and specifically authorizing the City to enter the property to remove or abate the graffiti. 
 
E. Contested Cases.  If an answer is filed and served, further proceedings in the action shall be governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts.  If the order is sustained following the trial, the court shall enter judgment and shall fix a time after which the graffiti must be removed in compliance with the original order as filed or modified by the court.  If the order is not sustained, it shall be annulled and set aside.  The court administrator shall 
Plymouth City Code        955.07 
 
 
cause a copy of the judgment to be mailed forthwith to persons upon whom the original order was served. 
 
  F. Enforcement of judgment.  If the owner of record fails to comply with the judgment by failing to remove the graffiti within the time prescribed, the City may enter the property and remove the graffiti as set forth in the judgment. 
 
955.08. Costs to be Assessed. 
 
  A. In the event the City removes the graffiti, the costs of the removal may be a lien against the real estate on which the building or structure is located, or recovered by obtaining a judgment against the owner of the real estate on which the building or structure is located.  A lien may be levied and collected as a special assessment in the manner provided by Minnesota Statutes, Sections 429.061 to 429.081, but the assessment is payable in a single installment.   
 
  B. The City shall keep an accurate account of the expenses incurred in carrying out the order and of all other expenses incurred in connection with its enforcement including filing fees, witness fees, expert witness fees, and traveling expenses incurred by the City from the time the order was originally made.  The City shall report its action under the order with a statement of expenses incurred to the court for approval and allowance.  The court shall, by its judgment, certify the deficiency in the amount so allowed to the City Clerk for collection. 
 
955.09. Graffiti Abatement Civil in Nature.  Subsection 955.07 or 955.08 relating to the abatement of graffiti shall not be treated as Misdemeanors nor shall they be criminal in nature. 
 
955.10. Penalty.  Any person who violates any provision of Section 955.03 is guilty of a Misdemeanor; and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment consistent with State Law for Misdemeanor crimes, plus the costs of prosecution. 
 
 
(Ord. 97-19, 9/03/97) 


Plymouth City Code       960.01 
 
 
Section 960 - Public Peace and Safety 
 
 
960.01.  Findings and Purpose.  The purpose of this Chapter of the Code is to prohibit certain conduct that is harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of the community and to prevent and abate nuisance conduct, events, characteristics or conditions and their deleterious effects on City neighborhoods by maximizing the means and methods by which public officers can efficiently and effectively enforce the law and by imposing and collecting service call fees from the owner or occupant, or both, of real property to which public officers are repeatedly called to respond to nuisance violations as set forth in this Chapter of the Code.  The Council finds that excessive noise, disruption and other public nuisance activities are injurious to the public health, safety and welfare and interfere with the quiet enjoyment of life and property and that excessive nuisance service calls unduly divert law enforcement resources from general crime prevention and law enforcement.  The excessive nuisance service call fee is intended as a cost recovery mechanism for excessive law enforcement services, over and above the cost of normal law enforcement services to the public, attributable to unabated nuisance conduct, conditions or characteristics occurring, maintained or permitted to exist on the private property.  It is not intended to constitute punishment separate from or in addition to any criminal prosecution for the conduct underlying the nuisance or excessive nuisance service calls.  Nothing herein is meant to limit constitutional rights under the federal or state constitution. 
 
960.02   Definitions.  When used in this Chapter, the following words, terms, and phrases shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
 
 A. Abatement notice.

(Ord. 2002-31, 11/26/2002; Ord. 2004-27, 11/9/2004; Ord. 2005-32, 11/29/2005; Ord. 2007-06, 2/13/2007; Ord. 2007-31, 12/11/2007; Ord. 2008-29, 12/9/2008; Ord. 2009-20, 12/8/2009; Ord. 2012-02, 1/24/2012; Ord. 2013-04, 1/8/2013, Ord. 2014-07, 1/28/2014; Ord. 2015-05, 1/27/2015; Ord. 2016-10, 3/8/2016; Ord. 2017-06, 2/28/2017; Ord. 2018-07, 4-10-2018; Ord. 2019-04, 3/26/2019) 
 
  (2) Volume Charge.  A charge of $4.01 per one thousand gallons of sewage discharged into the City's sanitary sewer system shall be made to each sanitary sewer account except for qualified senior citizens for whom a charge of $3.61 per one thousand gallons will apply.  For purposes of this section, an individual must meet the following criteria for the qualified senior citizen discount to apply:  (1) the individual must be 62 years of age or older; (2) the property must be homesteaded; and (3) the individual’s name must appear on the bill.  Seniors in a multi-unit building will also be eligible for a senior discount if the bylaws, or other governing documents for the building, require that at least one tenant/owner in each unit be at least 62 years of age.  No new enrollment will be accepted into this program beginning 2015.  For residential customers, the volume of such sewage discharge shall be based upon the actual amount of water consumed during the appropriate two month billing, in the period of December through February.  For non-residential customers, the volume of such sewer discharge shall be based upon the actual water consumed by the account each month.  Alternatively, non-residential customers may have their volumes of sewer discharge based on actual sewage flows or calculated sewage flows if sewer usage or sewer deduct meters are installed.  In instances where there is no metered water service to an account or the account history is inadequate, the volume of sewer usage shall be that used for similar classes of property similarly situated.  Alternatively, residential customers who desire to have the volume of sewer discharge based on average winter water usage may install a water meter to meter their well water usage.

Plymouth City Code      1135.01 
 
 
Section 1135 – Therapeutic Massage 
 
 
1135.01. Purpose.  The purpose of this section of the City Code is to prohibit massage businesses and services to the public except those licensed as therapeutic massage enterprises and massage therapists pursuant to this section.  The licensing regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to protect businesses that are operating legitimate enterprises, to prevent criminal activity and to protect the health and welfare of the community.  The purpose of this section is not to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of protected speech or expression. 
 
1135.03. Findings of the City Council.  The City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and services to the public: 
 
A. Persons who have a bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary service to the general public. 

B. Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation. 

C. License qualifications for the restrictions on therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation. 

D. Massage services provided by persons with no specialized and standardized training in massage can endanger citizens by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, and by increasing the risk of personal injury. 

E. Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized training can tax City law enforcement services because such businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity than operations established by persons with standardized training. 

F. The training of professional massage therapists at approved institutions is an important means of ensuring the fullest measure of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 


 
1135.05. Definitions.  The following words and terms when used in this section shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

Plymouth City Code        1150.01 
 
 
Section 1150 - Tobacco and Related Products 
 
 
1150.01. Purpose and Intent.  Because the City recognizes that tobacco use has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government; this ordinance is intended to regulate the sale of tobacco, tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, and to protect minors and young adults against the serious effects associated with use and initiation. 
 
  The City also recognizes that the use of tobacco products has devastating health and economic consequences.  Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death in America.  It causes half a million deaths annually and has been responsible for 20.8 million premature deaths in the U.S. over the past 50 years since the first Surgeon General’s report on smoking in 1964.  This leads to more than $300 billion in health care and lost worker productivity costs each year.  In Minnesota, smoking was responsible for $3.39 billion in excess medical expenditures and the deaths of 6,312 individuals in 2014.  The City further recognizes that young people are particularly susceptible to the addictive properties of tobacco products, and are particularly likely to become lifelong users.  An estimated 5.6 million youth aged 0 to 17 are projected to die prematurely from a tobacco-related illness if prevalence rates to not change.  National data show that about 95 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21.  The ages of 18 to 21 are a critical period when many smokers move from experimental smoking to regular, daily use.  Electronic delivery device use among minors has recently tripled and high among youth.  Young minds are particularly susceptible to the addictive properties of nicotine. As a result, approximately 3 out of 4 teen smokers end up smoking into adulthood.  In 2015, the Institute of Medicine concluded that raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products nationwide will reduce tobacco initiation, particularly among adolescents aged 15 to 17, improve health across the lifespan, and save lives; and that raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products nationwide to 21 would, over time, lead to a 12 percent decrease in smoking prevalence.  The Institute of Medicine also predicts that raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products nationwide to 21would result in 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019, and would result in near immediate reductions in preterm birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome.  In making these findings, the City Council accepts the conclusions and recommendations of the U.S. Surgeon General reports, “E-cigarette Use Among Youth and Young Adults” (2016), “The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress” (2014) and “Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults” (2012); a BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota report, “Health Care Costs and Smoking in Minnesota: The Bottom Line” (2017); the Institute of Medicine in their study, “Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products” (2015); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in their studies, “Tobacco Use Among Middle and High School Students—United States, 2011– 2015,” and “Selected Cigarette Smoking Initiation and Quitting Behaviors Among High School Students, United States, 1997”; and of the following scholars in these scientific journals: Xin Xu et al., Annual Healthcare Spending Attributable to Cigarette Smoking: An Update, Am.

Section 1160 - Pawnbrokers 
 
 
1160.01. Purpose. 
 
 The Council finds that the use of services provided by pawnbrokers potentially provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly.  The Council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers.  The purpose of this Section is to prevent pawn businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City. 
 
 To help the Police Department better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information, this Section also implements and establishes the required use of the Automated Pawn System (APS).

Section 1175 - Sexually Oriented Businesses 
 
1175.01 Purpose and Intent.  Subdivision 1.  It is the purpose of this Section is to regulate Sexually Oriented Businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, to guard against the inception and transmission of disease, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations.  The provisions of this Section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

 Subd. 2.  The Council further finds that experience from other cities demonstrates that Sexually Oriented Businesses conducted in private by members of the same or the opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized training, are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening, subverting or endangering the health, safety and welfare of members of the community by being the sites of acts of prostitution, illicit sex, and occasions of violent crimes, thus requiring close inspection, licensing, and regulation. 
 
1175.03. Classification.  Subdivision 1.  The following are classified as Sexually Oriented Businesses: 
 
 A. Sexually Oriented Arcades;

D. Interest Defined.  The term "interest" as used in this Section includes any pecuniary interest in the ownership, operation, management or profits of a retail liquor establishment, but does not include: bona fide loans; bona fide fixed sum rental agreements; bona fide open accounts or other obligations held with or without security arising out of the ordinary and regular course of business of selling or leasing merchandise, fixtures or supplies to such establishment; or an interest of 10 percent or less in any corporation holding a city liquor license.  A person who receives monies from time to time directly or indirectly from a licensee in the absence of a bona fide consideration therefor and excluding bona fide gifts or donations, shall be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in such retail license. In determining "bona fide", the reasonable value of the goods or things received as consideration for the payment by the licensee and all other facts reasonably tending to prove or disprove the existence of any purposeful scheme or arrangement to evade the prohibitions of this Section shall be considered.  
 
E. Outstanding Debts.  No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any premises on which real estate taxes, assessments, or other financial claims of the City or of the State are due, delinquent, or unpaid.  If an action has been commenced pursuant to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes 278, questioning the amount or validity of taxes, the Council may, on application by the licensee, waive strict compliance with this provision; no waiver may be granted, however, for taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain unpaid for a period exceeding one year after becoming due unless such one-year period is extended through no fault of the licensee.  
 
1201.35. Conditions of Approval.  At the time a license is issued pursuant to this Chapter, the Council may attach special conditions to the approval based upon the nature of the business, the location of the business, and verified complaints, if any, to protect the health, safety, welfare, and quietude of the community and ensure harmony with the location where the business is located.  Violation of any of the conditions shall be grounds for revocation of the license. 
 
1201.37. Distance from School.  No liquor licenses issued in this Chapter, with the exception of temporary liquor licenses, may be granted within 500 feet of any school.  The distance shall be measured from the freestanding parcel or lot upon which the business to be licensed is located or from the exterior wall of the approved area leased or owned by the business to be licensed within a shopping center to the nearest point of the parcel or lot upon which the school is located.  The erection of a school within the prohibited area after the original license application has been granted shall not, in and of itself, render such premises ineligible for renewal of the license. 
 
1201.39. Revocation or Suspension of License.  Subdivision 1.  The Council may suspend or revoke any license for the sale of alcoholic beverages for any of the following reasons: 
Plymouth City Code        1201.39

1201.41. Hearing Notice.  Revocation or suspension of a license by the Council shall be preceded by public hearing conducted in accordance with Minnesota Statutes Section 14.57 to 14.70.  The Council may appoint a hearing examiner or may conduct a hearing itself.  The hearing notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the hearing, include notice of the time and place of the hearing, and state the nature of the charges against the licensee. 
 
1201.43. Presumptive Civil Penalties.  Subdivision 1.  Standards. 
 
 A. Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to establish a standard by which the Council determines the length of license suspensions and the propriety of revocations.  Any licensee found to have violated this Chapter, or whose employee has violated this Chapter, will be charged as noted in the violation grid.  These penalties are presumed to be appropriate for every case; however, the Council may deviate in an individual case where the Council finds that there exist substantial reasons making it more appropriate to deviate, such as, but not limited to, a licensee's efforts in combination with the State or City to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors.  When deviating from these standards, the Council will provide written findings that support the penalty selected. 
Plymouth City Code        1201.43 
 
 
 B. Minimum Penalties for Violations.  The minimum penalties for convictions or violations must be presumed as follows (unless specified, numbers below indicate consecutive days' suspension): 
 
 The following violations require revocation of the license on the first violation: 
 
• Commission of a felony related to the licensed activity. 


 
• Sale of alcoholic beverages while license is under suspension. 


 
• Sale of intoxicating liquor where only license is for 3.2 percent malt liquor. 


 
The following violations fall under the violation grid below for all liquor licenses: 
 
• Failed to comply with any applicable statute, regulation or ordinance relating to alcoholic beverages. 


 
• Sold alcoholic beverages to another retail licensee for the purpose of resale. 


 
• Purchased alcoholic beverages from another retail licensee for the purpose of resale. 


 
• Conducted or permitted the conduct of gambling on the licensed premises in violation of the law. 


 
1st Violation 
 2nd Violation within 36 months 
 3rd Violation within 36 months 
 4th Violation within 36 months 
 
$500 and 5 days stayed suspension 
 $1,000 and 5 days suspension 
 $2,000 and 10 days suspension 
 Revocation 
 

 
Any violation not listed in the previous information would be heard by the Council, and the Council would review all information and circumstances and determine a penalty with the maximum fine of $2,000 and/or 60-day suspension or determine if the license should be revoked. 
 
First violations would be handled by an administrative hearing with the Director of Public Safety with the presumptive penalty given to license holders.  License holders have the right to request a hearing before the Council if not in agreement with the presumptive penalty.  The Director of Public Safety also has the right to request a hearing before the Council if he/she believes there exists substantial reason making it appropriate to deviate from the presumptive penalty.  If the Director of Public Safety and licensee agree on the presumptive penalty, these will be reported to the Council in a staff report. 
Plymouth City Code        1201.43 
 
 
 C. Multiple Violations.  At a licensee's first appearance before the Council, the Council must act upon all of the violations that have been alleged in the notice sent to the licensee.  The Council in that case must consider the presumptive penalty for each violation under the first appearance column in subsection (B) above.  The occurrence of multiple violations is grounds for deviation from the presumed penalties in the Council's discretion. 
 
 D. Subsequent Violations.  Violations occurring after the notice of hearing has been mailed, but prior to the hearing, must be treated as a separate violation and dealt with as a second appearance before the Council, unless the City Manager and licensee agree in writing to add the violation to the first appearance.  The same procedure applies to a second, third, or fourth appearance before the Council. 
 
 E. Subsequent Appearances.  Upon a second, third, or fourth appearance before the council by the same licensee, the Council must impose the presumptive penalty for the violation or violations giving rise to the subsequent appearance without regard to the particular violation or violations that were the subject of the first or prior appearance.  However, the Council may consider the amount of time elapsed between appearances as a basis for deviating from the presumptive penalty imposed by this Section. 
 
 F. Computation of Violations.  Multiple violations are computed by checking the time period of the three years immediately prior to the date of the most current violation. 
 
 G. Other Penalties.  Nothing in this Section shall restrict or limit the authority of the council to suspend up to 60 days, revoke the license, impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, to impose conditions, or take any other action in accordance with law; provided, that the license holder has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing in the manner provided in this Chapter. 
 
1201.45. Retail Sales Regulations.  Subdivision 1.  Right of Inspection. 
 
 A. Any Plymouth police officer or any properly designated officer displaying proper identification shall have the unqualified right to enter, inspect, and search the premises of any licensee hereunder without a warrant, during business hours or when owners, Operating Managers, or other employees are located on the premises.  
 
 B. The business records of the licensee, including Federal and State tax returns, shall be available for inspection by the City at all reasonable times upon written request.

1201.51. Posting License.  The licenses shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the licensed establishment at all times.

 A. No intoxicating liquor shall be sold or furnished or delivered to any obviously intoxicating person, or to any person to whom sale is prohibited by State law. 
 
 B. No person shall give, sell, procure or purchase intoxicating liquor to or for any person to whom the sale of intoxicating liquor is forbidden by law. 
 
1201.55. Building Changes.  Proposed enlargement or substantial alteration which changes the character of the establishment, or extension of premises previously licensed shall be reported to the City Clerk at or before the time application is made for a building permit for any such change.  The enlargement, substantial alteration or extension shall not be allowed unless the Council approves an amendment to the license. 
 
1201.57. Guest Rooms of Hotels.  Subdivision 1.  Liquor Sales.  No sale of liquor shall be made to or in guest rooms of hotels unless: 
 
 A. Such sale accompanies and is incidental to the regular service of meals to guests therein; 
 
 B. The guest rooms and any meeting and/pool and outdoor seating areas are included as part of the licensed premises in the liquor application.

Lot owners may not allow interments to be made on their lots for remuneration.

SECTION 21000 - TITLE AND APPLICATION 
 
 
21000.01. TITLE:   This Chapter shall be known as the “Plymouth Zoning Ordinance” except as referred to herein, where it shall be known as “this Chapter”. 
 
 
21000.02. INTENT AND PURPOSE:   The intent of this Chapter is to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community and its people through the establishment of minimum regulations in regard to location, erection, construction, alteration and use of structures and land.  These regulations are established to assist the City in 1) implementing its Comprehensive Plan, 2) protecting and enhancing the natural environment and resources that currently exist within the City, 3) ensuring orderly and quality development and redevelopment, 4) protecting the quality and diversity of the City’s tax base, 5) protecting the quality of residential neighborhoods, 6) providing opportunities for an affordable and diverse housing supply,  7) managing traffic, 8) ensuring compatibility between different land uses, and 9) regulating businesses that may have adverse secondary effects on the quality of life of Plymouth residents.  These regulations are also established to provide for administration of this Chapter, to provide for amendments; to prescribe penalties for violation of such regulations; and to define powers and duties of the City staff, the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals, the Planning Commission and the City Council in relation to the Zoning Ordinance. 
 
 
21000.03. RELATION TO COMPREHENSIVE MUNICIPAL PLAN:   It is the policy of the City of Plymouth that the enforcement, amendment, and administration of this Chapter be accomplished consistent with the recommendations contained in the City Comprehensive Plan, as developed and amended from time to time by the Planning Commission and City Council of the City.  The Council recognizes the City Comprehensive Plan as the official policy for the regulation of land use and development in accordance with the policies and purpose herein set forth.  In accordance with Minnesota Statutes Chapter 473, the City will not approve any rezoning or other changes in these regulations that are inconsistent with the City Comprehensive Plan. 
 
 
21000.04. STANDARD, REQUIREMENT:   Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this Chapter are either more or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by other law, ordinance, rule, or regulation of the city, state, or federal government, the law, ordinance, rule, or regulation which imposes the more restrictive condition, standard, or requirement shall prevail. 
 
 
21000.05. CONFORMITY WITH THIS CHAPTER:   No structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or altered, and no structure or land shall be used for any purpose nor in any manner which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter. 
 
 
21000.06. BUILDING COMPLIANCE:   Except as herein provided, no building, structure or premises shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building permit shall be granted that does not conform to the requirements of this Chapter. 
 
 
21000.07. REDUCTION OF YARDS OR LOTS NOT PERMITTED:   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this Chapter shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein.  Yards or lots created after the effective date of this Chapter shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this Chapter. 
 
 
21000.08. MONUMENTS:   For the purpose of this Chapter, all international, federal, state, county and other official monuments, benchmarks, triangulation points, and stations shall be preserved in their precise locations; and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that these markers are maintained in good condition during and following construction and development.  All section, one-quarter section and one-sixteenth section corners shall be duly described and tied. 
 
 
21000.09. USES NOT PROVIDED FOR WITHIN ZONING DISTRICTS:   Whenever in any zoning district a use is not specifically allowed as a permitted accessory, conditional, or interim use, nor is such use allowed by administrative permit, the use shall be considered prohibited.  In such cases, the City Council or the Planning Commission, on their own initiative or upon request, may conduct a study to determine if the use is acceptable and if so, what zoning district would be most appropriate and the determination as to conditions and standards relating to development of the use.  The City Council, Planning Commission or property owner, upon receipt of the staff study may, if appropriate, initiate an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to provide for the particular use under consideration or may find that the use is not compatible for development within the City.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2001-06, 02/13/01) 
 
 
21000.10. SEPARABILITY:   It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City that the several provisions of this Chapter are separable in accordance with the following: 
 
 Subd. 1. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this Chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provisions of this Chapter not specifically included in said judgment. 
 
 Subd. 2. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this Chapter to a particular property, building, or other structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said provision to any other property, building, or structure not specifically included in said judgment. 
 
 
21000.11. AUTHORITY:   This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the Municipal Planning Act, Minnesota Statutes, Section 462.351 to 462.363. 
 
 
21000.12 ZONING MAP:   The locations and boundaries of the district established by this Ordinance are hereby set forth on the Plymouth, Minnesota Zoning Map; and said Map is hereby made a part of this Ordinance; said Map shall be known as the “Plymouth, Minnesota Zoning Map.”  Said Map and all notations, references and data shown thereon are hereby incorporated by reference into this Ordinance and shall be as much a part of it as if all were fully described herein.  It shall be the responsibility of the Zoning Administrator to maintain said Map, and amendments thereto shall be recorded on said Zoning Map within thirty (30) days after official publication of amendments.  The official Zoning Map shall be kept on file in the City Hall. 
 
 
21000.13 ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:   The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated, either the center line of streets, alleys or railroad rights-of-way or lot lines or section lines or such centerlines or lot lines parallel or perpendicular thereto.

 Wetland Related: 
 
 Wetland:   Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water.  For purposes of this definition, wetlands must have three (3) of the following attributes: 
 
(a) A predominance of hydric soils; 
 
(b) Inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; 
 
(c) Under normal circumstances, support a prevalence of such vegetation. 
 
 Wetland Buffer Strip:   An area of vegetated ground cover abutting a wetland that, either in its natural condition or through intervention, has the characteristics identified in Section 21670.08 of this Chapter.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2011-22, 07/26/11) 
 
 Wetlands, Exceptional Quality:   Exceptional quality wetlands contain an abundance of different plant species with dominance evenly spread among several species.  Such wetlands may support some rare or unusual plant species.  Invasive or exotic plant species are either absent or limited to small areas where some disturbance has occurred.  This higher level of plant species diversity generally provides high wildlife habitat value and may also support rare wildlife species.  The shorelines of exceptional quality wetlands are natural and unaffected by erosion.  These wetlands exhibit no evidence of significant man induced water level fluctuation.  Exceptional quality wetlands provide excellent water quality protection, high aesthetic quality, and provide excellent opportunities for educational and scientific activities within the community. 
 
 Wetlands, High Quality:   High quality wetlands are still generally in their natural state and tend to show less evidence of adverse effects of surrounding land uses.  Exotic and invasive plant species may be present and species dominance may not be evenly distributed among several species, however, a minimum of twenty (20) different species can be found within the basin.  There tends to be little evidence of water level fluctuation due to storms and their shorelines are stable with little evidence of erosion.  The combination of these factors result in these wetlands being judged as providing a greater level of water quality protection and significantly better wildlife habitat.  They show little if any evidence of human influences and their greater levels of species diversity, wildlife habitat and ecological stability results in higher aesthetic quality.  These characteristics also offer opportunities for educational or scientific value to the community. 
 
 Wetlands, Low Quality:   Wetlands included in this category have been substantially altered by agricultural or urban development that caused over nutrification, soil erosion, sedimentation and water quality degradation.  As a result of these factors, these wetlands exhibit low levels of plant species and a related reduction in the quality of wildlife habitat.  These wetlands may also tend to exhibit extreme water level fluctuations in response to storms and show evidence of shoreline erosion.  While these wetlands do provide for water quality and serve an important role in protecting water quality downstream, the combination of these characteristics cause these wetlands to provide low levels of water quality protection and to have poor aesthetic quality.  They often exhibit evidence of significant human influences and they are deemed to be of little educational or scientific value to the community. 
 
 Wetlands, Medium Quality:   Medium quality wetlands have a slightly higher number of plant species present than low quality wetlands, often with small pockets of indigenous species within larger areas dominated by invasive or exotic species.  Their relatively greater species diversity results in slightly better wildlife habitat.  They exhibit evidence of relatively less fluctuation in water level in response to storms and less evidence of shoreline erosion.  As a 
result of these characteristics, these wetlands provide somewhat better water quality protection.  They also exhibit relatively less evidence of human influences and therefore, tend to be of a higher aesthetic quality.

SECTION 21040 - ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 
 
 
21040.01. PURPOSE:   The purpose of this section is to determine whether certain projects have or may have the potential for significant environmental effects and should undergo special procedures of the Minnesota Environmental Review Program. 
 
 
21040.02. GENERAL PROVISIONS:    
 
 Subd. 1. No development project shall be approved prior to review by the Zoning Administrator to determine the necessity for completion of an Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  Procedures for EAWs and EISs are set forth in the Minnesota Environmental Quality Review Board (EQB) regulations for the Environmental Review Program authorized by Minnesota Statute 116D.04 and 116D.04S and specified in Minnesota Rules Parts 4410.0200 to 4410.7800. 
 
 Subd. 2. Environmental reviews (EAWs and EISs) shall be conducted as early as practical in the processing of a development project.  Time delays in the normal permit process caused by the filing and review of the EAW or EIS shall not be considered part of the permit approval time requirements set forth within this Chapter.  Such delays shall be considered as additional required time for each required permit.  The permit process for the proposed project may be continued from the point it was interrupted by the EAW/EIS process.  No decision on granting a permit or other approval required to commence the project may be issued until the EAW/EIS process is completed. 
 
 
21040.03. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT WORKSHEETS (EAWs):    
 
 Subd. 1. Purpose.  The purpose of an EAW is to rapidly assess, in a worksheet format, whether or not a proposed action has the potential for significant environmental effects. 
 
 Subd. 2. Mandatory EAWs.  The preparation of an EAW shall be mandatory for those projects that meet or exceed the thresholds contained in the State Environmental Review Program regulations, Minnesota Rules 4410.4300, as may be amended. 
 
 Subd. 3. Discretionary EAWs.  A discretionary EAW may be required when it is determined that, because of the nature or location of a proposed project, the project may have the potential for significant environmental effects.  The Zoning Administrator may suggest and/or the City Council may require the preparation of a discretionary EAW if it is determined that a development project may have some significant environmental impact or when there is a perception of such, provided that the project is not specifically exempted by Minnesota Rules 4410.4600, as may be amended. 
 
 Subd. 4. Procedures. 
 
(a) Preparation and Distribution. 
 
(1) If the Zoning Administrator determines that an EAW shall be prepared, the proposer of the project shall submit an “Application for Environmental Review” along with the completed data portions of the EAW.  An EAW shall be accompanied by a fee and a cash escrow as set forth in the City Code.  Costs of city time and materials expended in reviewing and processing the application shall be charged against the cash escrow account and credited to the city.  If, at any time, the balance in the cash escrow account is depleted to less than 10% of the originally required cash escrow amount, the project proposer shall deposit additional funds in the cash escrow account as determined by the Zoning Administrator.  Any balance remaining in the cash escrow account upon completion of the EAW process shall be returned to the project proposer after all claims and charges thereto have been deducted.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2010-21, 11/23/10) 
 
(2) Pursuant to Minnesota Rules 4410.1400, the Zoning Administrator shall promptly review the submittal for completeness and accuracy.  If the Zoning Administrator determines that the submittal is incomplete, the submittal shall be returned to the proposer for completion of the missing data.  If the Zoning Administrator determines that the submittal is complete, the proposer shall be notified of the acceptance of the submittal within five days.  The Zoning Administrator shall have 30 days from notification to add supplementary material to the EAW, if necessary, and to approve the EAW for distribution.  (Amended by Ord. No. 99-5, 01/19/99) 
 
 (3) Within five (5) days of approving the EAW for distribution, the Zoning Administrator shall distribute copies of the EAW to the EQB for publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB  Monitor.  Copies shall be distributed at the same time to the official EAW distribution list maintained by the EQB staff.  Within five (5) days of submission of the EAW to the EQB, the Zoning Administrator shall provide a press release to the City’s official newspaper, containing notice of availability of the EAW for public review. 
 
(b) Neighboring Property Owner Notification. 
 
(1) Upon completion of the EAW for distribution, the Zoning Administrator shall provide mailed notice of the availability of the EAW and date of the meeting at which the Planning Commission will consider the matter to all property owners within at least seven hundred and fifty (750) feet of the boundaries of the property which is the subject of the EAW.  Said notice shall be mailed at minimum ten (10) days before the date of the Planning Commission meeting during which the EAW will be considered.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2001-06, 02/13/01) 
 
(2) Failure of a property owner to receive notice shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set forth within this Chapter. 
 
(c) Review by Planning Commission.  During the thirty (30) day comment period that follows publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB Monitor, the Planning Commission shall review the EAW.  The Commission shall make recommendations to the City Council regarding potential environmental impacts that may 
warrant further investigation before the project is commenced and the need for an EIS on the proposed project. 
 
(d) Decision by City Council.  The City Council shall make its decision on the need for an EIS for the proposed project at its first meeting more than ten (10) days but not more than thirty (30) days after the close of the comment period.  The Council shall base its decision on the need for an EIS and the proposed scope of an EIS on the information gathered during the EAW process and on the comments received on the EAW.  Pursuant to Minnesota Rules 4410,1700, in deciding whether a project has the potential for significant environmental effects, the following factors shall be considered: 
 
(1) Type, extent and reversibility of environmental effects.

(b) The term of the financial guarantee shall be for the life of the site improvement performance agreement, and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that a submitted financial guarantee shall continue in full force and effect until the Zoning Administrator shall have approved and accepted all of the work undertaken to be done and shall thereby have released the guarantee or reduced the amount of the guarantee as provided in this Section.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2002-02, 01/22/02) 
 
(c) When any instrument submitted as a financial guarantee contains provision for an automatic expiration date, after which the instrument may not be drawn upon, not withstanding the status of the site improvement performance agreement or of the required work, the expiration date shall be October 31; further, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to notify the City in writing, by certified mail, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration date of the intention to renew the instrument or to not renew the instrument.

 Subd. 4. The time allowed for completion of the required improvements shall be set out in the site improvement performance agreement.

As various portions of such required work are completed by the applicant and approved by the City, the Zoning Administrator may release such portion of the financial guarantee as is attributable to such completed work.  Landscaping improvements shall not be deemed complete until the City has verified survivability of all required plantings through one winter season which is defined for the purpose of this Section as the period October 31 through April 30. 
 
 Subd. 5. At the time of execution of the agreement and prior to the issuance of building permits, the applicant shall provide to the City of Plymouth a cash escrow to pay for the costs of administering the site improvement performance agreement.

The cash escrow shall equal 2 percent of the estimated cost of proposed improvements, as identified in the agreement, to a maximum amount of $3,000.  Administrative costs shall be charged against the cash escrow account and credited to the city.  If, at any time prior to completion of the site improvement performance agreement administration process, the balance in the cash escrow account is depleted to less than 10 percent of the originally required cash escrow amount, the applicant shall deposit additional funds in the cash escrow account as determined by the Zoning Administrator.  Any balance remaining in the cash escrow account upon completion of the site improvement performance agreement administration process shall be returned to the applicant after all claims and charges thereto have been deducted.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2011-22, 07/26/11)

 Subd. 7. The applicant shall notify the City in writing when all or a portion of the required improvements have been completed in accordance with the approved plan and may be inspected.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the inspection of the improvements to determine that the useful life of all work performed meets the average standards for the particular industry, profession, or material used in the performance of the work.  Any required work failing to meet such standards shall not be deemed to be complete and the applicant shall be notified in writing as to required corrections.  Upon determination that the work has been completed, including the winter season survivability of all landscape improvements, appropriate action to reduce or release the amount of the financial guarantee shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator.

 Subd. 1. Conditional Uses.   Any established use, building or lot legally existing prior to 1 January 1997 and which is herein classified by this Chapter as requiring a conditional use permit may be continued in like fashion and activity and shall automatically be considered as having received conditional use permit approval.

Any change to such a use or building shall, however, require a new interim use permit be processed according to this Chapter. 
 
 Subd. 4.   Threats to General Welfare.  Non-conforming buildings, structures, and/or uses, which based upon documented study and evidence, pose a danger and/or threat to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, shall:

(b) Upon being identified by the City Council and upon the owner being notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator, the owner shall provide to the City Council a documented time schedule and program with rationale to support the proposed amortization of the building, structure, or use investments which will result in the termination or correction of the non-conformity. 
 
(1) The termination/correction time schedule shall be based upon, but not be limited to factors such as the initial investment and the degree of threat or danger being posed. 
 
(2) The acceptability of the time schedule shall be determined by the City Council with right of appeal.

(2) Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than fifty (50) percent of its market value, as determined by the City Building Official, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged.  If a building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged, the City may impose reasonable conditions when issuing the permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property. 
 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above, any nonconforming use located in the floodplain overlay district that is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of 
greater than fifty (50) percent of its market value, as determined by the City Building Official, shall be regulated to the extent necessary to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program, and in no case shall be continued or re-established in a manner that results in potential flood damage or obstructs flood flows in the floodway.

A lawful, non-conforming use may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement; provided, however, that no such non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased, nor shall any such non-conforming use be expanded to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the adoption of this Chapter, nor shall any such non-conforming use be moved to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was conducted at the time of the adoption of this Chapter.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2002-02, 01/22/02)   
 
(c) Changes to Non-Conforming Uses. 
 
(1) When a lawful non-conforming use of any structure or land in any district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any non-conforming use. 
 
(2) A lawful non-conforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to lessen the non-conformity of use. Once a non-conforming structure or parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to increase the non-conformity. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2005-01, 01/11/05)

For purposes of this subsection, the minimum required structure setback from lot lines shall be either the existing setback of such lawful non-conforming structure or the setback as otherwise specified in this Chapter, whichever is less.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2002-02, 01/22/02)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2010-14, 08/10/10) 
 
(2) Conditional Use Permit.  Lawful non-conforming commercial, industrial, public, semi-public, and multiple family structures may be expanded on the same lot by conditional use permit provided:

21130.03. REQUIRED FENCING, SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING: 
 
Subd. 1. Fencing and Screening.  
 
(a) Multiple Family Uses.   
 
(1) Where any townhouse, manor home, manufactured home park or apartment dwelling structure abuts property zoned for less dense residential use, the higher density residential use shall provide screening along all off-street parking or formal outdoor recreational activity areas to mitigate possible adverse impacts.    Housing of similar types and densities shall not be subject to special screening requirements for formal outdoor recreational activity areas.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2002-02, 01/22/02) 
 
(2) Along boundaries where parking or formal outdoor recreational activity areas exist, all the fencing and screening specifically required by this Chapter shall be subject to Section 21105.05 and shall consist of either a fence or a green belt planting strip as provided for below. 
 
a. A green belt planting strip shall consist of evergreen trees and/or deciduous trees and plants and shall be of sufficient width and density to provide an effective visual buffer.  This planting strip shall be designed to provide complete visual screening to a minimum height of six feet.  Alternatively, earth mounding or berms may be used to achieve all or a portion of the required buffer.  The screening plan including type of plantings and berming shall require the approval of the City, as part of the site plan review pursuant to Section 21045 of this Chapter. 
 
b. A required screening fence shall be constructed of masonry, brick, wood or metal.  Such fence shall provide a solid screening effect of six feet in height.  The design and materials used in constructing a required screening fence shall be subject to 
the approval of the City as part of the site plan review pursuant to Section 21045 of this Chapter.  Fences in excess of height limitations established in Section 21130.01 shall be subject to approval pursuant to required procedures.  The City Council may also require plantings of shrubs or trees in association with required fencing. 
 
(b) Non-Residential Uses.   
 
(1) Where any non-residential use (i.e., structure, parking or storage) abuts property zoned for residential use, the non-residential use shall provide screening along its boundary with the residential property.  Screening shall also be provided where a non-residential use is across the street from a residential zone, but not on that side of a non-residential use considered to be the front (as determined by the Zoning Administrator).  All the fencing and screening specifically required by this Chapter shall be subject to Section 21105.05 and shall consist of either a fence or a green belt strip as provided for in Section 21130.03, Subd. 1.a.2.a and Subd. 1.a.2.b. 
 
 Subd. 2. Landscaping - Public, Semi-Public, Institutional, Single Family, Two Family, Multiple Family, Manufactured Home Park, Commercial, and Industrial Uses.  Prior to approval of a building permit, all above referenced uses shall be subject to mandatory landscape plan and specification requirements.

(2) To the extent possible, native drought-resistant trees shall be planted. 
 
(3) All types and species of overstory and understory deciduous and coniferous trees and their cultivars shall be consistent with the City of Plymouth’s Landscape Tree List, as provided by the City Forester. 
 
(4) The complement of trees fulfilling the requirements of this Section shall be not less than 25 percent deciduous and not less than 25 percent coniferous. 
 
(c) Number of Trees.  The minimum number of new trees on any given site shall be as follows: 
 
(1) Residential Uses.   Single family and two family dwellings shall require two trees (may be new trees or preserved pre-existing trees) within the front yard, at least one of which must be an overstory tree.  Townhouse dwellings, manor home dwellings, and manufactured home parks shall require a minimum of two new overstory trees per dwelling unit.  Apartment developments shall require trees as follows:  
 
a. Developments with 50 or fewer dwelling units shall require a minimum of two new overstory trees per dwelling unit;  


 
b. Developments with more than 50 dwelling units shall require a minimum of 1.5 new overstory trees per dwelling unit; and 


 
c. Developments within the RMF-5 district shall require 0.75 new overstory trees per dwelling unit.   


 
d. If the planting provision results in overcrowding, as determined by the city, the developer may plant fewer trees on the site, provided a cash fee in accordance with Section 530 of the City Code is deposited in the Community Planting Fund to make up the difference between the trees required by this provision and the trees actually planted on the site. 


 
(2) Non-Residential Uses -- New Development.   New non-residential developments or uses shall require at a minimum the greater of: 
 
a. One new overstory tree per 50 lineal feet of site perimeter; or  
 
b. One new overstory tree per 1,000 square feet of gross building floor area.  If the floor area ratio (FAR) for the site would be 0.5 or greater, the developer may plant fewer trees on the site than required by this provision to prevent overcrowding, provided a cash fee in accordance with Section 530 of the City Code is deposited in the Community Planting Fund to make up the difference between the trees required by this provision and the trees actually planted on the site. 
 
(3) Non-Residential Uses -- Expansion to Existing Development.  Expansion of existing non-residential developments or uses shall require at a minimum one new overstory tree per 1,000 square feet of expanded gross floor area. 
 
(4) Overstory Trees/Equivalency.   Up to 50 percent of the required number of overstory trees on a site may be substituted with an equivalent number of understory trees or shrubs.  In such case, three understory trees or ten shrubs shall be equivalent to one overstory tree.

SECTION 21135 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 
 
 
21135.01. PURPOSE:   The regulation of off-street parking spaces in these zoning regulations is intended to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public right-of-way and to promote the safety and general welfare of the public, by establishing minimum requirements for off-street parking of motor vehicles in accordance with the intensity of utilization of the various parcels of land or structures. 
 
 
21135.02. SCOPE OF REGULATIONS:   The off-street parking requirements of this Chapter shall apply within all zoning districts for uses and structures, except as hereinafter provided. 
 
 
21135.03. GENERAL PROVISIONS: 
 
 Subd. 1. Application.    
 
(a) For the purposes of this Chapter, the off-street parking provisions of this section shall apply to all motorized vehicles including, but not limited to, passenger automobiles, trucks, vans, and motorcycles, unless otherwise specified herein. 
 
(b) For the purpose of determining off-street parking and loading requirements, Commercial Districts include the O, Office District.  Except where otherwise allowed by this Chapter, requirements for the P-I District shall be the same as for Commercial District.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2002-02, 01/22/02) 
 
 Subd. 2. Site Plans.  All site plans submitted for a structure requiring parking spaces and/or loading facilities shall show or designate the parking and/or loading area(s), number of parking spaces, and type of surfacing, screening, drainage, curbing, sidewalks, and other improvements which may be required to be installed.  Said plan shall be a part of the building permit for any such structure, and except for one and two family dwellings, no final certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all items shown on the plan for parking and loading facilities have been completed, unless an agreement supported by a financial security is provided for the completion of said plan.  For lots of record established after 1 January 1997, all site plans for single family homes must provide for location of a one stall attached garage, whether or not construction is intended.

 Subd. 4. The City’s zoning regulations have, since early as 1971, included the regulation of signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the business community, while protecting the City and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community.  The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within the City has had a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community.

Subd. 1. Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and other physical characteristics of signs in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
 
 Subd. 2. Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment by preventing visual clutter that is detrimental to the appearance and vitality of the community. 
 
 Subd. 3. Improve the visual appearance of the City while providing for effective means of communication consistent with constitutional guarantees and the City’s goals of public safety and aesthetics.

SECTION 21360 - RSF-2, SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED DWELLING DISTRICT 2 
 
 
21360.01. PURPOSE:   The purpose of the Single Family Detached Dwelling District 2 (RSF-2) is to provide for new single family neighborhoods with a lot size that is smaller than the City’s traditional single family lot as well as directly related, complementary uses.  The smaller lot size will make better use of the City’s shrinking land supply and investment in public utilities and allow the City to better protect and preserve its natural resources such as wetlands and woodlands.

SECTION 21655 - PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
 
 
21655.01. PURPOSE AND INTENT:   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to provide a comprehensive procedure intended to allow greater flexibility in the development of neighborhoods or non-residential areas than would be possible under a conventional zoning district.  The decision to zone property to PUD is a public policy decision for the City Council to make in its legislative capacity.  The intent of this section is to:   
 
 Subd. 1. Provide for the establishment of Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning districts in appropriate settings and situations, to create or maintain a development pattern that complies with the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 
 
 Subd. 2. Allow for the mixing of land uses within a development when such mixing of land uses could not otherwise be accomplished under this Chapter. 
 
 Subd. 3. Provide for variations to the strict application of the land use regulations in this Chapter in order to improve site design and operation, while at the same time incorporating design elements (e.g., construction materials, landscaping, lighting, etc.) that exceed the City’s standards to offset the effect of any variations. 
 
 Subd. 4. Promote a more creative and efficient approach to land use within the City, while at the same time protecting and promoting the health, safety, comfort, aesthetics, economic viability, and general welfare of the City. 
 
 Subd. 5. Preserve and enhance natural features and open spaces. 
 
 Subd. 6. Maintain or improve the efficiency of public streets and utilities. 
 
 Subd. 7. Ensure the establishment of appropriate transitions between differing land uses. 
 
 Subd. 8. Provide for the maintenance of, and an amendment procedure for, those planned unit developments listed in Section 21100.02 Subd. 2 (b) of this Chapter. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2000-06, 02/29/00)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2002-32, 11/26/02) 
 
 
21655.02. USES:   All permitted uses, permitted accessory uses, conditional uses, interim uses, and uses allowed by administrative permit contained in Sections 21350 through 21650 of this Chapter shall be treated as potentially allowable uses within a PUD District, provided they would be allowable on the site under the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2000-06, 02/29/00) 
 
 
21655.03. SETBACKS, LOT AREA, AND BUILDING HEIGHT:   The various setback, lot area, and height regulations of the most closely related conventional zoning district shall be considered presumptively appropriate, but may be departed from to accomplish the purposes described in Section 21655.01. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2000-06, 02/29/00)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2014-12, 02/25/14) 
 
 
21655.04. INTEGRATED DESIGN:   A PUD shall consist of a harmonious arrangement and selection of land uses in groupings of buildings that are planned and designed as an integrated unit.  The integrated design shall include elements such as building orientation and materials, utilities, parking areas, traffic and pedestrian circulation, and open spaces. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2000-06, 02/29/00) 
 
 
21655.05 PRE-APPLICATION SKETCH REVIEW:   Prior to the filing of a PUD general plan application, the applicant may submit a sketch of the project to the Zoning Administrator.  The sketch will be reviewed in accordance with Section 21045.03 of this Chapter. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2000-06, 02/29/00)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2004-02, 01/13/04) 
 
 
21655.06 GENERAL PLAN:   A PUD general plan is a plan and supportive text depicting general land use, circulation, open space, utilities, etc. for parcels of land within a PUD. 
 
 Subd. 1. Application Procedure:  PUD zoning applications shall be processed according to the evaluation criteria and procedures outlined in Section 21010.01 of this Chapter.  The general plan shall be accompanied by a fee and a cash escrow as set forth in the City Code.  Costs of city time and materials expended in reviewing and processing the general plan application shall be charged against the cash escrow account and credited to the city.  If, at any time, the balance in the cash escrow account is depleted to less than 10 percent of the originally required cash escrow amount, the applicant shall deposit additional funds in the cash escrow account as determined by the Zoning Administrator.  Any balance remaining in the cash escrow account upon completion of the general plan review process shall be returned to the applicant after all claims and charges thereto have been deducted. 
 
 Subd. 2. Information Requirement:

SECTION 21660 - FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT 
 
 
21660.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:  The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Plymouth, Minnesota, does ordain as follows. 
 
 
21660.02 PURPOSE:    
Subd. 1. This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the City of Plymouth. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. 
 
Subd. 2. This ordinance is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
 
Subd. 3. This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
 
 
21660.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS: 
Subd. 1. How to Use this Ordinance.  This ordinance adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the City of Plymouth and includes 3 floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain.  
(a) Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in Sections 21660.05 or 21660.06 will apply, depending on the location of a property. 


 
(b) Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within the General Floodplain district, the Floodway District standards in Section 21660.05 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in Section 21660.07, Subd. 2. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District standards in 21660.06 may apply outside the floodway. 


 
Subd. 2. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies.  This ordinance applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Plymouth shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the 
attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain Districts. 
(a) Overlay Districts.  The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this ordinance. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply. 
(b)  Incorporation of Maps by Reference.  The following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the Official Zoning Map and this ordinance. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016 and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016, all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator.

 Subd. 3.    Rules and Interpretation. 
 
(a) Interpretation.  The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.   
(1) Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The Zoning Administrator shall interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data. 
(2) Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council and to submit technical evidence. 
(b) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements. Where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance prevail.  All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.  
(c) Disclaimer of Liability.  This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of the City of Plymouth or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(d) Annexations.  The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section 21660.03, Subd. 2. may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of Plymouth at the time of adoption of this ordinance.  If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of Plymouth after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation.

(b) Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses.   
(1)   The use shall have a low flood damage potential. 
(2)   The use shall not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in flood elevations and shall not involve structures, obstructions, or storage of materials or equipment. 
 
(3) Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public shall be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of 4 upon occurrence of the regional (1 percent chance) flood. 
 
Subd. 2.   Conditional Uses.   
 
(a) The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses following the standards and procedures set forth in Section 21660.08, Subd. 4 and further subject to the standards set forth in Section 21660.05, Subd. 2.

(2) Fill and Storage of Materials and Equipment.  
 a. Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials temporarily deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. The placement shall not increase the stage of the 1 percent chance or regional flood. 
 
 (3) Accessory structures as identified in Section 21660.05, Subd. 2 (a) (1), may be permitted, provided that: 
 
a. The structure(s) is(are) not intended for human habitation; 
b. The structures shall have a low flood damage potential; 
c. The structures shall be constructed and placed so as to offer a minimal obstruction to the flow of flood waters; 
d.  Service utilities, such as, but not limited to, electrical and heating equipment, within these structures shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed;  
e. Structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofed classification in accordance with the Minnesota State Building Code. All floodproofed structures shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
 
f. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State

(8) Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. Any facilities used by employees or the general public shall be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of 4 upon occurrence of the regional (1 percent chance) flood. 
(9) Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations shall be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location. 
 
Subd. 2. Conditional Uses.  
 
(a) The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following the procedures in Section 21660.08, Subd. 4.  
(1) Storage of materials or equipment and any related placement of fill necessary to raise the storage area above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(2) The placement of more than 50 cubic yards of fill consistent with Sections 21185 and 21665.09 for purposes other than storage of materials or equipment or to raise structures above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(b) Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses.  The following standards shall apply to all conditional uses. 
(1)   Storage of materials and equipment shall be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(2) All service utilities, including ductwork, shall be elevated or water-tight to prevent infiltration of floodwaters.

(6) Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations shall be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In 
considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location. 
(7) Basements are subject to the following: 
a. Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
b. Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with classifications in the State Building Code.  Structurally dry floodproofing shall meet the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.   
(8)   The placement of fill on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure) shall comply with an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan consistent with the requirements of Section 21045.07. 
a. The plan shall clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1 percent chance) flood event. 
b. The plan shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City Council. 
c. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
 
 
21660.07 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (GF)  
 
Subd. 1.  Permitted Uses:   
 
(a)  The uses listed in Section 21660.05, Subd. 1. 
(b)   All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria specified in 21660.07, Subd. 2.  Section 21660.05 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway District. Section 21660.06 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe District. 
Subd. 2. Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations.   
(a)    Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source.   
(b) If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant shall furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the Floodway 
or Flood Fringe District. Information shall be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in 21660.07, Subd. 2. (c).  
(c)  The determination of floodway and flood fringe shall include the following components, as applicable:  
(1) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1 percent chance) flood. 
(2) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
(3) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(d)  The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary. The assessment shall include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources.  Based on this assessment, the Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application. 
(e) Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been determined, the Zoning Administrator shall process the permit or other application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 21660.05 or 21660.06.

SECTION 21670 - WETLANDS DISTRICT 
 
 
21670.01. FINDINGS, INTENT AND INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: 
 
 Subd. 1. The City has determined that wetlands serve to maintain water quality by filtering water that is discharged into ground water aquifers and by retaining inorganic sediments, toxicants, and nutrients.  They also retain and reduce the discharge of phosphorus and transform nutrients from their inorganic to organic forms, thereby, protecting streams and water bodies from eutrophication and contamination.  Wetlands also store runoff and reduce the velocity of and magnitude of flood peaks.  In addition, some wetlands receive the upward discharge of ground water.  These wetlands tend to support more stable biological communities since their water temperatures and water levels tend to be more stable. 
 
 Subd. 2. Wetland vegetation also reduces the energy of waves, currents, and other erosive forces and serves to prevent the erosion of shoreline areas.  In addition, aquatic vegetation provides food, shelter, and special habitat for wildlife.  All of these wetland characteristics provide valuable recreation and education resources. 
 
 Subd. 3. The City has also found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered.  Wetlands within the City exhibit great variations in their floral diversity, quality of wildlife and fishery habitat, degree of fluctuation in response to storms, the extent to which their shorelines have been altered or eroded, and their relative value in protecting water quality.  Therefore, the City has determined that it is necessary and beneficial to classify wetlands based upon their functions and values.  The City has also found that it is in the best interest of the general health and welfare of the City to achieve no net loss of wetlands within the community.  
 
 Subd. 4. The City recognizes that a substantial amount of wetland degradation results from sedimentation and nutrient loading related to construction projects.  Therefore, the City finds it necessary to require extraordinary measures to prevent such construction-related degradation. 
 
 Subd. 5. In addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas the City also finds that it is necessary to regulate the use of lands surrounding wetlands.  Wetland buffer strips (as defined by Section 21005), are necessary and beneficial to maintaining the health of wetlands.  These strips of land surrounding wetlands protect their shorelines from erosion, while serving to filter sediment, chemicals and other nutrients before storm water discharges into the wetland.  Wetland buffer strips are also beneficial in providing habitat for wildlife.  
 
 Subd. 6. This Section hereby incorporates by reference the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991 [Minn. Stat. 103G.221 et seq. (herein after referred to as the WCA)] and any future amendments adopted by the legislature.  Any activities exempted from the provisions of the WCA are also exempted from the requirements of this Section, insofar as they relate to the WCA.  All wetlands, as defined in Section 21005 of this Chapter, including those governed by 
the Department of Natural Resources, are covered by the provisions of this Section.  Also, there are circumstances under which the strict enforcement of these regulations may be unreasonable, and in circumstances that meet the criteria established in Section 21030 and subsection 21670.10 of this Chapter, departures from the strict application of these standards may be permitted. 
 
 Subd. 7. It is the intent of this Section to avoid the alteration and destruction of wetlands.  When wetlands are altered or destroyed, mitigation must be provided to recreate the functions and values of the lost wetland, in accordance with the wetland replacement plan requirements outlined in subsection 21670.11 of this Chapter.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2011-05, 02/22/11) 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2011-22, 07/26/11) 
 
 
21670.02. PURPOSE AND IMPLEMENTATION: 
 
 Subd. 1. Through the adoption and enforcement of this Section, the City shall promote the general health, safety, and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management practices and mitigation as provided for in the WCA when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands.  Through the implementation of this Section, the City seeks to accomplish the following purposes: 
  
 (a) To satisfy the requirements of the WCA as it may be amended and, thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the City;  
 
 (b) To balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the City; 
 
 (c) To preserve the natural character of the landscape through the maintenance of wetland ecosystems; 
 
 (d) To promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water, to retain sediment and toxicants and filter and strip nutrients from surface water runoff  before it discharges into community lakes and streams, thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features; and 
 
 (e) To provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the City. 
 
 Subd. 2. To accomplish these purposes, the City will: 
 
 (a) Maintain an inventory of all wetlands within the City; 
 
 (b) Maintain a system of classification for wetlands within the City and classify the City's wetlands based upon their relative values related to floral diversity, wildlife habitat, water quality protection, fishery habitat, flood storage, shoreline protection, and aesthetic, recreational and education benefits. 
 
 (c) Prepare and maintain a comprehensive set of official maps identifying the location and classification of all wetlands within the City. 
 
 (d) Establish wetland regulations that are coordinated with flood plain and shoreland protection regulations.  
 
 (e) Require sound management practices to protect, conserve, maintain, enhance, and improve the quality of wetlands within the community. 
 
 (f) Enforce standards for the alteration of wetlands when alteration is allowed, including standards and procedures for the mitigation of the loss of wetland areas and their functions and values, when alteration or destruction occurs. 
 
 (g) Obtain protective easements over or acquire fee title to wetlands as appropriate. 
 
 (h) Develop and maintain a program to educate the public about the numerous benefits and features that wetlands provide and the adverse effects of improperly managed urban development on wetlands. 
 
 (Amended by Ord. No. 2010-01, 02/23/10) 
 
 
21670.03. GENERAL PROVISIONS: 
 
 Subd. 1. Identification and Delineation of Wetlands.   
 
 (a) This Section shall apply to all land containing wetlands and land within the buffer strip and setback areas required by this Section.  Wetlands shall be subject to the requirements established herein, as well as restrictions and requirements established by other applicable Federal, State, and City ordinances and regulations.  These wetland protection regulations shall not be construed to allow anything otherwise prohibited in the zoning district where the wetland area is located. 
 
 (b) A wetland is land that meets the definition of "wetlands" as set forth in Section 21005 of this Chapter.  Wetlands shall be determined according to the United States Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (January 1987) and regional supplements if available.  Wetlands have been or will be identified and the wetland classification as established by the officially adopted City maps shall be prima facie evidence of the location and classification of a wetland.  The official maps shall be developed and maintained by the Community Development Department and are open to inspection by the public.  The presence or absence of a wetland on the official maps does 
not represent a definitive determination as to whether a wetland covered by this Section is or is not present.  Wetlands that are identified during site specific delineation activities but do not appear on the official wetland maps are still subject to the provisions of this Section.  It will be the responsibility of an applicant to delineate the exact wetland boundary or to determine that no wetland exists on a subject property.  All delineations must be reviewed and approved by the City.  Submission of a wetland delineation report shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the City Code.  If an applicant questions whether a wetland exists or disputes its classification, the applicant shall have the burden to supply detailed information for review supporting the applicant’s assertion, including but not limited to, topographic, hydrologic, floristic and soil data deemed necessary by the City to determine the jurisdictional status of the wetland, its exact boundary and its classification.  Submission of a request for a reclassification of the wetland quality shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the City Code.  Wetland delineations supplied by applicants shall be certified by a qualified wetland delineator.  Wetland delineators must satisfy any certification requirements that may be established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2010-01, 02/23/10)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2011-05, 02/22/11) 
  
(c) Only that portion of a property within the boundaries of a wetland and its required buffer strip and setback shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. 
 
(d) This Section establishes four wetland classifications as defined in Section 21005 of this Chapter; Exceptional Quality, High Quality, Medium Quality, and Low Quality. 
 
(Amended by Ord. No. 2011-22, 07/26/11) 
 
 
21670.04. GENERAL STANDARDS:  The following standards apply to all lands containing or abutting a wetland: 
 
 Subd. 1. Septic and soil absorption systems must be set back a minimum of 75 feet from the City approved boundary of the wetland. 
 
 Subd. 2. The lowest ground floor elevation shall be two feet above the 100-Year flood elevation or three feet above the Ordinary High Water Mark of public waters regulated by Section 21665 of this Chapter, whichever is greater. 
 
 Subd. 3. Structures intended to provide access across a wetland shall be prohibited unless a permit is obtained in conformance with State Regulations. 
 
 Subd. 4. The MPCA's Best Management Practices and Minnesota Storm Water Manual, as applicable, shall be followed to avoid erosion and sedimentation during the construction process. 
 
 Subd. 5. City inspection schedules and fines for erosion control will double on projects abutting wetlands. 
 
 Subd. 6. Before the City issues a building permit for a lot with a required wetland buffer strip, the lot owner shall install the wetland buffer monumentation required by Section 21670.07 of this Chapter.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2016-11, 04/26/16) 
 
 Subd. 7. Wetlands and their required buffer strips, as required by Section 21670.05, must be kept free of all structures and features, including fences and play equipment. 
 
 Subd. 8. Wetlands and their required buffer strips, as required by Section 21670.05, shall not be used for outside storage of household or personal items, lawn equipment, furniture, firewood, parts, yard waste, and the like. 
 
 Subd. 9. In cases where a site is not subject to the wetland buffer strips and setbacks required by Section 21670.05, buildings, swimming pools, patios, decks, retaining walls, drive aisles, and parking lots shall be set back not less than 15 feet from a wetland edge.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2004-02, 01/13/04)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2009-07, 05/12/09)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2012-05, 02/28/12)

Except for removal of noxious weeds and nuisance or dead vegetation, wetland buffer strips shall not be disturbed, cut (mowed) or cultivated, without prior approval of a buffer restoration / management plan by the City Engineer.  Buffer strips shall be located within a drainage and utility easement, and shall be identified within each lot by permanent monumentation approved by the City.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2016-11, 04/26/16)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2019-01, 02/12/19) 
 
 Subd. 4. For roadways that must be aligned either adjacent to or across wetlands and are subject to WCA replacement requirements, additional wetland filling to create a buffer strip shall not be required.  Trails that are intended to serve an interpretive function may also be exempted from the buffer strip requirement.  All other roadways and trails shall meet the buffer strip standards established by this Section.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2001-06, 02/13/01)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2011-05, 02/22/11) 
 
 Subd. 5. If the area of the buffer strip has a preconstruction slope of 12 percent or greater, the buffer strip shall be at the applicable maximum width for the wetland classification.  The use of a meandering buffer strip to maintain a natural appearance is encouraged but not required in areas of flat topography. 
 
 Subd. 6. The required structure setback shall apply to all structures except those identified in Section 21670.055 and roadways, driveways, parking lots, trails, and their related retaining walls and fences.  (Amended by Ord. No. 2001-06, 02/13/01)  (Amended by Ord. No. 2012-05, 02/28/12)

(b) has an overstory of trees or shrubs with at least 80 percent canopy closure that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least five consecutive years, or 
 
(c) contains a mixture of the plant communities described in (a) and (b) above, that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least five consecutive years. 
 
 Subd. 2. Notwithstanding the performance standards outlined in Subd. 1 above, the City may determine existing buffer strip vegetation to be unacceptable if; 
 
(a) it is composed of undesirable plant species (including but not limited to reed canary grass, common buckthorn, purple loosestrife, leafy spurge or noxious weeds), or 
 
(b) it is lacking a layer of organic thatch or duff, or 
 
(c) has topography that tends to channelize the flow of surface runoff, or 
 
(d) for some other reason it is unlikely to retain nutrients and sediment. 
 
 Subd. 3. Where buffer strip areas, or a portion thereof, are not vegetated or have been cultivated or otherwise disturbed within five years of the permit application, such areas shall be re-planted and maintained according to each of the following standards: 
 
(a) The soil in wetland buffer strips shall be amended, as necessary, to ensure that the soil has an organic content of not less than 10 percent and not more than 35 percent. 


 
(b) Buffer strips shall be planted with a Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) approved seed mix containing 100 percent perennial native plant species, except for a one-time planting of an annual nurse or cover crop such as oats or rye.
