PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of 
Eastpointe, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code of Ordinances, as 
supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is 
included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note 
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use 
of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1989 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Karen 
Kopetskie, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to 
the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Robert J. Hribar, City Attorney, for his cooperation and 
assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the 
publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily 
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's 
affairs.

ordinance reducing appropriations, the levy of a lower rate be made possible; but no such amendment 
shall reduce the appropriations made on account of City debt as recommended by the Manager in 
accordance with subdivision 5 and 6 of Section 6 of this chapter. If the Council determines by reduction of 
its appropriations to provide for a lower rate of tax levy the Manager shall, upon the passage of the

1½ percent unless the question of levying a higher rate for a specified year or years shall have been 
submitted to the electors of the City and approved by a majority of those voting thereon; but in no case 
shall such tax levy be more than 2 percent. The Council shall provide for an annual levy to be raised by 
taxes upon real and personal property for public safety purposes of 7/10 percent, subject to the 2 percent 
limitation contained herein for general fund public services. The tax limits provided by this section shall 
apply only to taxes levied for purposes other than to provide for paying the interest and principal of the

of the current year, in furtherance of improvements or other objects or works which will not be completed 
within such year, and any such appropriation shall continue in force until the purpose for which it was 
made shall have been accomplished or abandoned.

and shall issue no warrant for payment unless he finds that the claim is in proper form, correctly 
computed and duly approved; that it is legally due and payable; that an appropriation has been made 
therefor which has not been exhausted; and that there is money in the treasury to make payment. He 
may investigate a claim and for that purpose may summon before him any officer, agent or employee of 
the City, any claimant or other person, and examine him upon oath or affirmation relative thereto, and if 
he find a claim to be fraudulent, erroneous or otherwise invalid, he shall not issue a warrant therefor. If

chargeable, sufficient to meet the obligation entailed by said contract, agreement, order or other 
document.

Sec. 1. - Board of special assessors. 
    There shall be a Board of Special Assessors consisting of the City Assessor, City Treasurer and City 
Manager, whose duty it shall be to make special assessments authorized by this Charter. All the clerical 
work of such board shall be performed by the Assessor. No compensation in addition to their regular 
salaries shall be paid to the members of said Board of Special Assessors for the services performed on 
said board. 


Sec. 2. - Special benefits. 
    The Council shall have power to provide for the payment of all or any part of the cost of a public 
improvement by the levying and collecting of special assessments upon property specially benefited. The 
cost of surveys and plans for a public improvement and all expenses incident to the proceedings for the 
making of such improvement and the special assessment therefor, shall be deemed to be a part of the 
cost therefor. The term "public improvement" as herein used shall include the repair and reconstruction of 
any structure or work as well as the original construction thereof. Provided, however, that where the cost 
of any pavement shall have been paid for in whole or in part by special assessment, then the cost of 
repairing such pavement and of reconstructing the same to the width of the original pavement, shall be 
borne by the City at large. 


Sec. 3. - Resolution of council. 
    When the Council shall determine to make any public improvement and defray the whole or any part 
of the cost thereof, by special assessment, they shall so declare by resolution, stating the nature of the 
improvement and what part or proportion of the cost thereof shall be paid by special assessment, and 
what part, if any, shall be paid from the general funds of the City, and shall designate the district or lands 
and premises upon which the special assessment shall be levied. 


Sec. 4. - Estimates of cost. 
    Before ordering any public improvement, any part of the cost of which is to be defrayed by special 
assessment, the Council shall cause estimates of the cost thereof to be made, and also plans, when 
practicable, of the work and of the locality to be improved, and deposit the same with the Clerk for public 
examination; and they shall give notice thereof and of the proposed improvement and of the district to be 
assessed, and of the time and place when the Council will meet and consider any objections thereto, by 
publication twice prior to such meeting in a newspaper circulating in the City, the first publication to be at 
least one week prior to such meeting. 


Sec. 5. - Designation of district. 
    When any special assessment is to be made upon the lands and premises in any special 
assessment district, according to frontage or benefits, the Council shall, by resolution, direct the same to 
be made by the Board of Special Assessors and shall state therein the amount to be assessed and 
whether according to frontage or benefit; and describe or designate an assessment district comprising the 
lands and premises to be assessed. 


Sec. 6. - Special assessment roll. 
    Upon receiving such orders and direction, the Board of Special Assessors shall make out an 
assessment roll, entering and describing therein all the lots and parcels of land to be assessed, with the 
names of the respective owners thereof, and shall levy thereon and against such property the amount to 
be assessed, in the manner directed by the Council and the provisions of this Charter applicable to the 
assessment. In all cases where the ownership of any description is unknown to the Board of Special 
Assessors, they shall, in lieu of the name of the owner, insert the word "Unknown" and if by mistake or 
otherwise, any person shall be improperly designated as the owner of any lot or parcel of land, or if the 
same shall be assessed without the name of the owner, or with the name of a person other than the 
owner, such assessment shall not for such causes be vitiated, but shall, in all respects, be as valid upon 
and against such lot or parcel of land as though assessed in the name of the proper owner. When the 
assessment shall have been confirmed, it shall be a lien on each such lot or parcel of land and shall be 
collected as in this Charter provided. 


Sec. 7. - Assessment by benefits. 
    If the assessment is required to be according to frontage, the Board of Special Assessors shall 
assess to each lot or parcel of land such relative portion of the whole amount to be levied, as the length of 
the frontage of such premises bears to the whole frontage of all lots and parcels of land to be assessed 
unless on account of the shape or size of any lot or parcel of land an assessment for a different number 
of feet would be more equitable. If the assessment is directed to be according to benefits, they shall 
assess upon each lot or parcel of land, such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied as shall be 
proportionate to the estimated benefit resulting to such lot or parcel of land from the improvement. The 
word frontage as used in this chapter shall be construed to mean that part of a lot or parcel of land which 
directly abuts upon the street or alley, improved or to be improved, or in which the improvement is located 
or is to be located.

Sec. 9. - Expense by special benefits. 
    When any expense shall be incurred by the City upon or in respect to any separate or single lot or 
parcel of land which, by the provisions of this Charter, the Council is authorized to charge and collect as a 
special assessment against the same, and not being that class of special assessments required to be 
made pro rata upon several lots or parcels of land in a special assessment district, an account of the 
labor, material or services for which such expense was incurred, verified by the Manager, with a 
description of the premises upon or in respect to which the expense was incurred, and the name of the 
owner, or person chargeable therewith, if known, shall be reported to the Council in such manner as they 
shall prescribe. The provisions of the preceding sections of this chapter with reference to special 
assessment generally, and the proceedings necessary to be had before making the improvements, shall 
not apply to assessments to cover the expense incurred in respect to that class of improvements 
contemplated in this section. 


Sec. 10. - Council to determine charges. 
    The Council shall determine what amount or part of every such expense shall be charged, and the 
person, if known, against whom, and the premises upon which the same shall be levied as a special 
assessment, and as often as the Council shall deem it expedient they shall require all of the several 
amounts so reported and determined, and the several lots or parcels of land, and the persons chargeable 
therewith, respectively, to be reported by the Clerk to the Board of Special Assessors for assessment. 


Sec. 11. - Special assessment roll. 
    Upon receiving the report mentioned in the preceding section, the Board of Special Assessors shall 
make a special assessment roll, and levy as a special assessment therein, upon each lot or parcel of land 
so reported to them and against the persons chargeable therewith, if known, the whole amount or 
amounts of all the charges so directed as aforesaid to be levied upon each of such lots or parcels of land 
respectively, together with an overhead charge not exceeding ten per centum, and when completed they 
shall report the assessment to the Council and thereupon the same proceedings shall be had and with 
like effect as is provided in this chapter for special assessments in other cases, except that the Council 
may require that the same be paid in one or any other number of installments not to exceed the longest 
period provided by Section 16 of this chapter; provided that notice of the filing of the special assessment 
roll in such cases and of the reviewing of the same, may be given by sending such notice by first-class 
mail to the persons named in such roll at their last known addresses, respectively, instead of giving such 
notice by publication. If such notice is given by publication, the Council may order the cost thereof to be 
added to the roll and distributed pro rata according to the amounts of the several assessments therein.

Sec. 12. - Roll to be filed. 
    When any special assessment roll shall be reported by the Board of Special Assessors to the

consecutively. Before confirming such assessment roll, the Council shall appoint a time when the Council 
and Board of Special Assessors will meet and review such assessment and shall cause a notice of such 
hearing and of the filing of such assessment roll, to be published twice prior to such hearing, in a

Sec. 13. - Meeting of board of special assessors. 
    At the time and place appointed for the purpose as aforesaid, the Council and Board of Special 
Assessors shall meet and then and there, or at some adjourned meeting, review the assessment roll, and

aggrieved thereby, and the Council may correct said roll as to any assessment, description or premises, 
or other matter appearing therein, and may confirm it as reported or as connected, or they may refer the 
assessment roll back to the Board of Special Assessors for revision, or they may annual it and direct a 
new assessment, in which case the same proceedings shall be held as in respect to the previous 
assessment. When a special assessment shall be confirmed, the Clerk shall make an endorsement upon 
the roll showing the date of the confirmation. 
State Law reference Notice of hearings, MCL 211.741 et seq. 


Sec. 14. - Confirmation of roll. 
    When any assessment roll shall be confirmed by the Council, it shall be final and conclusive. 


Sec. 15. - Lien of assessment. 
    All special assessments, including deferred payments, shall from the date of confirmation thereof, 
constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land assessed, and until paid shall be a charge

Sec. 16. - Installments and interest. 
    Special assessments to defray in whole or in part the cost of installing or constructing any public 
improvement for which a special assessment has been levied shall be payable in not more than ten (10) 
approximately equal annual installments, as the City Council shall determine, except that where special 
assessment is levied to defray in whole or in part the cost of constructing a pavement such special 
assessment roll may be divided into not more than fifteen (15) approximately equal annual installments, 
and where the assessment roll is levied to defray in whole or in part the cost of constructing any sewer or 
drain the assessment roll may be divided into not more than thirty (30) approximately equal annual 
installments provided that no assessment roll shall be divided into more than ten (10) approximately equal 
annual installments unless a petition shall be filed with the City Council, prior to confirmation of the 
special assessment roll, signed by persons who shall be required to pay at least 10 per centum of the 
amount assessed to private property on such roll, requesting the division of the special assessment roll in 
such greater number of parts, and provided further, that no assessment roll shall be divided into such 
number of installments as shall mature in a period in excess of the period of usefulness of the 
improvement, as shall be determined by the City Council. The first installment of any special assessment 
shall be due and paid within sixty (60) days after the date of the sale of the bonds issued to finance the 
cost of such special assessment where such bonds are sold, and in all other cases within sixty (60) days 
after the date of the confirmation of the special assessment roll, and one installment shall be due and 
payable one year thereafter upon the same day of the year as that upon which the roll was confirmed, or 
upon which the bonds were sold, together with annual interest upon all unpaid installments, as shall be 
fixed by the City Council, at a rate not exceeding six (6) per centum per annum, provided that no interest 
shall be charged until sixty (60) days after the first installment shall become due, as above provided. The 
whole assessment chargeable against any lot or parcel of land may be paid to the City Treasurer at any 
time in full with accrued interest and penalties thereon. If any special assessment or any installment of 
any special assessment is not paid when due, then such assessment or installment shall be deemed to 
be delinquent, and there shall be collected, thereon, in addition to the interest, a penalty at the rate of 
one-half (½) of one (1) percent for each month or fraction thereof, that the same remains unpaid, before 
being reported to the City Council for the purpose of being reassessed upon the City Tax Roll. 


Sec. 17. - Council may re-assess. 
    In all cases of special assessments of any kind against any property where any such assessments 
have failed to be valid in whole or in part, the Council shall be and they are hereby authorized to cause to 
be reassessed such special taxes or assessments, and to enforce their collection; and it is further 
provided that whenever for any cause, mistake, or inadvertence, the amount assessed shall not be 
sufficient to pay that portion of the cost of the improvement which the Council has determined should be 
assessed against the property or the owners of property in the local assessment district, that it shall be 
lawful, and the Council is hereby directed and authorized to cause to be made a reassessment upon all 
the property in such local assessment district to pay for such improvement and to continue requiring such 
reassessment until a valid and sufficient assessment shall have been made. 


Sec. 18. - Equitable lien. 
    No judgment or decree, nor any act of Council vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair 
the lien of the City upon the premises assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably 
charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might have been lawfully assessed 
thereon. 


Sec. 19. - Special assessment roll. 
    When any special assessment shall be confirmed, the Council shall direct the assessment so made 
in the special assessment roll to be collected. The City Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the City Treasurer 
said special assessment roll to which he shall attach his warrant commanding the City Treasurer to collect 
from each of the persons assessed in said roll the amount of money assessed to and set opposite his 
name therein, and in case any person named in said roll shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment, or 
any part thereof, upon demand, after the same has become due, then to levy and collect the same by 
distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such person. Said warrant shall require the City Treasurer, 
on the first day of May following the date when such assessment, or any part thereof, has become 
delinquent, to submit to the Council a sworn statement of all assessments or parts thereof in said roll 
which have become delinquent and are unpaid, which shall include a list of persons delinquent, if known, 
a description of the lots and parcels of land upon which the assessments remain unpaid, and the amount 
unpaid on each inclusive of accrued interest and penalty. 


Sec. 20. - Sale at public auction. 
    Upon receiving said special assessment roll and warrant the Treasurer shall proceed to collect the 
amount assessed therein. If any person shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment upon demand, the 
Treasurer shall seize and levy upon any personal property found within the City or elsewhere within the 
State of Michigan, belonging to such person and sell the same at public auction, first giving six days 
notice of the time and place of such sale, by posting such notice in three public places in the City or 
township where such property may be found. The proceeds of such sale, or so much thereof as may be 
necessary for that purpose, shall be applied to the payment of the assessment, the costs and expenses 
of seizure and sale, and the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the person entitled thereto. 


Sec. 21. - Delinquent assessments. 
    In case any assessment, or any part thereof shall remain unpaid on the first of May following the 
date when the same became delinquent, shall be reported unpaid by the Treasurer to the Council as 
aforesaid, the same shall be transferred and reassessed upon the next State and County Roll in a column 
headed "Special Assessment" and when so transferred and reassessed upon said tax roll, shall be 
collected and paid in all respects as provided for the collection of City Taxes. 
    In case any such reassessment shall remain unpaid by the following March first, the same, with all 
accrued interest and penalty shall be returned to the Macomb County Treasurer with an additional five 
percent (5%) penalty. 
(Amended 11-4-1930) 


Sec. 22. - Collection by suit. 
    At any time after a special assessment has become payable, the same may be collected by suit, in 
the name of the City, against the person assessed, in an action of assumpsit, in any court having 
jurisdiction of the amount. In every such action a declaration upon the common counts for money paid 
shall be sufficient. The special assessment roll and a certified order or resolution confirming the same 
shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity of all the proceedings in making the assessment of the 
whole amount due, and of the right of the City to recover judgment therefor. 


Sec. 23. - Irregularities in assessments. 
    If, in any such action, it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities, the 
assessment has not been properly made against the Defendant, or upon the premises sought to be 
charged, the court may nevertheless on satisfactory proof that expenses have been incurred by the City, 
which is a proper charge against the Defendant, or the premises in question, render judgment for the 
amount properly chargeable against such defendant, or upon such premises. 


Sec. 24. - Snow and ice assessments. 
    If the owner or occupant of any lot or premises shall fail to remove the snow, ice, or filth from the 
sidewalk upon which such property abuts, or to remove and keep the same from obstruction, 
encroachments, encumbrances or other nuisances, or fail to perform any other duty required by the City 
in respect to such sidewalks or the premises within such time and in such manner as the City shall 
require, the City may cause the same to be done, and the expenses or such part thereof as the City shall 
have determined, together with a penalty of ten percentum may be charged and collected as a special 
assessment against such property, as in this Charter provided. 


Sec. 25. - Surplus. 
    Moneys raised by special assessment to pay for the cost of any local improvement shall be held as a 
special fund to pay such cost or to repay money borrowed therefor. If there shall be a surplus in such 
fund, such surplus shall be refunded pro rata as soon as such surplus shall have been ascertained, and 
such refund shall be made by crediting to the first installments of the special assessment falling due to the 
extent that the various parcels assessed in the assessment roll are entitled to such refund. 


Sec. 26. - Division of improvements. 
    The City Council may divide any improvement into parts or sections and provide for separate 
construction of such parts or sections and may establish a separate special assessment district for each 
part or section and may issue bonds against such separate district. 


Sec. 27. - Advertise for bids. 
    No improvement, any part of the cost of which is to be assessed to a special assessment district, 
shall be made until the Council has first advertised for proposals for making such improvement, and 
received and opened the same. The Council may reject any and all of such proposals and may in their 
discretion make such improvement by the proper officers and agents of the City, provided that the City 
shall make such improvement at a cost not in excess of the bid of the lowest responsible bidder. 


Sec. 28. - Division of lots, assessments. 
    Should any lot or parcel of land be divided after a special assessment thereon has been confirmed 
and before the collection of all the installments, the Council may require the Board of Special Assessors 
to apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several parts of such lot and parcel of land so divided. The 
report of such apportionment, when confirmed, shall be conclusive upon all the parties and all 
assessments thereafter made upon such lots shall be according to such division. 


Sec. 29. - City's portion. 
    Whenever any improvement is to be paid for in part by a special assessment district and in part by 
the City at large, the Council may provide for the payment of the City's portion in installments in the same 
manner as assessments against private property, and may issue bonds against the unpaid portion thereof 
in the same manner as is provided in this Charter for the issuance of bonds against the unpaid portion of 
assessments against private property. Bonds against the City's portion of the cost of any such 
improvement shall be a general liability of the City. 


Sec. 30. - Revision of assessment roll. 
    Where a special assessment has been heretofore levied to pay for the cost of installing any local 
improvement, and the number of installments into which such special assessment has been levied is less 
in number than the maximum number of installments into which a special assessment roll may be divided 
in accordance with the provisions of this Charter, the City Council may, upon petition of property owners 
chargeable with such special assessment to a number not less than ten percentum of assessable 
property in such special assessment district, revise such special assessment roll in a manner so as to 
increase the number of installments into which such special assessment roll shall be divided, providing 
that such revised roll shall not be divided into more installments than the maximum permitted under the 
provisions of this Charter for the particular type of improvement for which the assessment was originally 
levied, and provided that the revised assessment roll shall not exceed in total the original assessment roll 
except that any additional cost incurred by reason of refinancing may be added to the revised special 
assessment roll and made a part of the cost of the improvement assessable to the property benefited. 


Sec. 31. - Refunding bonds. 
    If the City Council shall undertake, as hereinbefore set forth, to revise any special assessment roll 
heretofore confirmed, by increasing the number of installments into which such special assessment roll 
shall have been divided, the City Council may issue refunding special assessment bonds in an amount 
not to exceed the revised special assessment roll, and may apportion the bonds against the amount of 
the several installments of the revised special assessment roll as the Council may determine, and such 
bonds shall severally be payable in two years or less from the time fixed for collection of the several 
installments of the revised special assessment roll as shall be determined by the City Council and the 
proceeds from the issuance of such refunding special assessment bonds shall be used for the sole 
purpose of refunding and payment of special assessment bonds heretofore issued to finance the cost of 
the improvement for which the original assessment roll was created, and such refunding special 
assessment bonds may be issued upon proper resolution by the City Council after determination to revise 
any such special assessment roll and after hearing and confirmation of such revised special assessment 
roll, in accordance with the proceedings of this Charter in relation to confirmation of special assessment 
rolls in general. Such bonds shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding six (6) percent per annum, and 
shall be primarily payable out of collection of the special assessment in anticipation of the collection of 
which such bonds are issued, and in the issuance thereof the City Council shall pledge the full faith and 
credit of the City for the prompt payment of such bonds, both principal and interest, and in the event of 
any deficiency in any special assessment fund, thereupon payment of such bonds, both principal and 
interest, shall be provided out of the general funds of the City, to be reimbursed upon collection of such 
special assessment. 


Sec. 32. - Exchange of bonds. 
    Whenever the City Council shall determine to revise any special assessment roll, as hereinbefore set 
forth, it may, upon issuance of the refunding bonds, proceed to exchange and take up and cancel the 
outstanding special assessment bonds heretofore issued, and for the refinancing of which such refunding 
bonds have been issued, provided that the exchange thereof shall be upon a basis of the par value of the 
outstanding special assessment bonds, together with accrued interest, and if it shall be impossible to 
make such exchange, the City Council may proceed to sell such refunding special assessment bonds and 
use the proceeds thereof for the payment of the special assessment bonds heretofore issued, and to 
refinance which the refunding bonds have been issued, and for no other purpose. 


Sec. 33. - Credit for payments. 
    Whenever any special assessment roll shall be revised, as herebefore set forth, and any person 
shall have paid any or all of the installments of the original special assessment roll, such person shall be 
entitled to credit upon the revised special assessment roll to the extent of payments so made, and it shall 
be the duty of the City Treasurer to credit such payments so made upon the revised special assessment 
roll upon delivery to him thereof.

of collective bargaining, which changes have then been adopted by resolution of council. The provisions 
of this chapter XVIII, as amended by such resolutions, have been codified in 2-273 et seq. of the Code of 
Ordinances. Reference should be made to such chapter for a final and definitive statement of the law in 
this area.

supplemental to Social Security benefits; providing for contributions to a retirement system by the 
members and the City; and providing for the administration of a retirement system by the members and 
the City. Benefits heretofore accrued in the City's retirement system under this Chapter 18 shall not be 
diminished or impaired.

____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody 
the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5) ?Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance 
sections inserted in the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning

Sec. 2-97. - Preamble. 
    Public office and employment are public trusts and each public official and employee must endeavor 
to earn and honor the public trust in the performance of all official duties and actions. Public officials and 
employees are chargeable with honesty, integrity, and openness in their handling of public affairs. When 
conduct inconsistent with these expectations occurs, public suspicion is heightened and public confidence 
is jeopardized. The city hereby declares all city officials and employees, elected or appointed, paid or 
unpaid, must avoid any and all conflicts between their private interests and the public interest. The 
purpose of this division is to define standards of ethical conduct that are clearly established and uniformly 
applied. These standards will provide the public, as well as public officials and employees, with guidance 
about ethical expectations for trustees of the public. 
(Ord. No. 1057, 12-20-2011) 


Sec. 2-98. - Policy.

principles: 
(1) ?Public interest. The power and resources of government service shall be used only to advance 
the public interest. 
(2) ?Objective judgment. Loyalty to the public interest requires that all matters shall be decided with 
independent, objective judgment, free from avoidable conflicts of interest, improper influences 
and competing loyalties. 
(3) ?Accountability . Government affairs shall be conducted in an open, efficient, fair and honorable 
manner, which enables citizens to make informed judgments and hold officials and employees 
accountable. 
(4) ?Democratic leadership. All city officials and employees shall honor and respect the spirit and 
principles of representative democracy and uphold the Constitution of the United States and the 
constitution of the state and carry out and comply with the laws of the nation, state and the city. 
(5) ?Respectfulness . All city officials and employees shall safeguard public confidence by being 
honest, fair, impartial, and respectful toward all persons and property with whom they have 
contact in an official capacity and by avoiding conduct which may tend to undermine respect for 
city officials and for the city as an institution.

    Any employee of a contractor or grantee who believes the contractor or grantee has failed to comply 
with this division shall file a notice with the city manager or his or her designee, who shall promptly serve 
it on the contractor or grantee. The city manager or his or her designee shall notify the contractor or 
grantee to submit proof of compliance within 30 days or it shall be grounds for termination of the contract 
or grant. The city manager or his or her designee shall have 60 days to investigate and remedy the 
complaint. This division shall not be construed to limit an employee's right to bring legal action for 
violation of any other minimum compensation or wage and hour law. 
(Code 1989, § 213.05; Ord. No. 901, 4-3-2001) 


Sec. 2-577. - Noncompliance. 
    In the event the city manager or his or her designee determines the contractor or grantee has failed 
to comply with the provisions of this division, the failure to rectify the noncompliance within 30 days shall 
be grounds for the termination of a contract or grant. A contractor or grantee who violates the living wage 
requirement shall pay to each employee affected the amount of deficiency, for each day the violation 
continues. Willful violation of this division will result in a penalty paid to the city in the amount of $50.00 
per violation for each day the violation continues. The city may withhold from contract payments, grants or 
financial assistance such amounts as are necessary to effectuate the payments provided in this section. 
(Code 1989, § 213.06; Ord. No. 901, 4-3-2001)

for exercising any rights under this division, including but not limited to the filing of a complaint. Any 
employer who is found to have violated section 2-574 shall have its contract or grant terminated 
immediately and such employer shall be barred from bidding on or entering into any contracts with the

Sec. 2-613. - Findings of fact. 
    The city finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic accidents in the city involve drivers 
who were operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled 
substance. In addition, the city finds that in traffic accidents involving drivers who were operating a motor 
vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance, there is a greater 
likelihood of personal injury and property damage. In addition, the city finds that because of the foregoing 
factors, a greater operational and/or financial burden is placed upon the city police and fire departments 
and rescue services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic 
liquors and/or a controlled substance.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings 
ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Deliberately caused fire means a fire purposely caused by a person which presents a direct and 
immediate threat to public safety and requires immediate action to mitigate the threat. 
    Expenses means the actual labor costs to the city and its personnel, including workers' 
compensation benefits, fringe benefits, administrative overhead, costs of equipment, costs of equipment 
operation, costs of materials, costs of disposal, costs of any contract labor and materials and those costs 
associated with incident abatement, mitigation and clean up in order to ensure the safety of the city and 
its populace. 
    Hazardous/toxic materials emergencies means a sudden and unexpected release or threat of 
release of any substance that, because of its quantity, concentration or physical, chemical, or infectious 
characteristics, presents a direct and immediate threat to the public health or safety or the environment, 
and that requires immediate action to mitigate the threat. 
    Negligently caused fire means a fire proximately caused by the negligence of an owner or occupier 
of property and/or structures, or by any other person, which fire presents a direct and immediate threat to 
the public safety and requires immediate action to mitigate the threat.

DIVISION 6. - ACCIDENT COST RECOVERY 


Sec. 2-665. - Findings of fact. 
    The city finds that the city police and fire departments and rescue services' response to motor 
vehicle accidents continues to increase in cost each year and create increased demands on all 
operational areas of such services. In addition, a significant number of traffic accidents in the city are 
caused by drivers who do not own property or pay property taxes in the city. In addition, the city finds that 
because of the foregoing factors, a greater operational and/or financial burden is placed upon the city 
police and fire departments and rescue services. In addition, raising the real property tax to meet the 
increase in service demands would be unfair to the property owners, when an increasing number of the 
motor vehicular accidents are caused by individuals not owning property or paying property taxes in the 
city; and the ability of the city police and fire departments and rescue services to effectively respond 
decreases the liability of the insurance companies by saving lives and minimizing vehicular damage by 
fire. 
(Ord. No. 1024, § 211.01, 6-15-2010) 


Sec. 2-666. - Service fees. 
    The city police and city fire departments and rescue services shall initiate services fees for the 
delivery of services, personnel, supplies and equipment to the scene of motor vehicle accidents. The rate 
of the service fees shall be that which is the usual, customary and reasonable costs, which includes any 
services, personnel, supplies and equipment, and may vary based on the actual costs of the individual 
accident. 
(Ord. No. 1024, § 211.02, 6-15-2010)

vehicle insurance, representing an add-on cost of the claim for negligent driving damages of the vehicles, 
property and/or injuries. The claim costs shall be filed with the insurance company, the owner of a

and charges so that wastewater system rates and charges are sufficient to cover the 
operation and maintenance costs of the wastewater system. 
c. ?The director of the department of water and sewers, based upon the costs of the prior year 
and the anticipated costs for the ensuing year, shall annually recommend a separate 
budget for each system to the council. If the costs of the prior year or the recommended

system, the council shall adjust the rates and charges for the system to eliminate the 
deficiency. The rates and charges shall be in relation to the costs incurred to provide 
services to each user. 
(2) ?Reserve fund. Out of the revenues remaining in the receiving fund after provision has been 
made for the operation and maintenance fund, there shall be established and maintained a 
separate account designated the "reserve fund." Funds deposited in the reserve fund shall be 
transferred to the operation and maintenance fund in ensuing years to offset increased costs for 
operation and administration of the department.

(b) ?Application. The owner of any dog that is four months old or older shall apply to the city clerk's office

for the dog provided the owner complies the following requirements: 
a. ?Applies for a dog license as required; 
b. ?Pays all required fees as set by the city council; 
c. ?Submits a written statement signed by a licensed veterinarian affirming the dog is allergic 
to the vaccination shot and that the vaccination will have an adverse health impact on the 
dog; 
d. ?Provides an annual update signed by a licensed veterinarian that the administration of the 
rabies vaccination was re-evaluated and that the dog is allergic and the vaccination will 
have an adverse health impact on the dog; 
e. ?Submits a signed affidavit affirming "As the owner of an unvaccinated dog, I am aware of 
the risk of owning such unvaccinated dog and recognize the potential for court-ordered 
euthanasia and/or quarantine of the dog should it bite or otherwise expose a human to 
rabies"; 
f. ?Agrees to notify the city clerk's office if the dog is destroyed or moved from the city; 
g. ?Agrees that the unvaccinated dog must be muzzled and restrained by a suitable leash and

audibly impaired person, a service dog for a physically limited person, or governmental police or 
fire dogs are not subject to any fee for licensing. 
(2) ?In the event a dog's breed and size prohibit the rabies vaccination prior to or at four months of 
age, the additional fee will not be charged for the license if the owner complies with both 
requirements as follows: 
a. ?Submits a written statement signed by a licensed veterinarian affirming that the dog could 
not receive a rabies vaccination due to its breed and size until "date specified"; and 
b. ?Application for license is received within 30 days from the date the dog was able to be 
vaccinated. 
(3) ?If a dog is licensed before it becomes five months old and cannot be spayed or neutered 
because of its size or breed, and with submission of a written statement signed by a licensed 
veterinarian affirming such, a one-year puppy license shall be issued at a fee as adopted by the 
city council from time to time. 
(4) ?The city supports responsible pet ownership for owners and basic good manners for dogs. In 
an effort to ensure all dogs become properly integrated with the community, the city may 
approve a dog ownership program that will educate owners and familiarize them with all 
applicable ordinances and the enforcement of such in the community. To encourage attendance 
in this program and in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, a waiver of the dog 
license fee shall be granted the first license application received after proof of completion of the 
city-approved program. One license fee waiver is permitted per dog. 
(e) ?Tags; license fees. Upon acceptance of the license application and compliance with all relevant 
requirements of this chapter by the city clerk's office, the city treasurer shall deliver to the applicant a 
dog tag duly stamped and engraved as may be determined by the city and shall collect sums in an 
amount as adopted by the city council from time to time for each spayed/neutered dog, each 
nonspayed/nonneutered dog, each show dog and each puppy. Applicants for a show dog license 
must present proof as required by the city clerk's office that such dog is a show dog, as that term is 
defined in section 8-8(b). However, in the event the application is filed and the license is issued 
subsequent to March 1, there shall be an additional fee, in an amount as adopted by the city council 
from time to time, if such dog was four months old or over on March 1 prior thereto. In the event such 
dog reaches the age of four months subsequent to March 1, no late fee will be charged for the 
license if the owner applies for a license within 30 days after the dog becomes four months old. If it is 
necessary to issue duplicate tags, the fee therefore will be in an amount as adopted by the city 
council from time to time. 
(f) ?Tag to be worn. All dogs shall have and wear at all times a substantial collar of leather, iron, copper, 
brass, or other durable material to which shall be securely attached the license tag herein required. 
No person shall remove the collar or tag from any dog without the consent of the owner or the party 
to whom the license was issued. 
(g) ?Conflict with vicious dog provisions. The licensing or registration requirements of a vicious dog shall 
supersede the requirements of this section insofar as they conflict. 
(h) ?Violations; penalties. 
(1) ?A first of second offense shall be a municipal civil infraction. A first offense shall be subject to a 
fine of $75.00 and a second offense shall be subject to a fine of $150.00. 
(2) ?Third or subsequent offenses shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a fine up to 
$500.00 or up to 90 days in jail or both.

(c) ?Regulation. 
(1) ?Declaration of purpose. The city declares vicious dogs, as defined in this section, have become 
a serious and widespread threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the members of the 
general public. In recent years, vicious dogs have attacked without provocation and seriously 
injured numerous individuals, particularly children, and have also killed people and animals. The 
number and severity of these attacks are attributable to the failure of owners to register, confine 
and properly control vicious dogs. It is further declared that the owning, keeping, or harboring of 
vicious dogs is a nuisance which must be regulated in the interest of the public health, safety, 
and welfare and/or abated. 
(2) ?Impoundment of suspected vicious dog. In the event the animal control officer or any law 
enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a particular dog is vicious and may pose 
a threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals, the animal control officer 
or law enforcement officer may seize and impound the dog pending a hearing or trial pertaining 
to prosecution of the dog owner or other owner, for harboring, keeping, or maintaining a vicious 
dog. The owner and/or other person harboring, keeping, or maintaining the dog shall pay all 
costs and expenses incurred in conjunction with the impoundment of the dog. 
(3) ?Upon conviction of harboring a vicious dog. Upon the conviction of keeping, maintaining, or 
harboring a vicious dog, the dog shall be destroyed, removed from the city, or subject to the 
requirements set forth in subsection (c)(4) of this section as the court deems appropriate. 
(4) ?Requirements for harboring a vicious dog. Upon conviction of an owner or other person for 
keeping, maintaining, or harboring a vicious dog which does not result in an order to destroy the 
dog, and/or upon a determination by a court of appropriate authority that a particular dog is 
vicious but is not subject to destruction, the following requirements shall apply: 
a. ?License application. The owner shall apply to the city clerk's office for a vicious dog license 
which shall be valid for one year from the date of its approval provided all conditions of this 
section and any applicable court order have been met. The license shall be renewable 
provided that the dog is to be kept on the same premises under the same conditions and 
its owner or keeper or person in custody of the dog has not violated any condition of this 
section or court order during the previous license year. No such license shall be 
transferable to a new owner or the dog or to a new location or address where the dog will 
be kept. 
b. ?Insurance. Prior to the receipt of a license, the owner shall present to the city clerk's office 
proof that the owner has procured liability insurance in the amount of at least $100,000.00 
covering any damage or injury which may be caused by such vicious dog during the 12-
month period for which licensing is sought, which policy shall contain a provision requiring 
the city to be named as additional insured for the sole purpose of the city to be notified by 
the insurance company of any cancellation, termination or expiration of the liability 
insurance policy. In addition, the owner shall sign a statement attesting that he or she shall

his or her premises warning of a vicious dog on the premises. Said sign shall be visible and 
capable of being read from the public highway.

pen or structure with secure sides and top attached to the sides. The structure shall be 
embedded in the ground no less than two feet and constructed in accordance with 
standards set forth in the city building code. Such structure shall not exceed six feet in 
height. It shall, in addition, be constructed of materials and consist of a design suitable to 
prevent escape of the dog and entry of young children. Additionally, the size and location 
of the structure shall comply with provisions of chapter 50, pertaining to zoning, including 
lot coverage and setback requirements, applicable to accessory structures on the 
premises. Whenever the dog is inside the structure, the structure shall be locked with a 
padlock or key lock. Such pens or structures must be adequately lit and kept in a clean and 
sanitary condition. 
f. ?Confinement indoors. No vicious dog shall be kept on a porch, patio, or in any part of a 
house or structure that would allow the dog to exit of its own volition. In addition, no such

windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle 
preventing the dog from exiting.

clerk's office with two color photographs of the vicious dog which clearly show the color 
and approximate size of the animal.

vicious dog, to sell or give away the vicious dog, to comply with the commands or 
directions of the court or animal control officer with respect to the vicious dog, or to comply 
with the licensing provisions of this section. In such event, the vicious dog shall be securely 
muzzled and restrained with a choker chain leash having a minimum tensile strength of 
300 pounds and not exceeding three feet in length. The muzzle shall be made in a manner 
that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration, but shall 
prevent it from biting any human or animal. The dog shall be under direct control and 
supervision of the owner of the vicious dog or his or her agent, either of whom shall be, in 
any event, a person 18 years of age or older and physically capable of restraining the 
animal. 
j. ?Reporting requirements. An owner shall notify the police department and animal control 
officer immediately upon discovery that a vicious dog is on the loose, is unconfined, has 
attacked an animal or human being, or has been stolen. An owner shall notify the police 
department and animal control officer in writing within one day of the removal of a vicious

ARTICLE VIII. - VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE 


Sec. 10-211. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to help protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens by 
preventing blight, protecting property values and neighborhood integrity, avoiding the creation and 
maintenance of nuisances and to ensure the safe and sanitary maintenance of dwellings, commercial and 
industrial buildings. It is the intent of this article to address homes and buildings that have become vacant, 
abandoned, or otherwise unsupervised thereby having a negative impact on surrounding properties and 
neighborhoods. Vacant and abandoned homes create an increased instance of unsecured or open doors 
and windows, broken water pipes, flooded basements, theft of metals and other materials, overgrowth of 
grass, weeds, shrubs, and bushes, illegal dumping, and rodent and vermin activity at vacant structures. 
Such neglect devalues properties and causes deterioration in neighborhoods and industrial and 
commercial areas. It is important for the city to be able to contact owners of vacant properties for property 
maintenance, utility shutoff, fire safety, and police reasons.

Sec. 10-212. - Scope.

structures. This article does not relieve an owner from compliance with all other city ordinances, codes, 
rules, regulations, and state law.

accounts so audited and allowed, over and above the actual charges for cutting, destruction and removal, 
administrative fees as currently established or as hereafter adopted by the city council from time to time 
for each cutting performed by the city or for each refuse or debris removal performed by the city. The total 
charges shall immediately constitute a lien and tax upon the land upon which such weeds were cut or

of such report, the director of finance shall forward a statement of the total charges assessed on each 
parcel of property to the owner as shown by the last current assessment or tax roll. The assessment shall 
be payable within 30 days without additional costs. If the assessment is not paid within 30 days, a penalty 
of five percent shall be added, and the total amount of the assessment and penalty will be transferred or 
reassessed upon the next county tax roll. The director of finance shall, on or before October 10 of such 
year, prepare a report of all parcels of property upon which assessments have not been paid, and such 
unpaid assessments shall be reassessed upon the next county tax roll in a column headed "Weed and 
Refuse Ordinance Assessment," together with the penalty of five percent to cover the cost thereof. Such 
assessments, when reassessed upon the county tax roll, shall be collected and paid in all respects as 
provided for the collection of county taxes. When these assessments are collected they shall be paid into 
the city treasury to reimburse the outlay therefrom as hereinbefore provided.

whatever measures are necessary to remove the conditions or accumulations contributing to the violation 
and to exterminate or otherwise eliminate the rats. The costs incurred by the city for the same shall be

unnecessary or unusual noise or any noise which annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, 
repose, health, peace or safety of others, within the limits of the city.

appropriate balance between the right of individuals to obtain information and derive pleasure by 
listening to radios and other devices and the right of the public to a peaceful and healthful 
environment. Therefore, the following restrictions shall govern the broadcasting of such sound within 
the city: 
(1) ?The playing, transmitting, amplifying, or other broadcasting of personal or commercial music or 
sound, by electronic or other technological means installed in a residence, commercial

establishment, motor vehicle or otherwise portable, in such a manner that it is plainly audible in 
a public place or residential neighborhood by any person other than the operator between the 
hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., is prohibited. 
(e) ?Violations involving broadcasts from a motor vehicle. For violations of this subsection involving 
broadcasts from a motor vehicle, the operator of the motor vehicle shall be presumed to have 
dominion and control over the source of the broadcast, and shall therefore be presumed to be 
responsible for the violation. Passengers, or others lacking an ownership interest, may be found 
guilty of violating this subsection if such persons had constructive dominion and control over the 
source of the broadcast, or otherwise aided and abetted the operator. 
(f) ?Permitted use of sound amplification. This section shall not be applicable to mobile sound 
amplification for which a valid city permit has been issued, or for which such sound amplification is 
incidental to and appropriate for the use of a valid city permit, such as for parades, ice cream trucks, 
and similar activities, so long as such activities comply with the terms of any such city permit. 
(g) ?Exceptions. None of the terms or prohibitions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall apply to 
or be enforced against:

ARTICLE XI. - SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA AND DANGEROUS PRODUCTS[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1070, adopted July 3, 2012, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 28-316
28-321. To preserve the style of this Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been 
included as §§ 28-33128-336. 


Sec. 28-331. - Findings, intent and purpose. 
(a) ?The city finds that synthetic marijuana, consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or 
other substances that have not been approved for human consumption, is being marketed and sold 
as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana, 
with that use having become increasingly popular, particularly among teens and young adults. 
(b) ?The city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers, hospitals, 
emergency room doctors, and police agencies, that individuals who use synthetic marijuana 
experience dangerous side effects including convulsions, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, 
unconsciousness, anxiety attacks, dangerously elevated heart rates, increased blood pressure, 
vomiting, and disorientation, evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed 
and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products 
and other persons coming in contact with them. 
(c) ?The city further finds that, notwithstanding the high potential for abuse, and lack of any accepted 
medical use, the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled 
substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the 
manufacturing process. 
(d) ?The city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana, there may be other products or 
materials containing chemicals or substances, that while not approved for human consumption, are 
or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which, upon 
consumption, may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic 
marijuana. 
(e) ?Based on these findings, this article is adopted for the purpose and with the intent to protect the 
public health and safety of the city and it residents from the threat posed by the availability and use 
of synthetic marijuana and other dangerous products by prohibiting persons from trafficking in, 
possessing, and using them in the city.

contains one or more of those substances if it is being or has been marketed or sold for a price that is 
substantially higher than the price at which the same quantity of a similar and comparable product or 
material that is known to not contain such substances can be purchased.

Sec. 28-336. - Violations, penalty.

herein, which shall be subject to inspection by the chief of police upon request. 
(b) ?Every licensee, owner and employee, shall keep a record of all persons and/or entities with whom 
business has transacted and all property coming into their possession. Reports must be 
electronically transmitted to the chief of police or his/her designee. Within 48 hours a report must be 
transmitted by means of electronic transmission through a modem, or similar device in a format that 
the data is capable of direct electronic entry into the police department's computerized system, as 
approved by the chief of police, or his or her designee for identifying property coming into the 
possession of a licensor, including but not limited to all pawn property, all transactions in which used 
goods have been received the preceding day by pawn, trade, purchase, or consignment and items 
received by junk dealers. A transaction report by electronic transmission under this sub section shall 
not be reported on paper forms, unless the chief of police, or his or her designee so requires. All 
secondhand dealers, junk dealers, and pawnbrokers must have the equipment installed in their place 
of business no later than August 1, 2012. Information must be reported electronically beginning 
August 1, 2012. If the volume of transactions does not exceed ten for a 90-day period, transactions 
taking place at that business may not be reported electronically, but shall be reported on paper forms 
approved by the chief of police, or his or her designee. 
(c) ?A fee as adopted and subject to change periodically by the city council may be assessed per

business interface, or on the vendor's automated reported service that involves transactions subject 
to the provision of this article. 
(d) ?Transaction is defined as a single buy, or which may involve one or more items and does not

item fee included in the transaction. It is within the sole discretion of the secondhand dealer whether 
to recover the fee, if assessed, from their customers for registering a transaction. 
(e) ?If said fee is assessed, the licensee will be invoiced on a monthly basis. The city's vendor 
automated reporting service isolates and generates a list of the billable transactions that will be used 
for deriving invoiced amounts. The above fees, if assessed, are for the use of the standard vendor's 
automated recording service. Any custom programming completed for the secondhand dealer will be 
negotiated on a contract basis and may result in additional licensing arrangements between the 
vendor and the licensor. Sales tax will be added to the above amounts where applicable. Failure to 
timely pay as invoiced is a violation of this article.

as a licensed pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or junk dealer. No person shall sell, offer for sale, 
advertise for sale or represent an out of pawn article or personal thing as being out of pawn when the 
same has not been pawned or pledged with such person as a licensed pawnbroker, secondhand 
dealer or junk dealer. No pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or junk dealer shall purchase any 
secondhand furniture, metals, clothing or other articles or things, or sell, dispose or keep for sale any 
such secondhand articles or things, except as the same may have been pawned to him or her or 
have been sold at public auction to the highest bidder. Any articles sold to such pawnbroker, 
secondhand dealer or junk dealer, upon the understanding that such article is to be purchased from 
such pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or junk dealer by the seller thereof, or by any person acting for 
such seller, shall be deemed to be pawned within the meaning of this article. 
(b) ?No licensee, or agent, or employee shall conceal or misrepresent the identity by removing, 
concealing, defacing, adding to, substituting, or altering, the serial number or manufacturer's number

any item as described hereinabove from which the serial numbers have been removed, concealed,

junk dealer or owner or employee of any of the foregoing, the item must not be sold, or removed 
from the premises. If the hold was conveyed verbally, the hold shall be confirmed by the investigating 
agency within 72 hours either in writing, or by electronic transmission. The order to hold the item

additional 60 days. Each licensee and owner shall be jointly and severally liable for holding such

time is intoxicated, or appears to be under the influence of a controlled substance, or is known to be 
a thief, or receiver of stolen property, or from any person who is suspected not to be the owner of the 
property, or from any minor under the age of 18 years.

(a) ?Except as otherwise provided by state law, each record of a transaction shall be retained by the 
dealer for not less than one year after the transaction to which the record pertains. 
(b) ?Within 48 hours after receiving or purchasing a precious item, the dealer shall send a copy of the 
record of transaction form to the police department and, if the record of transaction form indicates 
that the customer resides outside the jurisdiction of the city, the dealer shall send a copy of the 
record of transaction form to the police agency of the city, village, or township in which the customer 
resides as set forth on the record of transaction, or, if that city, village, or township does not have a 
police agency, to the sheriff's department of the county in which the customer resides as set forth on 
the record of transaction. 
(1) ?Every licensee, owner and employee, shall keep a record of all persons and/or entities with 
whom business has transacted and all property coming into their possession. Reports must be 
electronically transmitted to the chief of police or his or her designee. Within 48 hours a report 
must be transmitted by means of electronic transmission through a modem, or similar device in 
a format that the data is capable of direct electronic entry into the city's police department's 
computerized system, as approved by the chief of police, or his or her designee for identifying 
property coming into the possession of a licensor, including but not limited to all pawn property, 
all transactions in which used goods have been received the preceding day by pawn, trade, 
purchase, or consignment and items received by junk dealers. A transaction report by electronic 
transmission under this section shall not be reported on paper forms, unless the chief of police, 
or his or her designee so requires. All secondhand dealers, junk dealers, and pawnbrokers must 
have the equipment installed in their place of business no later than August 1, 2012. Information 
must be reported electronically beginning September 1, 2012. If the volume of transactions 
does not exceed ten for a 90-day period, transactions taking place at that business may not be 
reported electronically, but shall be reported on paper forms approved by the chief of police, or 
his or her designee. 
(2) ?A fee may be assessed per transaction after being adopted and subject to change periodically 
by the city council. If a fee is assessed, the vendor will assess the property registration fee for 
each transaction, the licensee reports either through batch file upload, or directly using the 
vendor's business interface, or on the vendor's automated reported service that involves 
transactions subject to the provision of this chapter. 
(3) ?Transaction is defined as a single buy, of which may involve one or more items and does not 
include a contract extension or claim. The per transaction registration fee, if assessed, is not a 
per item fee, included in the transaction. It is within the sole discretion of the secondhand dealer 
whether to recover the fee, if assessed, from their customers for registering a transaction. 
(4) ?If said fee is assessed, the licensee will be invoiced on a monthly basis. The city's vendor 
automated reporting service isolates and generates a list of the billable transactions will be used 
for deriving invoiced amounts. The above fees, if assessed, are for the use of the standard 
vendor's automated recording service. Any custom programming completed for the secondhand 
dealer will be negotiated on a contract basis and may result in additional licensing 
arrangements between the vendor and the licensor. Sales tax will be added to the above 
amounts where applicable. Failure to timely pay as invoiced shall constitute a violation of this 
chapter. 
(c) ?The record of transaction forms received by a police agency or sheriff's department shall not be 
open to inspection by the general public. Each police agency or sheriff's department holding record 
of transaction forms shall be responsible for insuring the confidentiality of the record of transaction

diameter that can be fed into a brush chipping machine will be picked up. All tree branches, 
brush cuttings and shrubs must be free from dirt, roots, wire and metal objects and must be 
stacked at the curb in an orderly manner with large ends in one direction. Tree stumps,

on the premises between weekly curbside collections. The user of the city provided

container repair/replacement costs will be made by a representative of the department of 
public works and service as assigned by the director. Except for containers purchased from 
the refuse collection service provider, issued containers remain the property of the refuse

director. Those improperly relocated and setout containers shall be reclaimed by the 
service provider as a violation abatement, emptied of any waste found in them, and 
returned to the properly issued location. This violation abatement service will be 
documented but no advance notice to the responsible party or to the property owner is 
required prior to the abatement service being performed. The cost of this violation 
abatement, as authorized under section 36-25, shall be assessed to the owner of the 
property where the container was issued and/or to the responsible party who moved the 
container and/or to the owner of the property where the cart was set out, discovered, and

or reconstruction of any sidewalk or driveway approach in any street in front of or adjoining private 
property, it shall be the duty of the city manager to give notice by November 1 of the year prior to 
construction, repair or reconstruction by mailing a copy of such notice, by first class mail, to the 
property owner at the address shown on the last current assessment or tax roll. 
(b) ?This notice shall state: 
    Date of Notice: 
    Dear Property Owner: 
    RE: (current year) SIDEWALK/DRIVEWAY APPROACH REPLACEMENT PROGRAM 
    In the spring of ____________ , the City of Eastpointe will be inspecting the driveway approach 
and/or sidewalk and/or courtesy walk in front of and/or adjacent to your property for damaged or 
hazardous conditions that are in need of replacement. This letter is to inform you now that this program 
will be beginning in (date to be determined) . 
    As a homeowner you have THREE options to choose from. They are listed below for your review. 
    Option #1: The City will assign a licensed contractor to perform any necessary work on your 
property. 
    The estimated cost for these repairs will vary from property to property. The cost could range from 
APPROXIMATELY $ ____________ to $ ____________ depending on the amount of concrete replaced. 
The AVERAGE cost per home has been around $ ____________ to $ ____________ in the past years. A 
more accurate estimate will be sent to you a minimum of 30 days prior to the work being done. 
    Work performed by the City will be charged as follows: 
    Installation charges invoiced are payable within 30 days of invoice. (NO PARTIAL PAYMENTS) After 
due date, ½% per month interest will be added until paid. Unpaid sidewalk invoices are compiled into a 
Special Assessment Roll at which time an additional 5% is added to cover the expense of preparing the 
roll as well as the cost of publication and/or mailing of hearing on the roll. 
    After the assessment roll is confirmed, properties whose square footage exceeds 80 square feet will 
have their unpaid balance divided into two equal parts payable in annual installments with 6% interest 
added on the balance. 
    OPTION #2: You may hire your own private contractor to do the work. 
    The contractor MUST obtain a permit from the Building Department at City Hall before any work 
begins. The cost for permits is determined by the fee schedule. 
    In addition, all forms must be checked by the City Inspector prior to pouring cement in order that the 
proper grade, pitch and other provisions of the City Sidewalk Ordinance are complied with. 
    Inspection is also necessary to assure satisfactory construction and to prevent irresponsible 
contractors from using inferior material and performing poor workmanship at your expense. The City 
Inspector should be contacted by you or your contractor at least one day in advance of the required 
inspection at (586) 445-5010. 
    OPTION #3: You may elect to install your own sidewalk/driveway. Similar in procedure to Option #2, 
you must obtain a permit from City Hall, call for site inspection and complete the work within 21 days from 
the date of letter. 
    If you wish to do your own work, all broken concrete must be removed by you or at your expense. 
    In the event we do not hear from you, then OPTION #1 will be assigned and the work completed 
assessed against the property. 
    In conclusion, we all take pride in the appearance of your property and do everything possible to 
preserve its value. Through the City's Sidewalk/Driveway Approach Replacement Program we are striving 
not only to improve the appearances of our property but also to provide safer sidewalks for pedestrian 
traffic. For any additional information concerning this program feel free to contact the Building 
Department.

hereof, the city manager shall give final notice of the construction, repair or reconstruction by mailing

in an amount as adopted by the city council from time to time will be made. If the meter is found 
defective, it shall be repaired or an accurate meter installed and no charge shall be made. 
(f) ?Standard of accuracy. A meter shall be considered accurate if, when tested, it registers not more 
than two percent more or two percent less than the actual quantity of water passing through it. If a 
meter registers in excess of two percent more than the actual quantity of water passing through it, it 
shall be considered fast to that extent. If a meter registers in excess of two percent less than the 
actual quantity of water passing through it, it shall be considered slow to that extent. 
(g) ?Bill adjustment. If a meter has been tested at the request of a consumer and has been determined 
to register fast, the city shall credit the consumer with a sum equal to the percentage that it is fast 
multiplied by the amount of all bills incurred by such consumer within the six months prior to the test. 
If a meter so tested is determined to register slow, the department may collect from the consumer a 
sum equal to the percentage that it is slow multiplied by the amount of all the bills incurred by the 
consumer for the prior six months. When the department, on its own initiative, makes a test of a 
water meter, it shall be done without cost to the consumer, other than his or her paying the amount 
due the city for water used by him or her, as herein provided, if the meter is found to be slow. 
(h) ?Relocation. No person shall relocate a meter on his or her premises without first obtaining a permit 
therefor from the department and paying a fee therefor in an amount as adopted by the city council 
from time to time. Such work shall be done only by a licensed plumber, but the homeowner shall 
have the responsibility of obtaining the permit and paying the fee therefor.

Sec. 46-54. - Findings. 
(a) ?Necessity for potable water. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms that the 
businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies and residents located in the city need 
to have potable and otherwise usable water. 
(b) ?Availability of potable water. The city council further has previously found, and currently reaffirms, 
that the supply of potable water available from private wells within the city is insufficient to ensure 
that all businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies, and residents will have 
sufficient potable water available for their use and other water necessary for industrial and fire 
prevention and control unless the city offers water to all properties located within the city. 
(c) ?Method for measuring use of water supply system. Based on advice of its engineers, the city council 
has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the most precise method, given available 
technology, of measuring the use of the water supply from the system by any user is by a meter or 
meters installed and controlled by the city. 
(d) ?Continuation of service. The city council has previously found, and further currently reaffirms that, in 
order to provide and continue to provide clean potable and other usable water to all customers of the 
system, in quantities necessary for all varieties of use, it is necessary from time to time to install 
improvements, enlargements, extensions and repairs to the system. 
(e) ?Purpose of charges. The charges and fees for the use of and connection to the system are hereby 
established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, 
repair, and operation of the system and to comply with federal and state safe drinking water acts and 
related regulations, to provide for the payment principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to 
be issued as and when the same become due and payable, to create a bond and interest 
redemption fund therefor, to provide a fund for reasonable and necessary improvements to the 
system and to provide for such other funds as are necessary to meet contractual obligations of the 
issuer. Such charges and fees shall be made in accordance with the purposes herein described as 
well as the following: 
(1) ?All premises connected directly or indirectly to the system, except as hereinafter provided, shall 
be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this 
section. 
(2) ?The charges, rates and fees for water service by the system are established herein to 
adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system does not operate at a 
deficit. 
(3) ?The system staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges, rates, fees, rules 
and regulations of the system, which review shall be completed not less than one time per fiscal 
year. Results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any 
adjustments. 
(4) ?The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable 
proportion to the cost of serving those users. 
(f) ?Proportionality, fairness, and benefits of charges, rates and fees. 
(1) ?The city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most 
reasonable method of providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and 
improvement of the system is to charge each user, based in all cases on amount of use, for the 
costs of: 
a. ?Retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements 
and replacements to the system; 
b. ?Ongoing repair, replacement and improvement budgeted as part of the annual costs of the 
system; and 
c. ?Operation, administration and maintenance costs of the system. 
(2) ?The city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the water service 
provided by the system. Based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers, the city 
council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that to ensure the stability and viability of 
the system for the benefit of its users, the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs 
of operation, maintenance, replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user: 
a. ?A separate capital connection charge for water service when such user's property is first 
connected to the system; 
b. ?A monthly service charge for water service, which varies depending on the size of the 
water intake pipe and meter, which charge reflects each user's proportionate share of the 
fixed costs of the system; and 
c. ?A commodity charge for water usage which is based on the user's actual use of water 
supplied by the system. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms that 
the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs 
of the system among the users of the system and that capital connection charge, the 
monthly service charge and the commodity charge each provide actual benefits to such 
users in the form of ready access to water service that would be unavailable if such 
charges were not charged. 
(3) ?In addition to the findings set forth in this section, the city council has previously found and 
currently reaffirms that the capital connection charges reflect the proportional capital costs of 
the system, previously paid by the city and the system, attributable to each new user and that 
the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or 
greater than the amount of such charges.

Sec. 46-55. - Establishment of water supply system. 
    Based on the findings and for the purposes set forth in section 46-54, the city has previously 
established and hereby reestablishes the water supply system, consisting of all water mains, pumping 
and storage facilities, pressure systems, wells, connections, service pipes, meters, and all other 
appurtenances to the system.

All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an 
industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 CFR 136. 
a. ?The limitation for Total PCB is nondetect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable 
levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 
?gm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix 
interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of Total PCB, the user 
shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this 
demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the Total PCB 
concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with 56-
3-66.1(d). 
b. ?The limitation of mercury (Hg) is nondetect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at 
detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall 
not exceed 0.2 ?gm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated 
sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of 
mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this 
section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury 
concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with 56-
3-66.1(d). All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period 
representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 CFR 136. 
(3) ?Compliance period. Within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this 
division is derived, the department shall notify all industrial user's operating under an effective 
wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within 180 days 
after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived. The compliance 
report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or noncompliance with these limitations, and, in 
the event of noncompliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving 
compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed 18 
months from the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived. An industrial 
user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension 
as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, 
reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, 
and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of 
the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 
(c) ?National categorical pretreatment standards. All users shall comply with the applicable national 
categorical pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 
40 CFR Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by 
reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, that where a more 
stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this division, 
then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall 
comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403 and as established by the 
department. The national categorical pretreatment standards which have been promulgated as of the 
effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived are delineated in section 46-144. 
(1) ?Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of national categorical 
pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply 
with the requirements of 40 CFR 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the 
adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are 
not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
(2) ?Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The department may apply to the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the state department of environmental quality, 
whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the 
requirements and procedures in 40 CFR 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when 
the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a 
removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant in the NPDES 
permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the 
removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any 
industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, 
consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 403.7 and of this chapter. Any credits which may be 
granted under this section may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 CFR 
403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit 
may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants 
removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the board may 
establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to 
reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
(3) ?New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in 
operating condition, and start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable 
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not 
to exceed 90 days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(4) ?Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are 
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert 
the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or 
effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual 
industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with sections 40 CFR 
403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 CFR 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the 
purposes of 33 USC 1317(d) and of this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with 
the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the 
equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5) ?Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment 
standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment 
standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category 
determination submission under section 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing 
industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging 
into or scheduled to discharge into the City of Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a 
report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1) through (7). Where reports 
containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator 
in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be 
required to resubmit this information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, 
each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation 
of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which 
contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1) through (5). In such report, new sources 
shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to 
meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information 
requested in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4) and (5). 
(d) ?Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment 
standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or 
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve 
compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in 
any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the City of Eastpointe, the City of 
Detroit or by the state. 
(e) ?Hauled in wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service 
region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this chapter including, but not 
limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from 
hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pretreatment, is 
prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit 
from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the board's rules pertaining 
thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges, fees or rates 
as established by the board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by 
the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirements 
specified in section 46-137. The department may establish specific limitations for sludge from 
municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific 
limitations in this chapter. 
(f) ?Centralized waste treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to 
discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit 
from the department. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the department to a centralized 
waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, 
and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is 
determined by the department to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) 
facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the department to 
discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the department before 
discharging such wastewater. An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services 
and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW, 
shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof: 
(1) ?The general nature, source and process generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater, 
which is generated from those processes and is subject to national categorical pretreatment 
standards as delineated in section 46-144, shall be so designated; 
(2) ?The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 
(3) ?At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for 
each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection (f)(1) of this section; 
(4) ?A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which addresses the treatability and 
compatibility of the wastewater, received or collected by the facility's treatment process; 
(5) ?The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by 
the EPA, by the state, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized 
waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the 
department; and 
(6) ?Other information requested by the department including, but not limited to, information 
required by section 46-137(c)(1) through (18), or by rules adopted by the board. The discharge 
from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific 
types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance 
with the procedures contained in section 46-137, will be deemed approved for discharge into 
the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable 
provisions contained in section 46-137 regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as 
control authority, the department may include in the permit a requirement to report at selected 
intervals the information mandated in subsections (f)(1) through (f)(6) of this section. 
All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the 
source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. 
These records may be reviewed at any time by the department. 
(g) ?Groundwater discharges. 
(1) ?Unless authorization has been granted by the department, the discharge of any groundwater 
into the POTW is prohibited. 
(2) ?The department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and 
related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject 
to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in 
accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within 180 days 
after its enactment. 
(3) ?If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity, or 
UST projects, has applied for and received a permit from the department, the department may 
authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the 
procedures contained in section 46-137, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the board. 
(h) ?City of Eastpointe right of revision. The City of Detroit and the City of Eastpointe reserve the right to 
establish rules or regulations adopted by the board, additional or more stringent limitations or 
requirements on discharges to the POTW. These rules and regulations shall be adopted in 
accordance with the rule-making procedures section 2-111 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter. Ninety 
days after adoption by the board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations. 
(i) ?Accidental discharges. 
(1) ?Each industrial user, which does not currently have an approved spill prevention plan or slug 
control plan, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other 
substances regulated by this division, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the 
department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to 
provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and 
abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner's or 
industrial user's cost or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill 
prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users shall complete and submit 
such a plan within 60 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is 
derived (November 19, 1986). New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to 
the time they commence discharging. For purposes of this section, the information provided 
shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or 
substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste 
therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which 
could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five percent or greater 
in the raw material, chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of 
less than 55 gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities 
could cause pass-through or cause interference with the POTW. 
The industrial user shall promptly notify the department of any significant changes or 
modifications to the plan, including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person, or 
substance inventory. 
(2) ?At least once every two years, the department shall evaluate whether a significant industrial 
user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless 
otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan 
within 30 days of notification by the department. 
(j) ?Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this division or applicable law, 
within one hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not 
conform with federal, state or city laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could 
cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its 
plan prepared in accordance with subsection (i)(1) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone 
the department at its control center and notify the department of the discharge. The notification shall 
include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the 
estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the 
measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days 
after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of 
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and 
when required by the department, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified 
to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve 
the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be 
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any 
other damage to persons or property. 
(k) ?Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board, or 
other prominent place, advising employees whom to contact in the department in the event of an 
actual or excessive or prohibited discharge. 
(l) ?Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this division, which 
produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the department's POTW, or 
causes the department to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the department for any 
expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the department because of said violation or 
discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department shall notify the user of its determination 
that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or 
violation of the city's NPDES permit and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. 
Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of 
proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall 
constitute a violation of this division. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any 
penalties or remedies provided under this division, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or 
at law or in equity. 
(m) ?Hazardous waste notification. All industrial users, who discharge into the city collection system, 
shall notify the department in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, 
would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261. Such notification must comply with the 
requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
(n) ?Authorized representative. The authorized representative, as defined in section 46-131, may 
designate a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in section 46-131 where: 
(1) ?The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in section 46-131; 
(2) ?The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall 
operation of the facility where the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant 
manager, operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent 
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and 
(3) ?The written authorization is submitted to the department. 
(o) ?Pollution prevention. The department shall encourage and support industrial users to develop and 
implement pollution prevention programs that are designed to eliminate or reduce pollutant 
contributions beyond the levels required by this division. The department may require an industrial 
user to implement pollution prevention initiatives or BMP, as part of an enforcement response, or as 
necessary to comply with its NPDES permit.

(Code 1989, § 1048.06; Ord. No. 967, 12-20-2005) 


Sec. 46-137. - Wastewater discharge permits. 
(a) ?Required. It shall be unlawful for users to discharge into the POTW any wastewater which will cause 
interference or pass-through, or otherwise not comply with the discharge prohibitions of section 46-
135. It shall be unlawful for a significant industrial user to discharge into the POTW without a 
wastewater discharge permit from the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Unless 
otherwise expressly authorized by the department through permit, order, rule or regulation, any 
discharge must be in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(1) ?All significant industrial users, which are in existence on the effective date of the ordinance 
from which this division is derived, shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 30 days 
of the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived. Significant industrial 
users who are currently operating with a valid wastewater discharge permit are not subject to 
this provision. These applications are to include all information specified in subsection (c) of this 
section and, where applicable, any additional information which may be needed to satisfy the 
federal baseline monitoring report requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b). 
(2) ?All new significant users shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit at least 90 days prior to 
commencement of discharge. The application must include all information specified in 
subsection (c) of this section and, where applicable, any additional information that may be 
needed to satisfy the federal BMP requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b). Until a permit is issued 
and finalized by the department, no discharge shall be made into the POTW. 
(3) ?Any user, who proposes to discharge any wastewater other than sanitary or noncontact cooling 
water into the POTW, shall request approval from the department for the discharge at least 30 
days prior to the commencement of the discharge. 
(b) ?Permit application or reapplication. The department may require any user to complete a 
questionnaire and/or a permit application and to submit the same to the department for determining 
whether the industrial user is a significant user, or to determine changes in the wastewater 
discharges from a user's facility. Within 30 days of being so notified, a user shall comply with the 
department's request in the manner and form prescribed by the department. Failure of the 
department to so notify a user shall not relieve the user of the duty to obtain a permit as required by 
this division. 
(1) ?A user, which becomes subject to a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard, 
shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 90 days after the promulgation of the 
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, unless an earlier date is specified or

by the department. A compliance report shall be submitted to the department no later than 
90 days following the final compliance date for a standard, or in the case of a new source, 
no later than 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the 
POTW, and in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(d). A report on continued compliance shall 
be submitted at six-month intervals thereafter on the schedule established by the 
department and incorporated into the industrial users discharge permit and in accordance 
with subsections (e)(8)d. and e. of this section. The reports shall be either on a form 
prescribed by the department or on an alternate form approved by the department, and 
shall indicate the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from each 
regulated process which are limited by national categorical pretreatment standards, or on 
which there is a specific limitation in the permit, or which may be identified by the 
department in accordance with subsections (e)(9) and (11) of this section. The report shall 
include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the 
reporting period for the discharges regulated by the permit. The combined wastestream 
formula may be used for reporting purposes after the initial information has been furnished 
to the department, provided there have been no changes to the elements composing the 
combined wastestream. 
d. ?Reports shall contain the results of representative sampling performed during the period 
covered by the report and of the discharge and analysis of pollutants contained therein, 
and, for significant industrial users subject to production based standards, shall be cross-
referenced to the related flow or production and mass as required to determine compliance 
with the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be as 
prescribed in the applicable general pretreatment regulations, being 40 CFR 403, or by the 
department, but no less than is necessary to assess and assure compliance by the 
industrial user with the most stringent applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
All sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with applicable regulations 
contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not include 
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, sampling and analysis shall 
be performed using validated analytical methods approved by the administrator. If an 
industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the department 
using the procedures as prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be 
included in such report. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment 
standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and 
maintenance practices and/or pretreatment system improvements or changes are 
necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment 
standards. 
e. ?This report, and those required under section 46-135 and subsections (e)(8)b. and c. of this 
section, shall include the following certification statement: 
    "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared 
under my direction, or supervision, in accordance with a system designed to ensure that 
qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my 
inquiry of the person who manages the system, or those persons directly responsible for 
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and 
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for 
submitting false information, including the possibility of a fine and/or imprisonment for 
knowing violations." 
Said certification shall be signed by the facility's authorized representative, as defined in 
section 46-131. If an authorization is no longer accurate because a different individual or 
position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for 
environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of 
the authorized representative definition must be submitted to the department prior to, or 
together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
f. ?If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation, the user shall notify the 
department within 24 hours of the time said user becomes, or should have become, aware 
of the violation. In addition, the user shall repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the 
results of the repeat analysis to the department within 30 days after said user becomes or 
should have become aware of the violation. 
(9) ?In the event the director determines that an industrial user is discharging substances in quality, 
quantity or at locations which may cause problems to the POTW, or the receiving stream, the 
department has the authority to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the 
extent the department seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more restrictive than 
established in this division, the department shall provide written documentation to explain the 
greater restriction for protection against pass-through, interference, or violation of the NPDES 
permit; 
(10) ?Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives; and 
(11) ?Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with this division. 
(f) ?Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period. Except as deemed necessary by 
the department, or as otherwise provided for under this division, permits shall be issued for a 
specified period of not more than five years nor less than one year. The existing permit for significant 
industrial users, who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the department, shall be 
automatically extended until a permit is issued as final. 
(g) ?Permit modification. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the 
department during the term of the permit as limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements 
identified in section 46-135 are amended, or other just cause exists. Just cause for a permit 
modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1) ?Material or substantial changes to an industrial user's facility or operation, or changes in the 
characteristics of the industrial user's effluent. It shall be the industrial user's duty to request an 
application form and apply for a modification of the permit within 30 calendar days of the 
change; 
(2) ?Change in the department's NPDES permit; 
(3) ?Embodiment of the provisions of a legal settlement or of a court order; 
(4) ?Any changes necessary to fulfill the department's role as control authority; 
(5) ?An industrial user's noncompliance with portions of an existing permit;

(7) ?A finding of interference or pass-through attributable to the industrial user; 
(8) ?Amendments to, or promulgation of, national categorical pretreatment standards or 
requirements including 40 CFR 403 and those delineated in section 46-144. Permittees shall 
request an application form and apply to the Department for a modified permit within 90 days 
after the promulgation of a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard to which 
the industrial user shall be subject. Information submitted pursuant to this subsection shall be 
confined to that information related to the newly promulgated or amended national categorical 
pretreatment standard or requirement. However, information previously submitted need not be 
duplicated, insofar as the previously submitted information continues to be current and 
applicable. In addition, the department may initiate this action; 
(9) ?Changes in the monitoring location. See section 46-138; 
(10) ?Typographical errors or omissions in permits; 
(11) ?The department may modify the permit on its own initiative based on its findings or 
reasonable belief of the above; or 
(12) ?The user may request a modification of the permit. 
When initiated by the department, the industrial user shall be informed of any proposed change in its 
permit. The department will issue a draft permit and an industrial user has 30 days to file a response to 
the draft modified permit. Thereafter, the department will issue a final permit and, unless appealed in 
accordance with the procedures contained in section 46-144, the permit will become effective 20 days 
after issuance. 
(h) ?Permit custody and transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific person as 
defined herein for a specific discharge. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or 
transferred or sold to a different person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new 
or changed operation without notice to and written approval of the department, and providing a copy 
of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. It shall be the permit holder's duty to notify the 
department of any such change at least 30 days before the date of the change. Wastewater 
discharge permits which do not receive the written approval of the department prior to the change 
shall be null and void regardless of reassignment, or transfer, or sale. If it has occurred, the 
department may revoke a permit. If a change takes place, the department may require the 
application for a new or modified permit. Any succeeding person shall comply with the terms and 
conditions of any existing permit which the department allows to be retained. 
(i) ?Permit notification requirements. All industrial users shall promptly notify the department in advance 
of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the 
listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p) has 
been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a modification of the permit at least 30 
calendar days prior to the change. Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a 
violation of this chapter. 
(Code 1989, § 1048.07; Ord. No. 967, 12-20-2005) 


Sec. 46-138. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a) ?Significant industrial users shall provide, operate and maintain at their own expense a sampling 
manhole or special structure to facilitate monitoring, inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of 
their discharge by the department and the industrial user, and to enable the department to conduct 
such other monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with discharge 
requirements, limits and standards as provided for in this chapter. In the event the department 
determines that the monitoring facility identified in the permit application is inadequate, a new 
monitoring facility must be identified, or provided, which shall allow for collection of a representative 
sample of the wastewater discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise determined at the discretion 
of the department, said facility shall be provided within 90 days of receipt of notification by the 
department. The industrial user shall provide the department with: 
(1) ?A drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by the size, location, 
elevation, and points or places of discharges into the POTW; 
(2) ?A flow schematic showing: which connections receive each national categorical process 
wastestream; which connections receive stormwater, sanitary water or cooling water; and which 
lines handle each combined wastestream. This report shall be certified by a professional 
engineer. If a significant industrial user fails to install the monitoring facilities within the 
prescribed time limits, then the department may install such structure or device and the 
significant user shall reimburse the department for any costs incurred therein. 
(b) ?The sampling manhole should be situated on the industrial user's premises in a location readily 
accessible to the department. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to 
the industrial user, the department may allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or 
sidewalk area when there is room and the location will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked 
vehicles. It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals which 
may be required from other government agencies for the location and construction of monitoring 
facilities. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring manhole or facility to 
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and any permanently 
installed sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper 
operating condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed upon public or private 
property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the 
department's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. See 
section 46-137(g). 
(Code 1989, § 1048.08; Ord. No. 967, 12-20-2005) 


Sec. 46-139. - Inspection, sampling and record keeping. 
(a) ?For purposes of administering and enforcing this division, any other applicable provisions of this 
Code or applicable state or federal laws and regulations, the department may inspect the 
establishment, facility or other premises of the industrial user. The department's employees or 
authorized representative shall have access to the industrial user's premises for purposes of 
inspection, sampling, compliance monitoring and/or metering activities. 
(b) ?Each such inspection or sampling activity shall be commenced and completed at reasonable times, 
and in a reasonable manner. Upon arrival at the industrial user's premises, the department shall 
inform the industrial user, or the industrial user's employees, that sampling and/or inspection is 
commencing, and that the facility's authorized representative has the right to observe the inspection 
and/or sampling. The department shall neither refrain from, nor be prevented or delayed from, 
carrying out its inspection or sampling duties due to the unavailability of the authorized 
representative of the facility to observe or participate in the inspection or sampling activity. 
(c) ?While performing work on private property, employees or authorized representatives of the 
department shall observe all reasonable safety, security and other reasonable rules applicable to the 
premises as established by the industrial user. Duly authorized employees or representatives of the 
department shall bear proper credentials and identification, and at the industrial user's option may be 
accompanied by a duly authorized representative of the industrial user. Duly authorized department 
representatives shall not be restricted from viewing any of the facility site. Department employees or 
representatives may take photographs of facilities subject to this chapter, which shall be maintained 
by the department as confidential in accordance with section 46-140. 
(d) ?Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the industrial user shall make prompt and 
necessary arrangements with the security personnel so that, upon presentation of appropriate 
credentials, personnel from the department will be permitted to enter for the purposes of performing 
their specific responsibilities. 
(e) ?Significant industrial users shall sample and analyze their discharge in accordance with the 
provisions of their permit. The department may require such samples to be split with the department 
for the department's independent analysis. 
(f) ?Industrial users shall maintain records of all information from monitoring activities required by this 
division, or by 40 CFR 403.12(n). Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than three 
years. This period of record retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation 
regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user, or the operation of the City of Detroit's 
Industrial Waste Program, or when requested by the department, by the state, or by the EPA. 
(g) ?Upon the request of the department, industrial users shall furnish information and records relating to 
discharges into the POTW. Industrial users shall make such records readily accessible to the 
department at all reasonable times, and allow the department to copy such records. 
(h) ?In the event the department obtains samples, and analyses are made of such samples, a copy of 
the results of such analyses shall be promptly furnished upon written request by the industrial user's 
authorized representative. When requested by the industrial user, the department employee or 
representative shall leave with the user, a portion of any sample of the user's discharge taken from 
any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the user's independent analysis. In cases of 
disputes arising over shared samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the department shall be 
controlling unless proven invalid. 
(i) ?In addition to any other violation caused by the discharge described herein, in the event a single 
grab sample of the industrial user's discharge is obtained by the department, and then analyzed in 
accordance with 40 CFR 136, and found to contain concentrations of pollutants which are two or 
more times greater than the numeric limitations as listed in section 46-135(b), or as contained in the 
facility's wastewater discharge permit, the industrial user shall implement its slug control plan, and 
shall provide a written report to the department within 14 days, which describes the cause of greater 
concentration and provides a description of the means by which future discharge concentrations will 
be held to values of less than two times the limitation in the future. 
(Code 1989, § 1048.09; Ord. No. 967, 12-20-2005) 


Sec. 46-140. - Treatment of information on industrial users. 
(a) ?Provisions regarding the treatment of information and data on an industrial user are as follows: 
(1) ?Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written reports, questionnaires, permit 
applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the 
public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically 
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the release of 
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to 
protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. 
(2) ?When submitted to the department, all information claimed to be confidential must be clearly 
marked "confidential." When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a 
report determined by the department to disclose trade secrets or trade secret processes, and 
which are clearly labeled as confidential, shall not be made available for inspection by the 
public, but shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to 
this division, to the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, and to the 
state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs, provided, however that 
information shall be treated as confidential by the governmental agency, until such time as the 
information has been determined to be nonconfidential by the governmental agency. 
Confidential information on industrial users, which the department releases pursuant to a 
request of another governmental agency, should be handled by the other governmental agency 
pursuant to its own confidentiality procedures. The department cannot control how another 
governmental agency handles such confidential information, and assumes no responsibility for 
the disposition of the information released to the governmental agency. The department will use 
sufficient care to inform the other governmental agency of the existence of the industrial user's 
confidentiality claim. 
(3) ?The department shall determine whether the information requested to be treated as 
confidential, in fact, satisfies the requirements of confidential information as defined herein. The 
decision of the department shall be made in writing. 
(4) ?Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(b) ?Except as otherwise determined by the department or provided for by applicable law, all information 
with respect to an industrial user on file with the city shall be made available upon request by such 
user or the user's authorized representative during normal business hours. 
(Code 1989, § 1048.10; Ord. No. 967, 12-20-2005) 


Sec. 46-141. - Statutes, laws and regulations. 
    The national categorical pretreatment standards defined in 40 CFR 405471, shall be and are 
incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof. Unless otherwise provided, any reference in 
this division to a code, standard, rule, regulation, or law enacted, adopted, established, or promulgated by 
any private organization, or by any element or organization of government other than the city shall be 
construed to apply to such code, standard, rule, regulation, or law in effect or as amended or 
promulgated, from the date of enactment of this division. 
(Code 1989, § 1048.11; Ord. No. 967, 12-20-2005) 


Sec. 46-142. - Enforcement. 
(a) ?Violations. It shall be a violation of this division for any user to: 
(1) ?Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater constituents and/or characteristics of 
the industrial user's discharge; 
(2) ?Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's operations or wastewater constituents 
and/or characteristics within the time frames provided in section 46-137(g)(1); 
(3) ?Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises, waste discharge, or sample 
location for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
(4) ?Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to any monitoring facilities constructed 
on public or private property. The locking or securing of the monitoring facility shall not 
constitute a violation pursuant to this subsection, provided that upon request reasonable access 
to the facility is promptly provided to the department; 
(5) ?Restrict, interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the department's monitoring 
devices including, but not limited to, samplers; 
(6) ?Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial user's wastewater discharge 
permit; 
(7) ?Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of this chapter including any rule, 
regulation, or order issued hereunder. Industrial users acting in full compliance with wastewater 
discharge permits issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is 
derived shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this division, and such 
permits shall remain in effect and be enforceable under this division until a superseding permit 
is effective. Industrial users shall comply with applicable national categorical pretreatment 
standards and requirements on the date specified in the federal regulations, regardless of 
compliance schedules. 
(b) ?Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with 
national categorical pretreatment standards where the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this 
section are met. 
(1) ?An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through 
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
a. ?An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b. ?At the time, the facility was being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in 
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c. ?The industrial user has submitted the following information to the department, orally or in 
writing, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset and where this information is 
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1. ?A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2. ?The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the 
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3. ?Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the 
noncompliance. 
(2) ?In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an 
upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(3) ?The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain 
compliance with this division upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the 
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in 
the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is 
reduced, lost or fails. 
(c) ?Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a violation of pretreatment 
standards or requirements, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of 
the treatment system. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c)(1) and (2) 
of this section. 
(1) ?Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to the 
department at least ten days in advance. 
(2) ?Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated 
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the 
industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. A written submission 
shall be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have 
become aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass, 
including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, a plan to prevent 
reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(3) ?Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and the department may take 
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a. ?The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property 
damage; 
b. ?There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment 
facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment 
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been 
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which 
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c. ?The industrial user properly notified the department as described in subsection (c)(2) of this 
section. 
(4) ?Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (c)(3) of this section, the 
department may approve an anticipated bypass. 
(d) ?Pollution prevention initiatives upon detection of pollutants. Where one or more of the 
measurements taken for any pollutant defined in section 46-135(b) during a six-month period exceed 
by any magnitude the daily maximum nondetect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may 
develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response. The 
department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of 
the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution 
prevention initiatives, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge 
permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six-month intervals, analytical results and certifications in 
support of its implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMP. Upon 
demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation 
requirement. 
(e) ?Emergency suspensions and orders. The department may order suspension of the sewer or 
wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit where, in the opinion of the 
department, such suspension is necessary to stop any actual or threatened discharge which 
presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to 
the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the City of 
Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the 
sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately 
stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the department provides informal notification under 
this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within 24 hours. In the event of a 
failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the department 
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection 
or service, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the 
environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user within 24 
hours in writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any event, the 
department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director, or 
his or her designated representative, within ten days of such action. The industrial user shall submit 
a detailed written statement to the department within 15 days of the occurrence describing the 
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon 
proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the department shall reinstate the wastewater 
discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 
(f) ?Notice of violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened discharge as specified in 
subsection (e) of this section, whenever the department has reason to believe that any industrial 
user has violated or is violating this division, the department shall serve a written notice stating the 
nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the department shall pursue 
appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved enforcement response 
plan. The failure of the department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the department 
from escalating its enforcement response. 
(g) ?Administrative actions. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is 
violating or has violated a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or 
requirement or any prohibition of this division, the department may initiate appropriate administrative 
enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, in order to compel the 
industrial user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 
(1) ?Possible actions to remedy violation. 
a. ?Conferences. The department may order any person who violates this division to attend a 
conference wherein the department may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or 
remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of 
violation shall be served at least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set 
forth the date, time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a 
representative of the department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for 
achieving compliance with this division. Nothing contained herein shall require the 
department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the 
department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection (g)(2) of 
this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule, the user and the 
department's duly authorized representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance 
agreement or an administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An 
industrial user must exhibit good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this division 
and any procedures, requirements, and agreements hereunder. 
b. ?Compliance schedules. The user and the department may agree upon a schedule which 
sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or schedules for completion of actions 
to remedy or to eliminate the causes of violation. These schedules may be developed as 
part of a compliance agreement, and/or an administrative consent order. Schedules 
developed under this subsection shall adhere to the following conditions: 
1. ?The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the 
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and 
operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities, or to the implementation of 
additional operation and maintenance procedures required for the industrial user to 
meet the applicable pretreatment requirements and standards including, but not 
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, 
executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completing 
construction; 
2. ?No single increment referred to in subsection (g)(1)b.1. of this section shall exceed 
nine months; 
3. ?Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for 
compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the department 
including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met 
on such date and, if not, the date which it expects to comply with this increment of 
progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to 
return to the established schedule; and 
4. ?Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the industrial user being 
found in violation of this division. 
c. ?Administrative orders. The department may order any industrial user, who violates or 
continues to violate this division or a duly issued permit, to install and to properly operate 
devices, treatment facilities, or other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may 
contain such other requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to 
address the violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-
monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste minimization 
assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction, and recycling practices to 
reduce the generation or release of pollutants at the facility. An order may be either an 
administrative consent order, which is the result of an agreement, or a unilateral 
administrative order. 
(2) ?Show cause hearing. The department may order any industrial user who violates this division 
or allows such violation to occur to show cause before the department why a proposed 
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served upon the industrial user 
specifying the time and place of a hearing before the department regarding the violation, the 
reason why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the 
industrial user to show cause before the department why any proposed enforcement action 
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally, or by registered or 
certified mail with return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be 
made upon any agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative. 
a. ?Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures 
adopted by the board. A hearings officer shall conduct the show cause hearing and take 
the evidence, and may: 
1. ?In the name of the board, issue notices of hearing requesting the attendance and 
testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved 
in such hearing; 
2. ?Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other 
evidence, together with recommendations to the director for action thereon. 
b. ?Transcript. At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony shall be 
recorded by a court reporter. 
(3) ?Actions. After a show cause hearing has been conducted, the hearings officer shall issue an 
order to the industrial user directing any of the following actions: 
a. ?Immediate compliance with the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit or with any 
applicable limitation, condition, restriction or requirement of this division, or applicable 
local, state or federal law or regulation; 
b. ?Pretreatment of waste by installation of adequate treatment equipment or proper operation 
and maintenance of existing treatment equipment be accomplished within a specified time 
period; 
c. ?Submission of compliance reports on effluent quality and quantity as determined by self-
monitoring and analysis during a specified time period; 
d. ?Submission of periodic reports on effluent quality and quantity determined by self-
monitoring analysis throughout the final period set by a compliance date; 
e. ?Control of discharge quantities; 
f. ?Payment of costs for reasonable and necessary inspection, monitoring, and administration 
of the industrial user's activities by the department during compliance efforts; 
g. ?Any such other orders as are appropriate, including, but not limited to, immediate 
termination of sewer or wastewater treatment services, or revocation of a wastewater 
discharge permit, or orders directing that following a specified time period sewer or 
wastewater treatment service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, 
devices, or operation and maintenance practices have been employed; 
h. ?A finding that the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that a 
violation either of this division or of a duly issued permit did not occur. 
(4) ?Public notification of significant noncompliance. The department shall publish in the largest 
daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit and the list of all industrial users which were in 
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the 
previous 12 months. All industrial users identified in a proposed publication shall be provided 
with a copy of the proposed notice at least 30 days before publication and allowed an 
opportunity to comment as to its accuracy. 
(h) ?Legal actions. 
(1) ?Criminal action. Any user who violates any provision of this division, including the failure to pay 
any fees, fines, charges or surcharges imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit 
issued pursuant thereto, or who knowingly makes any false statements, representatives or 
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be 
maintained pursuant to this division or wastewater discharge permit, or who tampers with or 
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device required under this division, is guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each 
violation per day, or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or by both. The department is 
hereby authorized, through its counsel, to seek prosecution of criminal charges against any 
person violating any provision of this division. 
(2) ?Civil action. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is 
violating or has violated a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard 
or requirement or any requirement of this division, the director may commence a civil action to 
compel compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from discharging, 
and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The department or board may also 
seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The commencement of suit neither constitutes an 
exclusive election of remedies nor prohibits the department, director, board, or City of Detroit 
from commencing action in federal court for discharges believed to be in violation of this 
chapter, state and federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the City of Detroit's 
NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or requirements. In addition, the City of Detroit may 
recover the reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reporters' fees, and other unusual 
expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to have violated 
this division, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
(3) ?Fines, costs, penalties. All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of 
competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.

Sec. 46-143. - Reconsideration and appeal. 
    Through the procedures of reconsideration and appeal, a user may contest actions, determinations, 
or decisions of the department which result from its construction, application and enforcement of this 
division. The procedures contained within this section govern reconsideration and appeal with respect to 
construction, application, and enforcement of this division. 
(1) ?Selection of reconsideration or of appeal. 
a. ?Except for those actions, determinations, or decisions which are expressly identified as 
subject only to appeal, reconsideration may be requested by any permit applicant, 
permittee, authorized industrial wastewater discharger or other discharger, who is 
adversely affected by any action, determination, or decision that is made by, or on behalf 
of, the department by the director, or an authorized representative, and that interprets, 
implements or enforces the provisions of this division. 
b. ?An appeal may be requested by any permit applicant, permittee, authorized industrial 
wastewater discharge or other discharger, who is adversely affected by a permit issued as 
final by the department, or by an administrative order entered after a show cause order and 
hearing, or after a hearing for reconsideration. 
c. ?Unless otherwise expressly provided for by this article, a request for reconsideration or 
appeal must be signed by an authorized representative, and received at the department's 
general offices within 20 days from the date of the occurrence of the action, determination, 
or decision in dispute. A request for reconsideration shall contain the requester's name and 
address, a brief statement of the reason, and the factual basis underlying the request. 
d. ?A request for reconsideration shall be filed in triplicate either by hand delivery or by certified 
mail to the general offices of the department. Where a request for reconsideration or 
appeal either is not filed within the time period provided for in this subsection or is 
improperly made, the action, determination or decision of the director, or the department's 
authorized representative, is final and any right to reconsideration appeal may be deemed 
waived. 
(2) ?Reconsideration. Within 15 days after receipt of a timely and proper request for 
reconsideration, the department shall notify the applicant of the time and place for a hearing. 
a. ?A hearing for reconsideration shall be conducted by a hearings officer who is designated by 
the director and may be an employee of the department. The decision of the hearing officer 
shall be in the form of a recommendation to the director and embodied in an administrative 
order. Except for an administrative consent order that was negotiated and agreed to by 
both parties, an administrative order is appealable in accordance with subsection (c) of this 
section. 
b. ?Where improperly or untimely submitted, the department may reject a request for 
reconsideration. The department shall notify the requester in writing that the request has 
been rejected. 
c. ?Unless the date is mutually extended by both parties, the hearing shall be conducted 
neither less than ten days nor more than 30 days after mailing of the notice. For cause and 
at the discretion of the hearing officer, the hearing may be continued for a reasonable time. 
d. ?The hearing for reconsideration shall be an informal consultation and conference where the

(Code 1989, § 1050.02; Ord. No. 920, 12-17-2002; Ord. No. 929, 6-17-2003; Ord. No. 944, 6-
29-2004; Ord. No. 961, 6-21-2005; Ord. No. 974, 6-27-2006; Ord. No. 992, 7-3-2007; Ord. No. 
1001, § 1050.02, 7-1-2008; Ord. No. 1014, 9-1-2009; Ord. No. 1026, 7-6-2010; Ord. No. 1071,

No. 1125, 6-16-2015; Ord. No. 1140, § 4, 6-20-2017) 


Sec. 46-167. - Meter reading; billing and collection. 
    All meters shall be read at least quarterly. Bills for water service and sewage disposal service shall 
be due and payable when rendered. There shall be added to all bills not paid on or before the 21st day of 
the month following the billing a penalty of five percent of the amount of the bill. An additional penalty of 
one percent per month shall be added for each additional month that the bill has not been paid. The 
director of the department of public works and service shall have charge of the reading of all meters. He 
or she shall keep a record of all meter readings, shall keep accounts of the charges for water and sewer 
service furnished to all premises and shall render bills for the same. All water and sewer service charges 
shall be collected by the director of finance, who shall credit the same to the proper account. 
(Code 1989, § 1050.03; Ord. No. 827, 10-11-1994) 


Sec. 46-168. - Enforcement. 
    The department of public works and service is hereby authorized to enforce payment of charges for 
sewage disposal service to any premises by discontinuing either the water service or the sewage disposal 
service to such premises, or both, and an action of assumpsit may be instituted by the city against the 
customer. The charges for water service and sewage disposal service, which, under the provisions of 
Public Act No. 94 of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), are made a lien on the premises to which they are 
furnished, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien, and the city shall, annually, on December 1, 
certify all unpaid charges for such services furnished to any premises which, on the November 30 
preceding, have remained unpaid for a period of six months, to the city assessor, who shall place the 
same on the next tax roll of the city. Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as 
general city taxes. In cases where the city is properly notified, in accordance with Public Act No. 94 of 
1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), that a tenant is responsible for sewage disposal service charges, no such 
service shall be commenced or continued to such premises until there has been deposited with the 
department a sum sufficient to cover twice the average quarterly bill for such premises as estimated by 
the city. Where the water service to any premises is turned off to enforce the payment of sewage disposal 
service charges, the water service shall not be recommenced until all delinquent charges have been paid 
and a deposit as in the case of tenants is made, and there shall be a water turn-on charge in an amount 
as adopted by the city council from time to time. In any other case where, in the discretion of the city, the 
collection of charges for water or sewage disposal service may be difficult or uncertain, the city may 
require a similar deposit. Such deposits may be applied against any delinquent water or sewage disposal 
service charges of the depositor, and the application thereof shall not affect the right of the department to 
turn off the water service and/or sewer service to any premises to satisfy any delinquency. No such 
deposit shall bear interest. Such deposit, or any remaining balance thereof, shall be returned to the 
customer making the same when he or she discontinues receiving water and sewage disposal service or, 
except as to tenants as to whom notice of responsibility for such charges has been filed with the city, 
when any eight successive quarterly bills have been paid by such customer with no delinquency. 
(Code 1989, § 1050.04) 


Sec. 46-169. - Findings. 
(a) ?Necessity for sewage disposal. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that 
the use of septic tanks, privies, privy vaults, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal facilities, is 
deleterious to the health, safety and welfare of the businesses, industries, governmental and 
charitable agencies, and residents of the city and that the health, safety and welfare of the 
businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies and residents is enhanced by the 
creation of a public sewer system and treatment plant, with regulation by the city of pollutants and 
other harmful materials according to state and federal standards. 
(b) ?Method for measuring use; sewage disposal services. Based on advice of its engineers, the city 
council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the most practical, cost effective and 
accurate method, given available technology, of measuring the use of the system's sewers by any 
user is by the meter used to measure water usage. 
(c) ?Continuation of service. The city council has previously found, and further currently reaffirms that, in 
order to provide and continue to provide for the safe and uninterrupted removal and treatment of 
sewage, pollutants and other harmful materials, it is necessary from time to time to install 
improvements, enlargements, extensions and repairs to the system's sewers and sewer service 
pipes. 
(d) ?Purpose of charges. The charges and fees for the use of and connection to the system are hereby 
established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, 
repair, and operation of the system and to comply with federal and state safe drinking water acts and 
related regulations, to provide for the payment principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to 
be issued as and when the same become due and payable, to create a bond and interest 
redemption fund therefor, to provide a fund for reasonable and necessary improvements to the 
system and to provide for such other funds as are necessary to meet contractual obligations of the 
issuer. Such charges and fees shall be made in accordance with the purposes herein described as 
well as the following: 
(1) ?All premises connected directly or indirectly to the system, except as hereinafter provided, shall 
be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this 
division. 
(2) ?The charges, rates and fees for sewer service by the system are established herein to 
adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system does not operate at a 
deficit. 
(3) ?The system staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges, rates, fees, rules 
and regulations of the system, which review shall be completed not less than one time per fiscal 
year. Results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any 
adjustments. 
(4) ?The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable 
proportion to the cost of serving those users. 
(e) ?Proportionality, fairness, and benefits of charges, rates and fees. 
(1) ?The city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most 
reasonable method of providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and 
improvement of the system is to charge each user, based in all cases on amount of use, for the 
costs of: 
a. ?Retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements 
and replacements to the system; 
b. ?Ongoing repair, replacement and improvement budgeted as part of the annual costs of the 
system; and 
c. ?Operation, administration and maintenance costs of the system. 
(2) ?The city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the sewage disposal 
service provided by the system. Based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers, 
the city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that to ensure the stability and 
viability of the system for the benefit of its users, the fairest and most accurate way to apportion 
the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and improvement of the system is to charge 
each user: 
a. ?A separate capital connection charge for sewage disposal service when such user's 
property is first connected to the system; 
b. ?A monthly service charge for sewage disposal service, which varies depending on the size 
of the water intake pipe and meter, which charge reflects each user's proportionate share 
of the fixed costs of the system; and 
c. ?A commodity charge for sewage disposal usage which is based on the user's actual use of 
water supplied by the system. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms 
that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable 
costs of the system among the users of the system and that the capital connection charge, 
the monthly service charge and the commodity charge each provide actual benefits to such 
users in the form of ready access to water service that would be unavailable if such 
charges were not charged. 
(3) ?In addition to the findings set forth above, the city council has previously found and currently 
reaffirms that the capital connection charges reflect the proportional capital costs of the system, 
previously paid by the city and the system, attributable to each new user and that the 
opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or 
greater than the amount of such charges.

DIVISION 5. - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SEWER RATES 


Sec. 46-191. - Purpose and objective. 
    The purpose of this division is to protect the public health and safety. Further, because of the widely 
varying quality characteristics of the sewage discharged by different users of the public sewer and the 
publicly owned treatment works, it is the objective of this division to impose sewage charges which reflect 
the cost of treating sewage strength factors as well as sewage volume. These charges to commercial and 
industrial users will be in the form of a payment called a surcharge and will reflect industries' equitable 
costs of wastewater treatment in excess of the strength of domestic sewage. Sewage charges will be 
based on a volume rate and surcharges will be based on volume of discharge and the strength of BOD, 
suspended solids and phosphorus or other pollutants present in the wastewater. If other pollutants are 
required to be surcharged under this division, under authorized variances or by special arrangement with 
the owner of the publicly owned treatment works, the rules and regulations adopted herein will apply, 
such rules and regulations to be on file with the city clerk.

Sec. 46-194. - Schedule of surcharges. 
    The Schedule of Industrial Waste Pollutant Strength Surcharges is hereby adopted and made 
effective for users of the wastewater system of the city. Such surcharges shall be computed as follows: 
COMPUTATION OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE 
POLLUTANT STRENGTH SURCHARGE 
    The industrial waste pollutant strength surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the following 
formula: 
SC = 0.0624 V a (BOD-250) + b (TSS-300) + c (P-12) 
where: 
SC = Pollutant strength surcharge fee in dollars for the billing period. 
V = Volume of waste discharge in billing period in Mcf (1,000 cubic feet). 
BOD = Five-day biochemical oxygen demand of the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/l). 
where: 
TSS = Total suspended solids in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/l). 
P = Phosphorus in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/l). 
a, b, c = Surcharge rates, $/pound for treating BOD, TSS and P, respectively. 
0.0624 = Factor which converts Mcf to MM lbs. 
a = as currently established or as hereafter adopted by the city council from time to time. 
b = as currently established or as hereafter adopted by the city council from time to time. 
c = as currently established or as hereafter adopted by the city council from time to time. 
    For purposes of surcharge computation, the values of pollutant strengths shall not be less than the 
allowable values, as follows: 
BOD - 250 
TSS - 300 
P - 12 
    The total sewerage charge for a particular industry would be the sum of the base flow charge and the 
surcharge would be calculated from the following formula: 
UC = V (R) + SC 
where: 
UC = Total sewerage charge for the billing period in dollar. 
V = Volume of waste discharged in billing period of Mcf. 
R = Basic flow sewage rate is as currently established or as hereafter adopted by the city council 
from time to time. 
SC = Surcharge in dollars as computed above.

Sec. 46-216. - General requirements. 
    The following general stormwater management requirements apply to all new developments and 
redevelopments in City of Eastpointe. 
(a) ?The design process shall begin by identifying sensitive areas located on the site and laying out the 
site to protect the sensitive areas. 
(b) ?Best management practices (BMPs) that reduce the amount of stormwater runoff and improve water 
quality are required and shall be designed on a site specific basis. All BMPs shall be included on the 
plans and will be subject to review and approval by the appropriate government agency such as the 
City of Eastpointe, the Macomb County Public Works Office (MCPWO) and the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) as necessary for permits. 
    During construction, all sites that disturb one or more acres of land, or are located within 500 feet of 
waters of the state, BMP usage shall be monitored and recorded in the weekly soil erosion sedimentation 
control (SESC) reports. Land uses with potential for significant pollutant loading, including but not limited 
to: gas stations, commercial vehicle maintenance and repair, auto recyclers, recycling centers, and scrap 
yards, will require BMPs which address regulation of the specific hazard as determined by the MCPWO or 
the city engineer. In such cases, weekly SESC reports shall also be required during construction. 
    The developer/owner shall include a long-term operation and maintenance schedule for all 
permanent BMPs. A maintenance agreement between the developer/owner and the city is necessary for 
permanent BMPs which shall include, but not be limited to: inspection of structural or vegetative BMPs, 
performance of maintenance and corrective actions when BMPs are neglected by the owner, and deed 
restrictions. All such maintenance agreements shall be binding on the property and shall remain in effect 
in the event the property ownership is transferred or sold. 
(c) ?Onsite management of stormwater is required first and foremost, unless site constraints, as 
determined by the city engineer, preclude this approach. 
(d) ?Stormwater shall be managed using three standards: flood control, water quality, and pre-treatment 
to protect both water resources and real property. 
(e) ?Flood control shall be provided for all sites through retention or detention. On-site detention or 
retention of stormwater is required of all new developments or redevelopments to maintain the peak 
outflow to a rate similar to the pre-development runoff rate. 
(f) ?Overland flow routes and the extent of high water levels for the 100-year storm shall be identified for 
all sites. 
(g) ?Water quality treatment shall be provided for all sites. A minimum treatment volume equal to one 
inch of runoff from the directly contributing impervious area is required. A minimum volume of 900 
cubic feet per acre is required for directly connected disturbed pervious areas (i.e., lawns). BMPs 
shall be designed to reduce post development solids loadings by 80 percent or to not exceed solids 
loadings of 80 milligrams per liter. Developments that disturb less than one acre, and are not part of 
a larger common plan of development or sale may be exempted from the city's water quality 
treatment standards as approved by the city engineer. 
(h) ?Pre-treatment is required for infiltration, filtration and detention BMPs for ease of maintenance and 
to protect BMP integrity and preserve longevity. 
(i) ?Stormwater discharges from activities with a high risk for an accidental spill of pollutants (stormwater 
hot spots) shall provide spill containment. 
(j) ?The design maximum release rate, volume or concentration of stormwater discharged from a site 
shall not exceed the capacity of existing infrastructure or cause impairment to the offsite receiving 
area. Evaluation of the existing outlet must be performed and an adequate outlet must be provided. 
(k) ?The use of many decentralized low impact development (LID) BMPs is not mandated, but is 
encouraged on private sites. 
(l) ?Unless otherwise noted, hydraulic and hydrologic calculations (including rainfall volumes and 
distributions) shall be based on current MDEQ standards and procedures in place at the time of 
application. 
(m) ?Construction plans for a phased development shall show the existing and/or proposed drainage 
systems for all prior phases of the development, unless the drainage system for the current phase is 
entirely independent of the prior phases. Furthermore, drainage plans for a phase of a development 
must not be dependent upon work planned to be performed in a future phase. 
(n) ?Plans shall include a grading plan showing existing and proposed topographic contour lines and 
proposed finish floor and basement floor elevations. 
(o) ?All existing natural or manmade drains shall be shown on the plans. The proposed changes to the 
site must not interfere with common law natural flow rights. Existing drains must be preserved or 
relocated, or the flow otherwise accommodated by the proposed plans. Provisions for the 
maintenance of the drain must be included in the deed restriction or an equivalent legally binding 
agreement. MDEQ and/or the Army Corps of Engineers may also require permits for changes made 
to such drains. 
(p) ?The cover sheet of the plans shall include a "permit status table" indicating the status of all permits 
being obtained. 
(q) ?If an established county drain is involved, construction plans shall include a note indicating that "All 
work performed in the right-of-way of an established drain shall require a permit from the Macomb 
County Public Works Commissioner." 
(r) ?The engineer's seal shall be affixed to just the cover sheet of the construction plans. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-217. - Established drains. 
    No construction activities shall be allowed without approval from the Macomb County Public Works 
Commissioner for any development directly discharging to an established county drain. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-218. - Storm sewers. 
(a) ?Plans shall show boundaries and acreages of catchment areas contributing runoff to each proposed 
or existing catch basin and/or inlet. Runoff from off-site tributary areas must be accommodated in 
design or rerouted.

method. 
(1) ?A ten-year design storm shall be used such that rainfall intensity, I = 175 / (T + 25), where T = 
time of concentration in minutes. 
(2) ?The runoff coefficient, C, shall be in conformance with normal design practice. Where a 
weighted average coefficient is employed, the computations shall be submitted for review.

submitted for review. 
(1) ?Sewer capacities shall be based on the Manning equation. 
(2) ?Energy losses from friction shall be based on calculated design storm peak discharges and 
velocities, not Manning design (i.e., full-pipe) capacities. 
(3) ?Energy losses through manholes and other appurtenances shall be included in the design 
calculations OR reflected in friction losses through use of conservative Manning "n" roughness 
values as approved by the city engineer.

Maximum allowable pipe velocity shall be ten ft./sec. 
(f) ?Hydraulic grade lines for the ten-year storm shall be calculated and shown as a part of all storm 
sewer profiles. In no case shall the elevation of the hydraulic grade line exceed the elevation of a 
point lying one foot below the rim elevation of a manhole, catch basin or inlet. The hydraulic grade 
line upstream of a detention or retention storage facility shall be calculated assuming the design high 
water elevation (e.g., full detention basin). 
(g) ?The storm sewer plan and profile drawing shall show the following data: 
(1) ?Proper identification and numbering of manholes, catch basins and inlets; 
(2) ?Invert and casting elevations for all structures; 
(3) ?Pipe length (C/L to C/L to structures); 
(4) ?Pipe diameter; 
(5) ?Pipe slope; 
(6) ?Pipe class or designation; 
(7) ?Detail of trench construction and type of backfill material. 
(h) ?Generally, manholes shall be placed not more than 300 feet apart for sewers less than 30 inches 
diameter and 600 feet apart for larger sewers. 
(i) ?The minimum inside diameter of all manholes, catch basins and inlets shall be 48 inches, with the 
following exception: Inlet structures from which water will be discharged directly into a catch basin 
may be 24 inches inside diameter. The depth of such inlets shall be no greater 5.0 feet and no less 
than 3.5 feet from the top of frame and cover to the invert. 
(j) ?Manholes and inlets structures may be constructed of brick, manhole block, precast concrete (ASTM 
C478) or cast-in-place concrete. 
(k) ?All manhole block or brick structures shall be plastered on the outside with one to 2.5 mix of 
portland cement mortar, one-half inch thick. No calcium chloride or other chemical shall be added to 
lower the freezing point of the mortar, as the strength of the mortar may be lessened. 
(l) ?Inlet structures in the public street right-of-way shall be spaced a maximum of 400 feet apart (or a 
maximum of 400 feet on either side of a high point). The spacing and/or number of inlet structures 
required to accommodate the design flows in streets and in private drives and parking areas, shall be 
based on a maximum of one cfs per 90 square inches of opening in an inlet or catch basin cover. 
(m) ?All storm sewer pipe, manholes, catch basins, and inlets shall meet MDOT specifications.

avoided. 
(o) ?Where drainage is discharged to an established drain, such outlets shall be so designed as to enter 
the drain at an angle of 90 degrees or less, as determined by the upstream centerline. 
(p) ?Unless the storm sewers are to be owned and maintained by a single private entity (i.e., municipal 
or commercial development, manufactured housing community, etc.), all storm sewers shall be 
located within an easement. The minimum easement width for a storm sewer shall be 12 feet 
centered on the sewer centerline. 
(q) ?All existing and proposed on-site drainage easements shall be clearly shown. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-219. - Bioretention. 
    A bioretention system consists of a soil bed planted with native vegetation located above an 
underdrained sand layer. It can be configured as either a bioretention structure or a bioretention swale. 
Stormwater runoff entering the bioretention system is filtered first through the vegetation and then the 
sand/soil mixture before being conveyed downstream by the underdrain system. Runoff storage depths 
above the planting bed surface are typically shallow. The adopted TSS removal rate for bioretention 
systems is 90 percent. 
    Bioretention systems are used to remove a wide range of pollutants, such as suspended solids, 
nutrients, metals, hydrocarbons, and bacteria from stormwater runoff. They can also be used to reduce 
peak runoff rates and increase stormwater infiltration when designed as a multi-stage, multi-function 
facility. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-219.1. - Pre-design site evaluation. 
    For infiltration trench and structure practices, a minimum field infiltration rate (fc) of 0.52 inches per 
hour is required; lower rates preclude the use of these practices. For surface sand filter and bioretention 
practices, no minimum infiltration rate is required if these facilities are designed with a "day-lighting" 
underdrain system; otherwise these facilities require a 0.52 inch per hour rate. 
    Feasibility testing is to be conducted to screen unsuitable sites, and reduce testing costs. A soil 
boring is not required at this stage. However, a designer or landowner may opt to engage concept design 
borings at his discretion, without feasibility testing. 
    Initial testing involves either one field test per facility, regardless of type or size, or previous testing 
data, such as the following: 
? On-site septic percolation testing, within 200 feet of the proposed BMP location, and on the same 
contour which can establish initial rate, water table and/or depth to bedrock; 
? Geotechnical report on the site prepared by a qualified geotechnical consultant; or 
? Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) County Soil Mapping showing an unsuitable soil 
group such as a hydrologic group "D" soil in a low-lying area. 
    If the results of initial feasibility testing as determined by a qualified professional show that an 
infiltration rate of greater than 0.52 inches per hour is probable, then the number of concept design test 
pits shall be per the following table. An encased soil boring may be substituted for a test pit, if desired. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-219.2. - Design criteria. 
(a) ?Storage volume, depth, and duration. Bioretention systems shall be designed to treat the runoff 
volume generated by the stormwater quality design storm (two-year). The maximum water depth 
during treatment of the stormwater quality design storm shall be 12 inches in a bioretention structure 
and 18 inches in a bioretention swale. The minimum diameter of any outlet or overflow orifice is 2.5 
inches. The bottom of a bioretention system, including any underdrain piping or gravel layer, must be 
a minimum of one foot above the seasonal high groundwater table. The planting soil bed and 
underdrain system shall be designed to fully drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume 
within 72 hours. 
(b) ?Permeability rates . The design permeability rate through the planting soil bed must be sufficient to 
fully drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 hours. This permeability rate 
must be determined by field or laboratory testing. Since the actual permeability rate may vary from 
test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation of 
sediments removed from the treated stormwater, a factor of safety of two shall be applied to the 
tested permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate. Therefore, if the tested 
permeability rate of the soil bed material is four inches/hour, the design rate would be two 
inches/hour (i.e., four inches per hour/2). This design rate would then be used to compute the 
system's stormwater quality design storm drain time. 
(c) ?Planting soil bed. The planting soil bed provides the environment for water and nutrients to be made 
available to the vegetation. The soil particles can adsorb some additional pollutants through cation 
exchange, and voids within the soil particles can store a portion of the stormwater quality design 
storm runoff volume. The planting soil bed material should consist of ten to 15 percent clays, a 
minimum 65 percent sands, with the balance as silts. The material's pH should range from 5.5 to 6.5. 
The material shall be placed in 12 to 18 inch lifts. The total depth or thickness of the planting soil bed 
should be a minimum of three feet. As noted above, the design permeability rate of the soil bed 
material must be sufficient to drain the stormwater quality design storm runoff volume within 72 
hours. Filter fabric should be placed along the sides of the planting soil bed to prevent the migration 
of soil particles from the adjacent soil into the planting soil bed. 
(d) ?Vegetation . The vegetation in a bioretention system removes some of the nutrients and other 
pollutants in the stormwater inflow. The use of native plant material is recommended for bioretention 
systems wherever possible. The goal of the planting plan should be to simulate a forest-shrub 
community of primarily upland type. In general, trees should dominate the perimeter zone that is 
subject to less frequent inundation. Shrubs and herbaceous species that are adapted to moister 
conditions and expected pollutant loads should be selected for the wetter zones. The number of 
stems per acre should average 1,000, with tree spacing of 12 feet and shrub spacing of eight feet. 
(e) ?Sand layer. The sand layer serves as a transition between the planting soil bed and the gravel layer 
and underdrain pipes. It shall be a minimum thickness of 12 inches and consist of clean medium 
aggregate sand (AASSHTO M-6/ASTM C-33 or MDOT Class II). To ensure proper system operation, 
the sand layer must have a permeability rate at least twice as fast as the design permeability rate of 
the planting soil bed. 
(f) ?Underdrain . The underdrain piping must be rigid Schedule 40 PVC pipe. The portion of drain piping 
beneath the planting soil bed and sand layer must be perforated. All remaining underdrain piping, 
including cleanouts, must be nonperforated. All joints must be secure and watertight. The underdrain 
piping must connect to a downstream storm sewer manhole, catch structure, channel, swale, or 
ground surface at a location that is not subject to blockage by debris or sediment and is readily 
accessible for inspection and maintenance. Blind connections to downstream storm sewers are 
prohibited. 
(g) ?Overflows . All bioretention systems must be able to safely convey system overflows to downstream 
drainage systems. The capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the remainder of the site's 
drainage system and sufficient to provide safe, stable discharge of stormwater in the event of an 
overflow. 
(h) ?Tailwater . The hydraulic design of the underdrain and overflow systems, as well as any stormwater 
quantity control outlets, must consider any significant tailwater effects of downstream waterways or 
facilities. This includes instances where the lowest invert in the outlet or overflow structure is below 
the flood hazard area design flood elevation of a receiving stream. 
(i) ?Maintenance . The following requirements must be included in the system's maintenance plan. 
(1) ?General maintenance. All bioretention system components expected to receive and/or trap 
debris and sediment must be inspected for clogging and excessive debris and sediment 
accumulation at least four times annually as well as after every storm exceeding one inch of 
rainfall. Such components may include bottoms, trash racks, low flow channels, outlet 
structures, riprap or gabion aprons, and cleanouts. 
Sediment removal should take place when the structure is thoroughly dry. Disposal of debris, 
trash, sediment, and other waste material should be done at suitable disposal/recycling sites 
and in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal waste regulations. 
(2) ?Vegetated areas . Mowing and/or trimming of vegetation must be performed on a regular 
schedule based on city code enforcement standards. Vegetated areas must be inspected at 
least annually for erosion and scour. Vegetated areas should also be inspected at least annually 
for unwanted growth, which should be removed with minimum disruption to the planting soil bed 
and remaining vegetation. 
When establishing or restoring vegetation, biweekly inspections of vegetation health should be 
performed during the first growing season or until the vegetation is established. Once 
established, inspections of vegetation health, density, and diversity should be performed at least 
twice annually during both the growing and non-growing seasons. The vegetative cover should 
be maintained at 85 percent. If vegetation has greater than 50 percent damage, the area should 
be reestablished in accordance with the original specifications and the inspection requirements 
presented above. 
All use of fertilizers, mechanical treatments, pesticides and other means to assure optimum 
vegetation health should not compromise the intended purpose of the bioretention system. All 
vegetation deficiencies should be addressed without the use of fertilizers and pesticides 
whenever possible. 
(3) ?Structural components. All structural components must be inspected for cracking, subsidence, 
spalling, erosion, and deterioration at least annually. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-220. - Infiltration. 
    An infiltration structure is a facility constructed within highly permeable soils that provides temporary 
storage of stormwater runoff. An infiltration structure does not normally have a structural outlet to 
discharge runoff from the stormwater quality design storm. Instead, outflow from an infiltration structure is 
through the surrounding soil. An infiltration structure may also be combined with an extended detention 
structure to provide additional runoff storage for both stormwater quality and quantity management. The 
adopted TSS removal rate for infiltration structures is 80 percent. 
    Infiltration structures are used to remove pollutants and to infiltrate stormwater back into the ground. 
Such infiltration also helps to reduce increases in both the peak rate and total volume of runoff caused by 
land development. Pollutant removal is achieved through filtration of the runoff through the soil as well as 
biological and chemical activity within the soil. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-220.1. - Pre-design site evaluation. 
    Infiltration structures can present some practical design problems. When planning for an infiltration 
structure that provides stormwater quality treatment, consideration should be given to soil characteristics, 
depth to the groundwater table, sensitivity of the region, and runoff water quality. Specifically, infiltration 
structures must not be used in the following locations: 
? Industrial and commercial areas where solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded, unloaded, 
stored, or applied or pesticides are loaded, unloaded, or stored. 
? Areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than "reportable 
quantities" as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Code of Federal 
Regulations at 40 CFR 302.4. 
? Areas where infiltration structure use would be inconsistent with an NJDEP-approved remedial 
action work plan or landfill closure plan. 
? Areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance 
facilities. 
? Areas where industrial stormwater runoff is exposed to "source material." "Source material" 
means any material(s) or machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is directly or indirectly 
related to process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities, that could be a source of pollutants in 
any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materials include, but are not limited to 
raw materials, intermediate products, final products, waste materials, by-products, industrial 
machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are related to process, 
manufacturing, or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater. 
? Areas where their installation would create a significant risk for basement seepage or flooding, 
cause surficial flooding of groundwater, or interfere with the operation of subsurface sewage disposal 
systems and other subsurface structures. Such adverse impacts must be assessed and avoided by 
the design engineer. 
    Infiltration structures must be configured and located where their construction will not compact the 
soils below the structure. In addition, an infiltration structure must not be placed into operation until the 
contributing drainage area is completely stabilized. 
    Minimal setback requirements for infiltration structures:

    Soils are perhaps the most important consideration for site suitability. In general, county soil surveys 
can be used to obtain necessary soil data for the planning and preliminary design of infiltration structures. 
For final design and construction, soil tests are required at the exact location of a proposed structure in 
order to confirm its ability to function without failure. 
    Tests should include: 
? Determination of the textural classification; 
? Permeability of the subgrade soil at and below the bottom of the proposed infiltration structure. 
    The recommended minimum depth for subgrade soil analysis is five feet below the bottom of the 
structure or to the groundwater table. Soil permeability testing can be conducted in accordance with the 
standards for individual subsurface sewage disposal systems. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-220.2. - Design criteria. 
(a) ?Storage volume, depth, and duration. An infiltration structure must be designed to treat the total 
runoff volume generated by the structure's maximum design storm. This may either be the 
groundwater recharge or stormwater quality design storm, depending upon the structure's proposed 
use. An infiltration structure must also fully drain this runoff volume within 72 hours. Runoff storage 
for greater times can render the structure ineffective and may result in anaerobic conditions, odor, 
and both water quality and mosquito breeding problems. The bottom of the infiltration structure must 
be at least two feet above seasonal high water table or bedrock. For surface structures, this distance 
must be measured from the bottom of the sand layer. The structure bottom must be as level as 
possible to uniformly distribute runoff infiltration over the subgrade soils. 
    To enhance safety by minimizing standing water depths, the vertical distance between the structure 
bottom and the maximum design storm water surface in surface infiltration structures should be no 
greater than two feet. Construction of an infiltration structure must be done without compacting the 
structure's subgrade soils. Excavation must be performed by equipment placed outside the structure 
whenever possible. This requirement should be considered when designing the dimensions and total 
storage volume of an infiltration structure. It is important to note that the use of infiltration structures is 
recommended only for the stormwater quality design storm and smaller storm events. Use of infiltration 
structures for larger storm events and the requirements by which such structures are to be designed, 
constructed, and maintained should be reviewed and approved by all applicable reviewing agencies. 
(b) ?Permeability rates. The minimum design permeability rate of the soils below an infiltration structure 
will depend upon the structure's location and maximum design storm. The use of infiltration 
structures for stormwater quality control is feasible only where soil is sufficiently permeable to allow a 
reasonable rate of infiltration. Therefore, infiltration structures designed for storms greater than the 
groundwater recharge storm can be constructed only in areas with hydrologic soil group A and B 
soils.

    In addition to the above, the design permeability rate of the soil must be sufficient to fully drain the 
infiltration structure's maximum design storm runoff volume within 72 hours. This design permeability rate 
must be determined by field testing (see Bioretention Pre Design). Since the actual permeability rate may 
vary from test results and may also decrease over time due to soil bed consolidation or the accumulation 
of sediments removed from the treated stormwater, a factor of safety of two must be applied to the tested 
permeability rate to determine the design permeability rate. Therefore, if the tested permeability rate of 
the soils is four inches/hour, the design rate would be two inches/hour (i.e., four inches per hour/2). This 
design rate would then be used to compute the structure's maximum design storm drain time. 
(c) ?Bottom sand layer. To help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over time, a six-inch 
layer of sand must be placed on the bottom of an infiltration structure. This sand layer can intercept 
silt, sediment, and debris that could otherwise clog the top layer of the soil below the structure. The 
sand layer will also facilitate silt, sediment, and debris removal from the structure and can be readily 
restored following removal operations. The sand layer must meet the specifications of a MDOT Class 
II sand. This must be certified by a certified testing lab. 
(d) ?Overflows . All infiltration structures must be able to convey overflows to downstream drainage 
systems in a safe and stable manner. The capacity of the overflow must be consistent with the 
remainder of the site's drainage system and sufficient to provide safe, stable discharge of stormwater 
in the event of an overflow. 
(e) ?Subsurface infiltration structures. A subsurface infiltration structure is located entirely below the 
ground surface. It may consist of a vault, perforated pipe, and/or stone bed. However, due to the 
greater difficulty in removing silt, sediment, and debris, all runoff to a subsurface infiltration structure 
must be pretreated. This pretreatment must remove 80 percent of the TSS in the runoff from the 
structure's maximum design storm. 
(f) ?Basis of design. The design of an infiltration basin is based upon Darcy's Law: 
Q = KIA 
where: 
Q = the rate of infiltration in cubic feet per second (cfs) 
K = the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in feet per second (fps) 
I = the hydraulic gradient 
A = the area of infiltration in square feet (sf) 
From the variables shown in the figure below: 
Average hydraulic gradient = D avg /d 
Minimum hydraulic gradient = D 1 /d 
Maximum hydraulic gradient = D 2 /d 
 
(g) ?Maintenance . The following requirements must be included in the system's maintenance plan. 
    General Maintenance 
    All infiltration structure components expected to receive and/or trap debris and sediment must be 
inspected for clogging and excessive debris and sediment accumulation at least four times annually as 
well as after every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall. Such components may include bottoms, riprap or 
gabion aprons, and inflow points. This applies to both surface and subsurface infiltration structures. 
Sediment removal should take place when the structure is thoroughly dry. Disposal of debris, trash, 
sediment, and other waste material should be done at suitable disposal/recycling sites and in compliance 
with all applicable local, state, and federal waste regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-221. - Detention storage facilities. 
    Detention storage facilities are designed to detain runoff for a short period of time and then release it 
to a watercourse where it returns to the hydrologic cycle. The objective of detention storage is to regulate 
the released runoff rate and to reduce the impact on downstream drainage systems. Detention storage 
should not be confused with retention storage (i.e., retention basins), a facility with no engineered outlet 
(other than an emergency-type outlet) designed to hold runoff for a considerable length of time. The water 
in a retention basin is not discharged to surface water, although it may infiltrate in to the ground, 
evaporate, or be consumed by plants. 
    In keeping with Common Law Natural Flow Rights and the Michigan Drain Code, concentrated 
discharges of stormwater (such as the outflow from a detention facility) or increased surface water runoff 
over property owned by others must be pursuant to a valid right-of-way, easement, or other written 
permission from all property owners affected. The outflow from a detention facility is considered to be 
such a concentrated discharge of stormwater. 
    All forms of detention storage shall meet the following criteria: 
(1) ?On-site detention (or retentionSee Section 4.9 Retention Basin below) of stormwater is 
required of all new developments or redevelopments to maintain the peak outflow to a rate 
similar to the pre-development runoff rate. In no case shall the outflow from a site exceed the 
capacity of the receiving drain to accept the flow. 
(2) ?For development sites greater than five acres, the detention basin volume shall be determined 
for the 100-year flood volume from all tributary area, including off-site area. 
a. ?The tributary area shall include all acreage contributing runoff to the detention storage 
facility, including any off-site tributary area in its existing state, whether developed or 
undeveloped. 
b. ?The following equations shall be used to determine the 100-year detention volume: 
Q a = Allowable release rate, cfs 
Q o = Q a / (A C), where A = Tributary area in acres, C = weighted runoff coefficient 
Detention time in minutes, T = -25 + sqrt(10,312.5 / Q o ) 
Storage volume per impervious acre, V s = 16,500 T / (T + 25) - 40 Q o T 
Required detention volume in cubic feet, V = V s x A x C 
(3) ?For development sites five acres and less, the detention basin volume shall be determined for 
the ten-year flood volume from all tributary area, including off-site area. 
a. ?The tributary area shall include all acreage contributing runoff to the detention storage 
facility, including any off-site tributary area in its existing state, whether developed or 
undeveloped. 
b. ?The following equations shall be used to determine the ten-year detention volume: 
Q a = Allowable release rate, cfs 
Q o = Q a / (A C), where A = Tributary area in acres, C = weighted runoff coefficient 
Detention time in minutes, T = -25 + sqrt(6,562.5 / Q o ) 
Storage volume per impervious acre, V s = 10,500 T / (T + 25) - 40 Q o T 
Required detention volume in cubic feet, V = V s x A x C 
(4) ?If the site is located near the downstream end of a drainage district, the city engineer may 
require that the proprietor's engineer generate and submit hydrographs of the outflow from the 
existing site and from the proposed site (i.e., detention facility) and a hydrograph of the flow in 
the receiving drain to verify that the detained outflow would not result in an increase in the peak 
flow in the receiving drain. If the detained outflow would result in an increase in the peak flow in 
the receiving drain, then stormwater detention is not an acceptable stormwater management 
option. Retention of stormwater or other stormwater management design approved by the city 
engineer must be provided. See section 46-222, retention basins, for design requirements. 
(5) ?Portions of the developing site may be allowed to drain unrestricted (i.e., not through a 
detention facility) if either of the following conditions are met: 
a. ?The areas draining unrestricted are not being disturbed or altered by the construction, such 
that they will maintain their existing drainage characteristics and patterns. 
b. ?The areas draining unrestricted are being disturbed or altered but will be permanently 
stabilized to prevent erosion and will not contain any impervious surface post-construction. 
In this case, the unrestricted flow must be draining to a receiving drain with valid rights-of-
way, or else written agreement from the affected property owners would have to be 
obtained per Common Law Natural Flow Rights and the Michigan Drain Code. In addition, 
the post-construction peak 100-year flow from these areas should be calculated and 
deducted from the total allowable peak flow from the detention facility (Qa). The detention 
outlet(s) should be designed to restrict the basin outflow(s) to this reduced allowable peak 
flow rate. 
(6) ?Where the detention facility is to be equipped with a pump discharge, the proprietor shall be 
required to furnish design data on pump(s) and discharge force main so that the capacity of the 
system can be verified. These data will include system curve calculations, the pump 
performance curves, and a profile of the system piping. The pumping station should be able to 
release the first flush volume over approximately 24 hours, the bankfull flood volume over 24-48 
hours, and the 100-year flood volume at a rate not to exceed 0.15 cfs/ac of tributary area. A 
back-up generator will be required to ensure the operation of the pumping station in the event of 
power loss. The city discourages the use of pumped outlets, and will not accept responsibility 
for damages due to power failure, pump malfunction, or Acts of God that result in storm 
conditions that exceed the design conditions of the pump station. 
(7) ?An agreement for acceptance and maintenance of the detention facility, if executed by the 
proprietor, shall be submitted to the City of Eastpointe prior to final approval. The agreement 
both as form and content shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-221.1. - Detention basins. 
    A detention basin is a form of detention storage where the stormwater is detained above ground as 
surface water. In addition to the general requirements indicated above, detention basins shall meet the 
following requirements: 
(1) ?Detention volume in a gravity-outlet detention basin must be located: 
a. ?Above the invert of the lowest row of orifices in the outlet standpipe; 
b. ?Above the elevation of the dry weather base flow in the receiving drain; 
c. ?Above the elevation of the groundwater table. Soil boring data used to determine the 
groundwater table elevation shall be submitted with the plans. 
(2) ?The detention basin outlet shall consist of a vertical standpipe with multi-level orifices to control 
the release of stormwater from the basin, including the first flush volume, bankfull flood volume, 
and 100-year flood volume (or ten-year flood volume for sites less than five acres). 
a. ?The standpipe shall not be less than 36 inches in diameter. 
b. ?The standpipe shall contain multiple rows of orifices (i.e., holes) to control the release of 
the first flush runoff volume, the bankfull flood volume, and the 100-year flood volume (or 
ten-year for sites less than five acres). 
? First flush orifices shall be located at the elevation of the basin floor (or permanent pool 
water level, if a wet basin); 
? Additional bankfull flood orifices shall be at the elevation of the first flush volume in the 
basin, where the first flush volume is calculated as the first one inch of runoff over the site; 
or 
Vff (cf) = 3630 x A(acres) x C, where C is the runoff coefficient 
? Additional 100-year (or ten-year for sites less than five acres) flood control orifices shall 
be located at the elevation of the bankfull flood volume in the basin, where the bankfull 
flood volume is calculated as the rainfall from a 1.5-year storm; or 
Vbf (cf) = 8170 x A(acres) x C 
To promote improved filtering of runoff sediment from smaller, more frequent storm events, 
the bankfull flood and first flush volumes shall be based on the developing tributary site 
area only, and not include off-site tributary area. 
c. ?Orifices should not be less than one inch in diameter or greater than four inches in 
diameter. 
d. ?The top of the standpipe shall consist of a grating at or above the design (high) water level 
to serve as an overflow mechanism, in addition to the overflow spillway/berm. 
e. ?The standpipe shall be encased in stone extending to the design (high) water level to allow 
for filtering of the stormwater prior to discharge from the basin. The encasement stone size 
shall be large enough so as not to plug or pass through the orifices in the standpipe. 
f. ?The standpipe shall contain a sediment sump with a depth of at least one foot. 
g. ?Double standpipes (e.g., a 36-inch diameter inner standpipe within a 48-inch diameter 
outer standpipe) are encouraged. Double standpipes are believed to be less prone to 
blockages of the control orifices, and therefore require less maintenance. The inner 
standpipe should contain the appropriate number and configuration of orifices to provide 
the controlled release of the first flush volume, the bankfull flood volume, and the 100-year 
(or ten-year for sites less than five acres) flood volume. The outer standpipe should contain 
at least several times the orifice area as the inner standpipe over the entire height of the 
standpipe, such that the head loss across the outer standpipe orifices is negligible. 
h. ?The outlet pipe extending from the standpipe to the receiving drain shall be sized to convey 
the calculated 100-year (or ten-year for sites less than five acres) peak inflow to the 
detention basin. 
i. ?The location of the outlet pipe extending downstream of the standpipe shall be indicated on 
a profile drawing of the receiving drain, whether or not the receiving drain is an established 
drain. The receiving drain profile shall extend at least from the upstream end of the site to 
the downstream end of the site. 
(3) ?A sediment sump shall be provided within the basin, below the lowest orifice elevation but 
above the groundwater table, to provide for sediment accumulation. 
a. ?The volume of the sump shall be equivalent to the first flush volume, or one inch of runoff 
over the site area. (Sump volume, cf = V ff = 3630 x A x C) 
b. ?Appropriate precautions shall be taken to protect public safety and to ensure that the sump 
does not constitute a nuisance. 
(4) ?All detention basins must have standpipe overflow grates and spillways berms for emergency 
overflow at the high water level. 
a. ?The standpipe overflow grate and spillway must provide adequate capacity to overflow the 
peak 100-year (or ten-year for sites less than five acres) basin inflow with no more than 
one foot of head (i.e., water level must not exceed the one foot of freeboard). 
b. ?Downstream of the overflow spillway, the stormwater overflow must be directed (either by 
overland flow or via a swale or ditch) to the receiving drain. 
(5) ?A minimum of one-foot freeboard shall be provided above the design high water elevation. 
(6) ?The side slopes shall not be steeper than fix feet horizontal to one foot vertical. Slope 
protection shall be provided as necessary. Basin side slope elevation contours shall be shown 
on the plans. 
(7) ?Unless the detention basin contains a permanent pool, the bottom of all detention basins shall 
be graded in such a manner as to provide positive flow to the outlet. A minimum bottom slope of 
one percent shall be provided. 
(8) ?A 12-foot wide minimum access easement shall be provided for all detention basins, as 
measured from the top of bank. 
(9) ?A 25-foot wide minimum setback from property lines shall be provided for all detention basins, 
as measured from the top of bank. 
(10) ?Detention basin configurations where stormwater must "back-up" into the basin (i.e., 
stormwater enters the conveyance system downstream of the basin) will not be permitted. 
(11) ?Multiple detention basins serving a single development should function independently. If the 
outflow from one basin passes through another basin before being discharged to the receiving 
drain, a full hydraulic analysis (i.e., a computer model simulation) will be required to ensure that 
the system functions satisfactorily. 
(12) ?If at any time the detention basin is to function as a sediment basin (for use during the 
construction phase), an outlet filter shall be provided. Such an outlet filter is to be designed in 
accordance with criteria established by the Macomb County Public Works Office. Such use of a 
detention pond shall be considered a temporary measure only. The proprietor shall be 
responsible for sediment removal upon completion of construction. 
(13) ?Detention basins shall meet all local ordinances and/or requirements for "ponds." 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-221.2. - Underground storage. 
    Underground storage is a form of detention storage where the stormwater is detained in 
underground pipes. Like a detention basin, the water is released at a controlled rate to a receiving drain. 
    In addition to the general requirements indicated above in section 46-221.1, underground detention 
facilities shall meet the following requirements: 
(1) ?Detention volume in an underground detention facility shall be located above the elevation of 
the dry weather baseflow in the receiving drain and above the elevation of the groundwater 
table. Soil boring data used to determine the groundwater table shall be submitted with the 
plans. 
(2) ?To minimize sedimentation in the downstream drainage district, sediment shall be removed 
from the stormwater before water enters the underground storage facility (e.g., in first flush 
forebay or within the catch basins using removable filtration inserts). 
(3) ?The pipe material used for the underground storage facility shall have an expected life of at 
least 50 years. 
(4) ?Access manholes shall be provided along the underground storage facility to allow for 
maintenance. 
(5) ?A minimum of one foot of freeboard shall be provided between the design hydraulic grade line 
in the underground storage facility and the rim elevations of all access manholes. 
(6) ?A 25-foot wide setback from property lines shall be provided for all underground storage 
facilities. 
(7) ?An access easement shall be provided to and above the underground storage facility. 
(8) ?No permanent structures shall be constructed above the underground storage facility. 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-222. - Retention basins. 
    A "retention basin" is a facility with no engineered outlet (other than an emergency-type outlet) 
designed to hold runoff for a considerable length of time. The water in a retention basin is not discharged 
to a drain, although it may be consumed by plants, evaporate, or infiltrate into the ground. A retention 
basin should not be confused with a "detention basin," a facility designed to detain runoff for a short 
period of time and then release it to a drain. 
(1) ?On-site retention (or detentionSee section 46-221.2, detention storage facilities) is required 
of all new developments or redevelopments to prevent an increase in peak flows downstream in 
the drainage district. 
a. ?Retention basins are an acceptable stormwater management practice on sites where the 
soil has an infiltration rate of at least 0.52 inches per hour and a clay content of less than 
30 percent (per recommendations in Guidebook of Best Management Practices for 
Michigan Watersheds). The required storage volume of a retention basin is that of the 
runoff from a 100-year design storm as determined using the SCS method. 
b. ?Retention basins shall accommodate runoff from off-site areas that drain onto/across the 
developing site. (An exception to this rule would be if off-site runoff were to be routed 
around the site to a receiving drain, if done in a manner such that runoff from the 
developing site would not contribute to this off-site flow. If the off-site flow were to be 
concentrated from overland flow to a point discharge into an receiving drain without valid 
rights-of-way, written agreement from the affected property owners would have to be 
obtained per Common Law Natural Flow Rights and the Michigan Drain Code.) 
(2) ?One foot of freeboard shall be provided above the design high water elevation. 
(3) ?Retention volume must be provided above the elevation of the groundwater table. Soil boring 
data used to determine the groundwater table elevation shall be submitted with the plans. 
(4) ?All retention basins must have a spillway for emergency overflow at the high water level. 
a. ?The spillway must provide adequate capacity to overflow the peak 100-year basin inflow 
with no more than two feet of head (i.e., water level must not exceed the two feet of 
freeboard). 
b. ?The plans must identify where the overflow would be directed to flow or stored in the event 
of an overflow. 
(5) ?The side slopes shall not be steeper than six feet horizontal to one foot vertical unless fenced 
in accordance with city requirements. Slope protection shall be provided as necessary. Basin 
side slope elevation contours shall be shown on the plans. 
(6) ?A 12-foot wide access easement shall be provided to and around all retention basins. 
(7) ?An agreement for acceptance and maintenance of the retention basin system, if executed by 
the proprietor, shall be submitted to the City of Eastpointe prior to final approval. The agreement 
both as form and content shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(8) ?If at any time during the construction period the retention basin is to function as a sediment 
basin, the proprietor shall be responsible for sediment removal prior to completion of 
construction. (See Macomb County Department of Public Health for requirements regarding Soil 
Erosion and Sedimentation Control during construction.) 
(Ord. No. 1113, 11-10-2014) 


Sec. 46-223. - Oil separators. 
    Oil must be removed from stormwater as appropriate prior to discharge to a receiving drain. The city 
engineer will consider means of oil removal on a case-by-case basis.

fees are paid in accordance with the schedule of fees adopted by the city council. 
(b) ?The site plan shall not be placed on the planning commission agenda until such time the building 
official determines the site plan is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and is ready 
for planning commission review and action. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-43. - Review. 
(a) ?In the process of reviewing the site plan, the following items shall be considered: 
(1) ?Whether or not the proposed site plan is in accordance with all provisions and requirements of 
this chapter. 
(2) ?The location and design of driveways providing vehicular ingress to and egress from the site, in 
relation to streets giving access to the site, and in relation to pedestrian traffic. Where one or 
more nonresidential driveways have been established prior to any redevelopment, one or more 
existing driveways may be permitted to remain subject to final site plan approval. The planning 
commission may reduce the number of driveways in existence to utilize access management 
practices. An approved permit, in compliance with the approved site plan, authorizing any curb 
cuts from the public agency having jurisdiction over any abutting public thoroughfare shall be 
furnished prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(3) ?The traffic circulation patterns within the site and the location and placement of buildings, 
parking areas and loading areas as they relate to: 
a. ?Safety and convenience of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic on and adjacent to the site; 
b. ?Satisfactory and harmonious relationships between the development on the site and the 
existing and prospective development of contiguous land and in adjacent neighborhoods; 
and 
c. ?Necessary accessibility by emergency vehicles, etc. 
(4) ?The minimizing of adverse effects on desirable environmental and physical characteristics of 
the site, as balanced against the reasonable development of the site. 
(5) ?Whether or not landscaping, fences, walls and berms are in conformity with necessary 
screening requirements. 
(6) ?Whether or not the proposed site plan is in accord with the spirit and purpose of this chapter 
and not inconsistent with, or contrary to, the objectives sought to be accomplished by this 
chapter and the principles of sound planning. 
(7) ?For the purpose of promoting and protecting the public health, safety, convenience and general 
welfare of the inhabitants and the land resources of the city, provision is made herein for the 
submission and review of a site plan. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-44. - Action after review. 
    Upon reviewing a site plan, one of the following actions shall be taken: 
(1) ?If the site plan meets all the requirements of this chapter and related development 
requirements and standards, the planning commission and/or city council shall approve such 
plan and shall record such approval on the site plan, filing one copy in the official site plan file 
and returning one copy to the applicant. 
(2) ?If the site plan does not meet the requirements of this chapter and related development 
requirements and standards, the planning commission and/or city council shall deny such plan 
and shall record the reasons for such denial. The applicant may subsequently refile a corrected 
site plan under the same procedures followed for the initial submission. 
(3) ?If minor corrections to the site plan are necessary, then such conditions shall be noted and 
conditional approval may be granted. One copy shall be retained in the official site plan file and 
one copy shall be returned to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-45. - Modifying an approved site plan. 
    Any requests to modify or alter an approved site plan shall be submitted to the building department 
for processing. Minor modifications or alterations to a previously approved site plan may be approved by 
the building department provided the change does not: 
(1) ?Alter the basic design or layout of the approved site plan; or 
(2) ?Change or negate any condition that the planning commission may have placed on the site 
plan at the time of approval. 
a. ?When considering whether an approved site plan may be reviewed and approved by the 
building department when modifications or alterations to the approved plan are proposed, 
the building department may consider the following conditions a minor modification or 
alteration to a previously approved site plan, when: 
1. ?A change in the size (footprint) of a building does not result in: 
i. ?The need for additional off-street parking spaces; 
ii. ?A diminishing of any building setback to a point less than the minimum applicable 
setback requirement of the district; 
iii. ?A reduction in the area of the site devoted to landscaping to less than the 
minimum applicable requirements of this chapter; 
2. ?A change in the exterior appearance of the building that does not involve more than 
five percent of the entire exterior building wall surface of the building and which will 
not introduce exterior building wall materials that are not permitted by ordinance, nor 
change the basic color of the exterior walls of the building; 
3. ?A change in the basic location of the principal building when the change does not 
adversely impact any other element of the site, including, but not necessarily limited 
to, the location, layout and number of off-street parking spaces, general site traffic and 
pedestrian circulation or the extent of site landscaping; 
4. ?Modifications to general site access including the redesign or inclusion of acceleration 
and/or deceleration lanes as directed by the political jurisdiction in control of the right-
of-way, boulevard entrances, or the inclusion of pedestrian access ways, including 
bicycle paths; 
5. ?Modifications to the interior floor plan, provided the change does not result in the need 
for more off-street parking spaces, or a change in the location of any approved 
loading or unloading area, or drive-up service area; 
6. ?There is a change in the location, design and size of an exterior sign that had been 
approved by the planning commission, provided the sign complies with the 
requirement of this chapter, pertaining to signs, as amended, but which does not 
increase the size or appearance of the approved sign; 
7. ?There is any internal change to the location, layout, or number of off-street parking 
spaces required on the approved site plan; and 
8. ?Modifications are requested by the city's public safety departments that will not 
adversely impact the minimum applicable requirements of this chapter. 
b. ?When the building department determines that a proposed modification or alteration to an 
approved site plan constitutes greater changes than those above outlined in this section, 
the building department shall notify the applicant of its decision and forward the site plan to 
the planning commission for review and consideration. 
c. ?The building official shall also: 
1. ?Have the authority to consult with any other city department head, consultant or other 
appropriate agency regarding site plan issues. 
2. ?Provide a report to the planning commission each month regarding the issues which 
the building department heard. 
d. ?Any and all costs associated with the administrative review conducted by the building 
department shall be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-46. - Effective period. 
    The approval of a site plan shall be effective for a period of 12 months from the date of such 
approval unless otherwise specified in this chapter. If a building permit has not been obtained and 
construction commenced, the approval shall be null and void. Approval of a phase of an overall site plan 
does not constitute approval of the entire site plan. A one-year extension to the site plan approval may be 
granted by the planning commission/city council for good cause. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-47. - Notice of hearing. 
    Whenever a site plan requires planning commission review and approval prior to the issuance of a 
building permit, the planning commission shall provide notice to the residents within 300 feet of the site of 
the proposed project and shall take comments on the application up to and at the time the application is 
considered by the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-48. - Intent. 
    Typically, various land use activities are provided for in one or more zoning districts. The criteria for 
such allocations are based upon similarities in the nature of the uses and their relationship to other uses 
and thoroughfares. Essentially, the zoning districts are established to coordinate with and provide for 
effectuation of the city's master land use plan in a logical and desirable manner. There are, however, 
various existing and specialized uses whose operational characteristics and influences require special 
consideration if they are to be effectively and reasonably permitted in the city. It is, therefore, the intent of 
this section to set forth the basic and specialized review process and requirements necessary to evaluate 
and control these uses within the city and further determine any other reasonable requirements which will 
provide for their development and operation without adversely affecting the public health, safety and 
welfare of the city as a whole. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-49. - Special land use permits; action by planning commission. 
(a) ?Procedure for applying shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Applications for special use permits shall be filed with the building department on a form 
provided by the city. 
(2) ?Each application shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount as adopted by the city council. 
(3) ?The application shall also include such information as required by Article V Site Plans and 
Special Land Uses. 
(4) ?The completed application shall be signed by the fee holder of the affected property. 
(b) ?As a part of completing a review and study of an application for a special land use approval, the 
planning commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with section 50-37. 
(c) ?Following the public hearing and deliberation of the standards below, the planning commission shall 
forward a copy of the application, the minutes of the public hearing and the commission's 
recommendation to the city council. 
(d) ?The city council shall review and make the final determination on the application. Prior to approving 
any application for a special land use approval, the city council shall find adequate evidence that the 
proposed use: 
(1) ?Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives of the master land use 
plan; 
(2) ?Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in harmony with the existing and 
intended character of the general area and so that the use will not change the essential 
character of that area; 
(3) ?Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring uses; 
(4) ?Will represent an improvement to property in the immediate vicinity and to the community as a 
whole; 
(5) ?Will be served adequately by essential public services and facilities, such as highways, streets, 
drainage structures, sewer and water infrastructure, police and fire protection and refuse 
disposal, or that persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use 
shall be able to provide adequately for such services; 
(6) ?Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and services, 
and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community; 
(7) ?Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and conditions of operation 
that will be detrimental to any person or property or to the general welfare by reason of 
excessive smoke, fumes, glare, noise, vibration or odors; and 
(8) ?Will be consistent with the intent and purposes of this chapter. 
(e) ?In order to ensure that the proposed special land use approval fulfills the requirements of this article, 
the following shall apply: 
(1) ?The planning commission may recommend and the city council may require such additional 
conditions and safeguards as deemed necessary for the protection of the health, safety, and 
general welfare and individual property rights as well as ensuring that the intent and objectives 
of this chapter are observed. The breach of any condition, safeguard or requirement and the 
failure to correct such breach within 30 days after an order to correct is issued by the city shall 
be reason for immediate revocation of the permit. Additional time for correction of the cited 
violation may be allowed by the city upon submission of proof of good and sufficient cause. 
Conditions and requirements stated as a part of special land use approval authorizations shall 
be continuing obligations of the holders of such permits and are binding upon their heirs and 
assigns and upon any persons taking title to the affected property while such special use permit 
is in effect. Accordingly, the special land use approval and any conditions shall be recorded with 
the Macomb County Register of Deeds. 
(2) ?The discontinuance of a special land use approval for 12 months or more after a specified time 
may be grounds for the termination of the permit. Renewal of a special use permit may be 
granted after a new application, review and determination by the city council, after 
recommendation of the planning commission. The special land use approval may also require 
that a specified percentage of authorized construction be completed within a stated time as a 
condition of the issuance of the permit. 
(3) ?No application for a special use permit which has been denied by the city council shall be 
resubmitted until the expiration of one year from the date of such denial, except on grounds of 
newly discovered evidence or proof of changed conditions sufficient to justify reconsideration by 
the planning commission. Each reapplication will be treated as a new application. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


ARTICLE VI. - ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS 


Sec. 50-50. - Establishment and membership. 
(a) ?The zoning board of appeals shall perform its duties and exercise its powers as provided in Public 
Act No. 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3101 et seq.) as amended, and in such a way that the objectives of 
this chapter shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done. The board shall 
consist of seven members all appointed by the mayor with the consent of the city council. 
Appointments shall be for a period of three years. 
(b) ?One regular member may be a member of the city council, but shall not serve as chair of the zoning 
board of appeals. An employee or contractor of the city may not serve as a member of the zoning 
board of appeals.

to the zoning board of appeals. An alternate member may be called as specified to serve as a 
member of the zoning board of appeals in the absence of a regular member, if the regular member 
will be unable to attend one or more meetings. An alternate member may also be called to serve as 
a member for the purpose of reaching a decision on a case in which a regular member has 
abstained for reasons of conflict of interest. The alternate member appointed shall serve on the case 
until a final decision is made. The alternate member shall have the same voting rights as a regular 
member of the zoning board of appeals. 
(d) ?No member or alternate member of the zoning board of appeals shall serve as a member of the 
planning commission. Also, no member of the planning commission shall serve as a member or

absence or state the reason for the member's failure to vote. After each meeting, the zoning board of 
appeals shall file a copy of the minutes in the office of the Eastpointe City Clerk, and that record shall 
become a public record. The concurrent vote of a majority of the total members of the board shall be 
necessary to render a decision. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-52. - Appeals. 
(a) ?An appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by a person aggrieved or by an officer,

board may appeal that decision to the county circuit court as provided in Sections 605 and 606 of the 
Zoning Enabling Act (PA 110 of 2006), as amended. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-53. - Stay of proceedings. 
    An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action unless the building department 
certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of appeal is filed that a stay would, in the opinion of 
the department, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such a case, the proceedings shall not be 
stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the circuit court. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-54. - Fees for appeals.

of the city to defray the expenses of administering this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-55. - Powers. 
(a) ?Generally. The zoning board of appeals shall not alter or change the zoning district classification of 
any property, nor grant a use variance that would allow a use to be established in a zoning district in 
which the use would not otherwise be permitted. However, the board may act on those matters 
where this chapter provides for an administrative review, interpretation, exception or special approval 
permit and may authorize a variance as defined in this section, and/or state law. 
(b) ?Administrative review. The board may hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant 
that there is an error in any order, requirement, permit, decisions or refusal made by the building 
department, planning commission or any other administrative official or body in carrying out or 
enforcing this chapter, except as otherwise prohibited in this section. 
(c) ?Variances. Where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter would involve 
practical difficulties with implementation of this chapter, the board may, upon appeal, authorize a 
variation or modification of this chapter and may impose conditions and safeguards it determines are 
necessary, so that the public health, safety and general welfare may be secured and substantial 
justice done. No such variance or modification of this chapter shall be granted unless it appears by 
competent, material and substantial evidence that all of the following facts and conditions exist: 
(1) ?There are unique circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the 
intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties or class of uses in 
the same district or zone. 
(2) ?Such variance or modification is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial 
property right possessed by other property in the same district or zone in which the property is 
located. 
(3) ?The granting of such variance or modification will not be materially detrimental to the public 
health, safety and general welfare or be materially injurious to the other property or 
improvements in such zone or district in which the property is located. 
(4) ?The granting of such a variance will not adversely affect the purposes or objectives of this 
chapter or the city's master plan. 
(d) ?Determinations. In consideration of all appeals and proposed variations from this chapter, the board 
shall first determine that the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to 
adjacent property, unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, increase the danger of 
fire, endanger the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within 
the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals or 
general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. 
(e) ?Limitations on authority. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the board 
the power or authority to alter or change this chapter or the zoning map, such power and authority 
being reserved to the city council in the manner provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013)

Sec. 50-57. - Effective period of orders. 
    No order of the zoning board of appeals permitting the erection or alteration of a building shall be

(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-61. - Uses not otherwise specified. 
    Other uses which have not been specifically mentioned in any district may be processed as a 
permitted use or as a special use as determined by the building official and if they possess unique or 
innovative operational or development characteristics. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-62. - Zoning district requirementsGenerally. 
    All buildings and uses permitted in any zoning district shall be subject to the applicable standards of 
this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-63. - Zoning district boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the official zoning map of 
the city. The official zoning map and copies of the map are on file at the office of the city clerk as well as

Sec. 50-64. - Zoning district boundaries interpreted. 
    Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the 
zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1) ?Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets, highways or alleys, 
shall be construed to follow such centerline. 
(2) ?Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as 
following such lot lines. 
(3) ?Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limit lines shall be construed as following 
city limit lines. 
(4) ?Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of features indicated in subsections (1) 
through (3) of this section, shall be so construed. 
(5) ?Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale 
of the map. 
(6) ?Where physical or natural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on 
the official zoning map, in other circumstances not covered by subsections (1) through (4) of 
this section, or where a property owner or applicant disagrees with the interpretation of the 
zoning map, the zoning board of appeals shall interpret the district boundaries. 
(7) ?Insofar as some or all of the various districts may be indicated on the official zoning map by 
lines which, for the sake of map clarity, may not fully divide public rights-of-way, it is intended 
that such district boundaries do extend to the center of any public right-of-way. 
(8) ?In the event that the zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret 
because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city council may, by resolution, 
adopt a new zoning map. The new zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions 
in the prior zoning map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original 
zoning map or any subsequent amendment.

Sec. 50-65. - Zoning of vacated areas. 
    Whenever any park, commons, outlet, or any street, alley or other public way, or portion thereof in

thereof, shall automatically be classified in the same zoning district as the property to which it attaches, 
unless otherwise recommended by the planning commission.

Sec. 50-71. - R-2 Two-Family Residential District. 
(a) ?Intent. The R-2 Two-Family Residential District is designed to afford a transition of use in existing 
housing areas by permitting new construction or conversion of existing structures between adjacent 
residential, commercial, office, thoroughfare or other uses which would affect the residential 
character. This district also recognizes the existence of older residential areas of the city where 
larger houses have been or can be converted from one-family to two-family residences in order to 
extend the economic life of these structures and allow the owners to justify the expenditures for 
repairs and modernization. This district also allows the construction of new two-family residences 
where slightly greater densities are reasonable. 
(b) ?Regulations (also see Schedule of Regulations).

Sec. 50-80. - RT Townhome Residential District. 
(a) ?Intent. The RT Townhome Residential District is designed to provide sites for lower density 
townhome dwellings and related uses which will serve as zones of transition between major 
thoroughfares and/or nonresidential uses and lower density districts, typically on parcels which may 
be otherwise difficult to develop. This district is intended to preserve the basic single-family character 
and density of an area without introducing higher density multiple-family uses. The RT Townhome 
Residential District may also permit the preservation of natural features of the site when such 
development would not conflict with the existing and potential land use patterns in the area. 
(b) ?Regulations (also see Schedule of Regulations).

b. ?Building placement. 
1. ?Mixed use core. 
i. ?Front build to line: Zero feet from front property line. 
The front facade of the building must be built on the front property line for a 
minimum of 60 percent of the lot width. Depending on the architecture of the 
building, the proposed uses, and nature of the lot, the planning commission may 
approve deviations from this requirement. Balconies for residential units may not 
extend into a public right-of-way. 
ii. ?Side yard setback: Zero feet from side property line. 
If windows or door openings exist, a minimum side yard setback of ten feet shall 
be provided. 
iii. ?Rear yard setback: 20 feet from rear property line. 
2. ?Live/Work Nine Mile. 
i. ?Front build to line: 15 feet from front property line. 
Depending on the architecture of the building, the proposed uses, and nature of 
the lot, the planning commission may approve deviations from this requirement. 
Balconies may not extend into a public right-of-way. 
ii. ?Side yard setback: Zero feet from side property line. 
If windows or door openings exist, a minimum side yard setback of ten feet shall 
be provided. 
iii. ?Rear yard setback: 20 feet from rear property line. 
c. ?Permissible building encroachments. 
Awnings may extend into a public right-of-way, over a sidewalk, over dedicated parking 
areas, but shall not extend over a property line in separate ownership. 
For awnings which extend over a pedestrian area, a minimum clearance of eight feet shall 
be provided. If the area is for automobiles or maneuvering of automobiles a minimum 
clearance of 14 feet must be provided. 
d. ?Use of public right-of-way or other outdoor private space. 
1. ?The following uses may be permitted into a public right-of-way or on a public sidewalk: 
i. ?Outdoor cafe area, including tables; 
ii. ?Outdoor sales space; 
iii. ?Outdoor signage (permitted by the city); 
iv. ?Street vendors; 
v. ?Other outdoor uses as deemed appropriate by the city. 
2. ?A permit shall be obtained from the city building department (or other appropriate 
department as necessary) prior to the use of any public right-of-way or public 
sidewalk. The following shall be conditions of the permit: 
i. ?A minimum of one-half of the width of the sidewalk shall be maintained clear and 
unobstructed. 
ii. ?Any use that requires the installation of a fence or other permanent structure shall 
provide assurance that should the outdoor use cease, that the fence or structure 
shall be removed. 
e. ?Building height. 
1. ?The minimum building height shall be two stories and 24 feet in height. 
2. ?The maximum building height shall be six stories and 72 feet in height (if a building 
height bonus is approved as outlined in this section). 
3. ?Existing buildings which are less than two stories in height may receive a waiver to the 
minimum height requirements of this chapter. In considering whether to grant a 
deferment, the planning commission shall consider the following factors amongst any 
other factors it determines to be pertinent: 
i. ?The change in use is determined by the planning commission to be minor in 
nature and therefore does not justify the additional story(s) to be constructed. 
ii. ?The applicant can provide documented analysis from a certified architect or 
structural engineer that the cost of the improvements to the building to achieve 
the minimum height requirement is not justifiable. 
iii. ?An alternative design for the building facade is presented that generally meets 
the intent of the chapter. 
f. ?Building height bonus. 
1. ?A building height bonus of two stories or 24 feet (constituting a fifth and sixth story) 
may be permitted. 
i. ?If a building height bonus is sought, the application shall be reviewed as a special 
land use approval to ensure that the design and impacts of building will not 
negatively impact the surrounding properties or public spaces. 
ii. ?The commission may require that the additional stories be set back from the outer 
wall of the first four stories of the building to ensure that adequate light and views 
are maintained. This provision may be applied to any facade of the building to 
ensure proper building scale and massing relative to surrounding buildings and 
uses. 
g. ?Building appearance. 
1. ?Building material. 
i. ?Buildings located within the downtown shall be constructed with decorative face 
brick on all sides of the building which will be visible from a public space, 
including road rights-of-way, sidewalks, parks, etc. 
ii. ?The rear of the building which abuts an alley, parking or future parking area shall 
also be constructed of decorative face brick, similar to that of the front facade. 
iii. ?The planning commission may approve alternative materials such as stone, 
glass, metal, etc., when it can be shown that the alternative material provides 
architectural interest and is found to be consistent in architectural design of those 
buildings on the same block (either side of street). 
2. ?Entranceway. 
i. ?A building entry shall be oriented on the front facade of the building. Additional 
building entries are encouraged to be provided on the side or rear of the building 
as well to encourage additional pedestrian access. 
ii. ?The front entranceway shall generally be recessed from the remainder of the front 
facade. 
iii. ?Garage doors or other similar service doors shall not be permitted on the front 
facade of the building. 
3. ?Windows/transparency.

Sec. 50-93. - B-3 General Business District. 
(a) ?Intent . The B-3 General Business District is designed to provide sites for more diversified business 
uses which would often be incompatible with the types of more limited uses permitted in the other 
commercial districts. Many of the business uses permitted in the district are thoroughfare oriented 
and as such, generate greater volumes of traffic and activities which must be specifically considered 
to minimize adverse effects on adjacent properties.

(10) ?Adult entertainment. 
a. ?Location regulations. 
1. ?No adult entertainment use shall be located within 1,000 feet of any other adult 
entertainment use or within 600 feet of any of the following uses: 
i. ?All class C establishments licensed by the state liquor control commission. 
ii. ?Pool or billiard halls. 
iii. ?Coin-operated amusement centers. 
iv. ?Teenage discos or dancehalls. 
v. ?Ice or roller skating rinks. 
vi. ?Pawnshops. 
vii. ?Indoor or drive-in movie theaters. 
viii. ?Any public park. 
ix. ?Any church. 
x. ?Any public or private school having a curriculum including kindergarten or any 
one or more of the grades one through 12. 
xi. ?Any public building. 
xii. ?Any other regulated use as defined herein. 
2. ?Such distance shall be measured along the center line of the street or address 
between two fixed points on the center lines determined by projecting straight lines at 
right angles from the part of the uses set forth in this subsection nearest to the 
contemplated location of the structure containing the adult entertainment use and from 
the contemplated location of the structure containing the adult entertainment use. 
3. ?No adult entertainment use shall be located within 600 feet of any area zoned 
residential. Such required distance shall be measured by a straight line between the 
nearest point of the boundary line of a residential zoning district to the nearest building 
wall or contemplated building wall of the building intended to house an adult 
entertainment use. 
4. ?Any adult entertainment use shall be contained in a freestanding building. Enclosed 
malls, commercial strip stores or, common wall structures and multiple uses within the 
same structure, do not constitute freestanding buildings. 
5. ?No adult entertainment use shall be conducted in any manner that permits the 
observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual 
activities or specified anatomical areas from any public way or from any property not 
regulated as an adult entertainment use. This subsection shall apply to any display, 
decoration, sign, show window or other opening. 
b. ?Intent. It has been demonstrated that the establishment of adult entertainment businesses 
in business districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential 
neighborhoods has deleterious effects on both business and residential segments of the 
neighborhood, causing blight and a downgrading of property values. A prohibition against 
the establishment of more than two regulated uses within 1,000 feet of each other serves 
to avoid the clustering of certain businesses, which, when located in close proximity to 
each other, tend to create a marginal atmosphere. However, such prohibition fails to avoid 
the deleterious effects of blight and devaluation of both business and residential property 
values resulting from the establishment of adult bookstores, adult motion picture theaters, 
adult mini-motion picture theaters, adult motion picture arcades, adult motels, adult 
massage parlors, adult model studios, adult sexual encounter centers and adult cabarets in 
a business district which is immediately adjacent to, and which also serves adjoining 
residential neighborhoods. Concern for the pride in the orderly planning, development and 
preservation of the integrity of a residential neighborhood should be encouraged and 
fostered by those businesses and those persons who might otherwise comprise the 
business and residential integrity of the neighborhood. The planning commission and the 
city council should therefore be guided by the expressed will of those businesses and 
residences which are immediately adjacent to the proposed location of, and therefore, 
most affected by, the existence of any adult bookstore, adult motion picture, adult mini-
motion picture theater, adult cabaret, etc. 
c. ?The council may waive the limiting regulations of this section if all of the following are 
found: 
1. ?The proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to the nearby 
properties, and the spirit and intent of this chapter will be observed. 
2. ?The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of an undesirable 
area. 
3. ?The person seeking to establish the adult entertainment use shall include a petition 
which affirmatively demonstrates the approval of the proposed adult entertainment 
use by at least 50 percent of the persons owning or occupying premises within a 
radius of 600 feet of the proposed use. The petitioner shall attempt to contact all 
occupied premises within this radius, and must maintain a list of all addresses at 
which no contact was made. The person who circulates the petition requesting 
approval shall subscribe to a sworn affidavit attesting to the fact that the petition was 
circulated, that the person who circulated the petition personally witnessed the 
signatures on the petition and that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the same were 
affixed to the petition by the person whose name appeared thereon. The city council 
shall not consider the application until such petition has been filed and verified to the 
satisfaction of the city council. 
(11) ?Arcades. 
a. ?Any such use shall not be located closer than 100 feet to any residential district.

ARTICLE XI. - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 


Sec. 50-100. - I-1 Light Industrial District. 
(a) ?Intent. The I-1 Light Industrial District is designed to primarily accommodate wholesale activities, 
warehouses and industrial operations whose external, physical effects are restricted to the area of 
the district and in no manner affect in a detrimental way any of the surrounding districts. The I-1 
District is structured to permit, along with any specific use, the manufacturing, compounding, 
processing, packaging, assembly or treatment of finished or semi finished products from previously 
prepared material. The processing of raw material for shipment in bulk form to be used in an 
industrial operation at another location shall not be permitted. The general goals of the I-1 District 
include, among others, the following specific uses: 
(1) ?To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the city's expected 
future economy for all types of light manufacturing and related uses. 
(2) ?To protect abutting residential districts by separating them from manufacturing activities, and 
by prohibiting the use of such industrial area for new residential development. 
(3) ?To promote manufacturing development which is free from danger of fire, explosion, toxic and 
noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odor 
and other objectionable influences. 
(4) ?To protect the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well considered plan. 
(5) ?To protect the character and established pattern of adjacent development, to conserve, in each 
area, the value of land and buildings and other structures, and to protect the city's tax base.

ARTICLE XIII. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OPTION 


Sec. 50-120. - PD planned development option. 
(a) ?Intent. It is the implied intent of the PD planned development option to encourage quality 
development by providing for a diversified mix of land use. It is further the intent of this mixed use 
option to encourage quality design innovation by minimizing specific height, bulk, density and area 
standards, giving the applicant freedom to configure buildings, parking and related site amenities in 
ways that would otherwise be discouraged or curtailed under the standards of conventional zoning 
districts. Freedom from extensive layout controls is intended to encourage utilization of a site in ways 
that will more fully satisfy the site review criteria set forth in the PD option, so long as it is clearly 
understood that the absence of such regulatory standards in no way implies, or is to be interpreted to 
mean, that such critical site layout standards are excused or may be ignored with respect to 
development in the PD option. To the contrary, proper building setbacks and the thoughtful location 
and tasteful application of site amenities shall be considered as crucial design elements of any 
development proposed under the guidelines of the PD option and will be subject to careful review 
and evaluation by the city. Site plans which minimize or show little regard for such amenities will be 
subject to rejection by the city. 
(b) ?Application process. The PD planned development option shall be processed as a special land use 
request. An application for development under this section shall be made in accordance with the 
following procedures. 
(1) ?Submittal of an application for development under this option shall first be made to the planning 
commission for its review and recommendation to the city council. The process shall follow the 
procedures for special land use review. 
(2) ?A recommendation from the planning commission to the city council to approve the planned 
development application may be made upon a finding that: 
a. ?Development will consist of a mix and density of land use types when that type of mix and 
density is found by the planning commission and the city council to be appropriate for the 
property on which it is proposed; and 
b. ?The specific types of land uses and densities proposed and the proposed layout of the site 
is acceptable to the city. 
(3) ?Once the preliminary site plan has been approved by the council, no development shall take 
place therein and no use shall be made of any part thereof, until final site plan approval has 
been given by council, and then only in accordance with the approved site plan or in 
accordance with an approved amendment to that plan. 
(c) ?Application content. 
(1) ?The contents of an application submittal shall include: 
a. ?A legal survey of the exact area being requested for development under this section; 
b. ?Proof of ownership of the land or an option to purchase land being requested for 
development, with notarized documentation from the landowner approving of the rezoning 
request; and 
c. ?A written report (including plans and graphics as necessary) containing an assessment of 
the impact that the development will have on the site, surrounding area and city in general. 
The report shall consist of at least the following: 
1. ?A statement as to the general vegetation characteristics of the site, in terms of type, 
coverage and quality and how those areas will be integrated into the site. 
2. ?A statement explaining in detail the full intent of the application, indicating the specifics 
of the type of development proposed for the site including details of the proposed 
residential number and types of units as well as the square footage of nonresidential 
use; 
3. ?A statement as to the effect the intended use of the property will have on adjacent 
properties in terms of line of sight, light, drainage, air, traffic, noise, hours of operation, 
etc.; 
4. ?The preliminary plan submitted shall show how the site conforms to any streets, roads 
or other public conveyances, as well as public utility layouts, including drainage 
course systems; 
5. ?Preliminary drawings indicating the general architecture of the proposed building or 
buildings including overall design and types of exterior wall materials to be used and 
how the proposed architectural design and facade materials will be complimentary to 
existing or proposed uses within the site and on surrounding lands; and 
6. ?A clear designation on each building depicted on the site plan of its specific use, i.e., 
residential, retail, commercial, service commercial, office, etc. 
(d) ?Review of preliminary planned development application. 
(1) ?The planning commission, upon receipt of an application to develop under the PD planned 
development section, shall first set a public hearing date for review of the application. 
(2) ?Once the public hearing has been conducted, the planning commission, in considering a 
request to approve a preliminary planned development application, may recommend approval of 
the request to city council only after it finds that: 
a. ?The request is being made with the full intent of developing the land in strict accordance 
with the requirements of the PD section and proper assurances are in place to guarantee 
such; 
b. ?The uses proposed for development as presented on the submitted site plans are 
compatible with existing and planned uses on adjacent lands; 
c. ?The area being requested for approval is either fully served by public utilities, including 
water and sanitary sewer, or will be fully served through the improvement of such public 
utilities to the site at the time of development; and 
d. ?The preliminary site plan is in compliance with the review criteria set forth in this section 
and other applicable requirements of this chapter. 
e. ?The application is consistent with the planning standards of section 50-49. 
(3) ?Further, the planning commission prior to approval shall find that the following conditions are 
met: 
a. ?The plan satisfies the intent of this section with respect to the use of land and principal and 
accessory use relationships within the site, as well as with uses on adjacent sites. 
b. ?All existing or proposed streets, roads, utilities and marginal access service drives, as may 
be required provide logical extensions of the existing systems. 
c. ?The plan meets all applicable standards of this section relating to building height, bulk, 
dwelling unit density, building setback guidelines, off-street parking and preliminary site 
engineering requirements. 
d. ?There exists a reasonably harmonious relationship between the placement of buildings on 
the site and buildings on adjoining lands, and there is functional compatibility between all 
structures on the site and structures within the surrounding area to ensure proper 
relationships between: 
1. ?One building to another, whether on-site or on adjacent land, i.e., entrances, service 
areas and mechanical appurtenances; and 
2. ?Street, road, parking areas and public utility layouts approved for the area. 
3. ?Upon review of the preliminary site plan by the planning commission, the planning 
commission shall forward its findings and recommendations, along with all plans and 
supporting documents, to the city council for its review. 
(4) ?The city council shall review the preliminary site plan with regard to the planning commission's 
recommendations and the review requirements and conditions of this section. The city council 
may approve the preliminary site plan, provided that the city council finds the application 
appropriate. 
(e) ?Review of final planned development application. 
(1) ?A final detailed site plan shall be prepared and submitted to the planning commission for its 
review and recommendation to city council. The final site plan shall: 
a. ?Meet all the applicable requirements: 
b. ?Include plans and drawings illustrating in detail all physical layouts as indicated on the 
approved preliminary site plan, as well as exterior building wall elevation drawings detailed 
parking plans, landscaping plans and other physical plan details such as exterior site 
lighting, signs, etc., being proposed. Supporting documentation in the form of building 
plans and schedules of construction may also be requested. 
c. ?The planning commission, in making its review of the design and architecture, shall, be 
satisfied that there exists a reasonably harmonious relationship between the location of 
buildings on the site and on abutting properties and that there is reasonable design and 
architectural compatibility between all structures on the site and structures within the 
surrounding area to ensure proper relationships between: 
1. ?Building views and site lines as well as private and semi-private spaces; 
2. ?Landscape planting, off-street parking areas and service drives on adjacent lands; and 
3. ?The architecture of the proposed buildings, including overall design and building wall 
materials used. Architectural design and exterior building wall material should be 
complimentary to existing or proposed buildings within the site and the surrounding 
area. Care shall be taken to ensure that contrasts will not be out of character with 
existing building design and exterior building wall materials or create an adverse effect 
on the economic stability and value of the surrounding buildings. 
(2) ?The final site plan, along with all supporting documentation, shall accompany the planning 
commission's recommendations for final review by the city council. The council, in reviewing the 
final site plan, shall find that: 
a. ?The final site plan is in conformity with the preliminary site plan and meets the conditions of 
this section; 
b. ?The dedication of public rights-of-way and/or planned public open spaces, where proposed 
on the site plan, or as may be otherwise required, shall be made or properly assured; 
c. ?In residential use areas, any prorated open space has been irrevocably dedicated and 
retained as open space for park, recreation and related uses, and all such lands meet the 
requirements of the city; and 
d. ?All master deed and other applicable legal documents (such as development agreements, 
easements, rights-of-way, etc.) have been reviewed and approved. 
(3) ?When the city council shall find that all such conditions are met, it may grant final site plan 
approval. The granting of final site plan approval shall constitute final approval of the planned 
development. Development under the PD option shall rely upon the plan submitted and all 
supporting documentation. The plan, therefore, is basic to the planned development approval. 
Approval by the council of the planned development application, the final approved site plan and 
all supporting documents shall be recorded with the subject property at the Macomb County 
Register of Deeds. 
(f) ?Amendments to an approved planned development application. 
(1) ?Revisions to an approved preliminary or final site plan shall require the resubmittal of plan 
revisions to the building department for an administrative review. The building department, in 
making its review, may require such revisions to be resubmitted to the planning commission and 
city council for review and approval when, in its opinion, such revisions constitute a major or 
significant change in the previously approved plans, or when it feels such changes may 
compromise the intent and review standards of the PD section. Significant changes include, by 
way of example only and not as a limitation, increased dwelling unit size or density, increased 
nonresidential use areas, loss of substantial amounts of parking or relocation of buildings. The 
planning commission and city council, in making a review of a revised site plan, shall find that all 
revisions forwarded to them for review and approval meet all applicable requirements and 
guidelines of this section, including its general intent. If approved, such amendments shall be 
recorded along with all original information at the Macomb County Register of Deeds. 
(g) ?Timeframe of approval of an approved planned development application. 
(1) ?Approval of a preliminary site plan shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of 
preliminary approval by council. Approval of a final site plan shall be effective for a period of two 
years from the date of final approval by council. If substantial development is not evidenced on 
the site within two years from the date of final approval by council, all site plan approvals may 
be terminated. For the purpose of this section, the term "substantial" shall mean that at least 25 
percent of the development shall be in place, or well under construction on the site, within two 
years from the date of final site plan approval by the city council. 
(h) ?Phasing of an approved planned development application. 
(1) ?If development is to be undertaken in phases, the first development phase shall include not 
less than 25 percent of the total development proposed for the site, and shall include all 
infrastructure, including streets, relating to the phase, as well as all indoor and outdoor 
recreation facilities and community buildings that relate to the entire development. Each 
development phase shall be clearly identified on the site plan with a phase development line 
and identified as to which phase it is, i.e., phase 1, etc. All such data pertaining to each phase 
shall be clearly enumerated on the site plan by phase including the land area, in square feet or 
acres, which is involved in each phase. 
(i) ?Permitted uses. The following specified uses shall be permitted in a planned development: 
(1) ?Single-family dwellings. 
(2) ?Multiple-family dwellings. 
(3) ?Planned commercial centers and retail uses. 
(4) ?Offices and office-related uses.

(7) ?Banquet halls and restaurants. 
(j) ?Height, bulk, density and area standards. 
(1) ?Standards that apply to all development permitted in the PD section are outlined in this section. 
Since it is the intent of the PD section to encourage quality development through flexibility in 
land uses, design, and use relationships, only the following specified development control 
standards, in addition to those specified in this section, shall specifically apply: 
a. ?The minimum distance between nonresidential buildings, between nonresidential buildings 
and multiple-family buildings and between multiple-family buildings shall be subject to the 
formula provided in footnote (9) of section 50-151(a). 
b. ?All buildings shall be located at least 25 feet from any public street right-of-way line and at 
least 30 feet from any single-family district. 
c. ?Any setback requirements may be modified by the planning commission or by the city 
council at the time of site plan review if it is found that the height and/or bulk of a building is 
such that a greater or lesser setback would be warranted in the interests of promoting the 
general health, safety, welfare and common good of the community, or in the interests of 
improving the visual aesthetics of the site. 
d. ?Multiple-family dwellings may be permitted, subject to the following applicable conditions: 
1. ?Except for housing intended solely for the elderly (senior citizen housing) and except 
for multiple-family dwellings occupying the upper floors of multi-story mixed-use

5. ?Multiple-family dwellings, when occupied solely as housing for the elderly (senior 
citizen housing), shall be subject to the standards of sections 50-81 and 50-151; and 
6. ?Except for multiple-dwelling units in the upper floors of multi-story buildings, for which 
there is not maximum dwelling unit density, for the purposes of determining overall 
dwelling unit density, the dwelling unit density limitations shall apply to an area within 
the residential development of the site that is to be devoted to that particular type of 
multiple-family development. These areas shall be clearly delineated on the site plan, 
and the area in square feet of each of these multiple dwelling areas, along with the 
proposed dwelling unit density of each, i.e., the number of rooms proposed, shall be 
noted in a legend on the site plan. 
e. ?No off-street parking shall be located closer than ten feet to any public street right-of-way 
line or any other peripheral site boundary. 
(k) ?Required conditions. The following conditions, where applicable, shall apply to all uses permitted

ARTICLE XIV. - GRATIOT AVENUE CORRIDOR OVERLAY ZONE 


Sec. 50-130. - Gratiot Avenue Corridor Overlay Zone. 
(a) ?The intent of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Overlay Zone is to: 
(1) ?Improve traffic operations; 
(2) ?Reduce potential for crashes; 
(3) ?Improve pedestrian and transit environments; and 
(4) ?Preserve the vehicular carrying capacity of Gratiot Avenue through regulations on the number, 
spacing, placement and design of access points. 
Published reports and recommendations by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) 
show a relationship between the number of access points and the number of crashes. 
Recognizing the existing built character and downtown land use characteristics in the City of 
Eastpointe, this chapter intends to apply the MDOT access management standards where 
practical, but to allow flexibility in their application, given the unique needs of this more 
urbanized area. Development along Gratiot Avenue contains an interconnected, grid street 
pattern and urban building form that is highly conducive to downtown activity. This chapter 
intends to complement efforts to make Gratiot Avenue and Downtown Eastpointe more 
walkable by improving the transit and non-motorized environments by limiting the amount of 
direct access to Gratiot Avenue and thus the number of potential vehicle to pedestrian crashes. 
The segment of Gratiot Avenue within Eastpointe is characterized by a median road design that 
naturally restricts turning movements to a single direction, which present unique traffic 
operations; therefore, this chapter places more emphasis on the design and spacing of 
driveways from signalized intersections and median crossovers. 
(b) ?This overlay zone shall apply to all land with frontage along Gratiot Avenue. The following 
applications must also comply with the standards of this section. 
(1) ?New or enlarged building or structure. Any new principal building or structure, or the 
enlargement of any principal building or structure by more than 25 percent. 
(2) ?Land division, subdivision or site condominium. Any land division or subdivision or site 
condominium development, including residential development. 
(3) ?Change in use or intensity of use. Any increase in intensity of use or any increase in vehicle 
trips generated. 
(c) ?The following regulations of this section shall be considered by the planning commission: 
(1) ?Compliance with the corridor plan. Access shall generally be provided as shown in the Gratiot 
Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan. 
(2) ?Number of access points. The number of resulting access points shall be the fewest necessary 
to provide reasonable access to the site. Each lot shall be permitted one access point, which 
may consist of any individual driveway, a shared access with an adjacent use, or access via a 
service drive. 
(3) ?Additional access points. Additional access points may be permitted by the planning 
commission upon a finding that all other standards are met and/or if a traffic impact study is 
submitted that justifies a need for additional access due to safety reasons or where a poor level 
of service will result from fewer access points. 
(4) ?Spacing and offset from intersections. Access points shall be either directly aligned or 
spaced/offset as far from intersections as practical, especially signalized intersections. A 
minimum spacing or offset of 150 feet is preferred. 
(5) ?Consideration of median crossovers. Access points along median sections of Gratiot Avenue 
shall be located in consideration of median crossovers. The city supports MDOT policies to limit 
the number of median crossovers to maintain traffic flow and reduce the potential for accidents. 
Access points shall directly align with or be offset a sufficient distance from median crossovers 
to allow for weaving across travel lanes and storage with the median. A minimum offset of 250 
feet is preferred. 
 
(d) ?Spacing of access points on same side of road. 
(1) ?Access points shall provide the following spacing from other access points along the same side 
of the public street (measured from centerline to centerline as shown on the figure), based on 
the posted speed limit along the abutting road segment according to the following table, or 
where full compliance cannot be achieved, access shall be spaced as far apart as practical.

(e) ?Consideration of adjacent sites . 
(1) ?Where the subject site adjoins land that may be developed or redeveloped in the future, the 
access shall be located to ensure the adjacent site(s) can also meet the access location 
standards in the future. 
(f) ?Shared driveways. 
(1) ?Where direct access consistent with the above regulations cannot be achieved, access should 
be provided via a shared driveway or service drive. Where implemented, shared access or 
service driveways should be accompanied by an executed access agreement, signed by all the 
effected property owners. 
(g) ?Access design. 
(1) ?Where practical given right-of-way constraints, access points shall be designed with radii, 
tapers and other geometrics as determined by MDOT that are required to minimize the impacts 
of inbound right turns on traffic flow. 
(h) ?Review procedure. 
(1) ?Applications shall be reviewed according to the procedures set forth in article V. 
(i) ?Submittal information. 
(1) ?Along with any other required information, developments subject to review shall submit: 
a. ?Detailed information showing existing access points on adjacent sites; proposed access 
points; changes to existing access; and any information requested by the city that is 
needed to review site access. 
b. ?The planning commission may require submittal of a traffic impact report, prepared by a 
qualified traffic engineer, to verify the need for additional access points or to justify a 
modification. 
c. ?Where it is determined by the certain site plan submittal requirements are not necessary to 
the review and understanding of the site, the planning commission may waive the site plan 
requirements and allow submittal of a scaled drawing that provides sufficient detail to 
review site access. 
(j) ?Modification of plan standards. 
(1) ?The planning commission may waive certain requirements of this section upon consideration of 
the following: 
a. ?The proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this 
overlay zone and the recommendations of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan 
and published MDOT guidelines. 
b. ?MDOT staff endorses the proposed access design. 
c. ?Driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on 
through traffic flow. 
d. ?The modification is for an access point that has, or is expected to have very low traffic 
volumes (less than 50 in and out bound trips per day) and is not expected to significantly 
impact safe traffic operations. 
e. ?Shared access has been provided, or the applicant has demonstrated it is not reasonable. 
f. ?Such modification is the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access, will not impair 
public safety or prevent the logical development or redevelopment of adjacent sites and is 
not simply for convenience of the development.

ARTICLE XV. - REDEVELOPMENT READY SITES 


Sec. 50-140. - Redevelopment ready sites. 
(a) ?Due to the age of many of the structures within the city, it is often necessary to create regulations 
which are flexible and allow for minor modifications in the strict enforcement of the zoning ordinance. 
In reviewing the redevelopment of nonconforming nonresidential sites which are being redeveloped 
or have otherwise been removed, destroyed, or otherwise substantially modified; the planning 
commission may modify the following requirements of the ordinance in finding that the modifications 
are appropriate and acceptable since the overall modifications or redevelopment bring the site closer 
to conformance with the intent and regulations of the zoning ordinance: 
(1) ?A structure location which does not meet the required setback provided the location represents 
an overall reduction in the nonconformity and that no easements or rights-of-way are 
encumbered; 
(2) ?Driveways, provided the driveway number, spacing, and general layout provide a more 
beneficial and safe layout and pattern for circulation for vehicles as well as pedestrians; 
(3) ?Size, location and intensity of greenbelt and general landscape requirements; 
(4) ?Parking lot and maneuvering lane paving and curbing requirements. 
(b) ?In modifying these requirements the planning commission shall clearly note as to what the site, 
economic or other conditions are which justify the waiving or modifying of the standard(s). 
(c) ?The planning commission and city council may place appropriate conditions or requirements on any 
waiver or modification of the requirements noted above. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-141. - Process. 
    Any site which seeks approval under this section of the zoning ordinance shall be considered a 
planned unit development and shall be processed as and follow the same review procedures of a special 
land use approval. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-142. - Consistency of uses. 
    Nothing in this section shall permit a use which is not otherwise permissible within the underlying 
zoning district.

(b) ?Open space preservation option. This development option is offered as an alternative means of 
single-family residential development in all of the city's residential districts. The intent of the 
development option is to provide for the creation and preservation of open space areas within 
residential development as mandated in section 506 of Public Act No. 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3506) 
This is to be achieved by allowing for a reduction in the minimum lot area and lot width requirements 
of a residential district, or through the attaching of a one-dwelling unit to another over a limited 
portion of a common party wall. This modification shall be accomplished without any attended 
increase in the number of lots or dwelling units that would be permitted if the property were 
developed in the conventional manner. 
(1) ?Discretionary use of this option. Development of residential zoned property in the city under the 
development alternatives offered in this section shall be at the option of the property owner or 
developer. 
(2) ?Pre-application meeting. Prior to submitting an application to develop property under the 
guidelines of this option, the applicant shall request a pre-application meeting. The purpose of 
the meeting is to acquaint the applicant with how the option works and the potential advantages 
that may be gained from it. If the applicant has prepared a concept plan showing use of the 
option on the property, the plan may be presented at the pre-application meeting. The applicant 
and his or her engineer or designer shall attend the meeting along with city personnel, 
(3) ?Application. An application to develop land under the open space preservation option may be 
obtained from the city building department.

prepared as set forth in this subsection, it may be submitted as the preliminary site plan. 
The preliminary site plan shall: 
1. ?Be superimposed over the existing conditions drawing, and prepared by a registered 
land surveyor, registered civil engineer or a registered landscape architect. 
2. ?Show the location of all proposed streets and alleys and their rights-of-way, utility 
easements, individual lots or home sites and their individual size in square feet, or the 
building footprint for attached dwellings, a typical detailed drawing showing minimum 
required setback dimensions, the area of the open space in square feet or acres and 
the percent the open space makes up of the net usable property acreage. 
3. ?Provide all other applicable information and comply with all the applicable conditions 
set forth in article V and the city's site plan review check list. 
4. ?In the case of attached dwelling units, provide floor plans and exterior building wall 
elevation drawings of a typical dwelling unit showing its common wall relationship to 
the abutting dwelling unit, including any attached garages.

the new development shall join the open space in the abutting development. Such 
open space connections shall not be dead-end open space areas, but shall be 
designed to allow pedestrian and bicycle riding access from one such development to 
another. When a residential open space preservation development abuts a 
commercial development, or undeveloped land that is zoned for commercial use, 
open space of sufficient width to permit connecting the two sites together via a trail or 
pathway, shall be provided. 
6. ?All open space shall be clearly stipulated in any covenants placed on the development 
as area or areas to be set aside in perpetuity as open space. 
k. ?Assurance of open space preservation. The area of the property to be preserved as open 
space shall be subject to the following preservation assurances: 
1. ?Single-family site condominiums. The location of all open space areas shall be 
described by legal description in the master deed. A general description of what the 
open space areas contain will be included. These areas shall be set forth as open 
space areas which are to be preserved as open space areas. 
Open space areas may be identified as common areas, as defined in Public Act No.

bylaws of the association of homeowners, as required in this subsection, shall be 
subject to review and approval by the planning commission. Of particular importance 
to the city shall be assurance that all open space areas are properly set aside for such 
purposes, and those elements of the open space areas that will require maintenance 
will be properly cared for. The city may refer such documents to the city attorney for 
review and comment. The city, at its discretion, may require the assigning of a second 
party to partner with the development in securing the open space areas. A second 
party could be a land conservancy or similar land preservation organization. 
l. ?Life of approvals. The granting of preliminary site plan approval by the planning commission 
shall be good for one year, commencing on the date of approval and terminating on the 
same date one year later. The granting of final site plan approval by the planning 
commission shall be good for one year, commencing on the date of approval and 
terminating on the same date one year later. If after the granting of preliminary site plan 
approval, but before the one year termination date, a revised site plan is submitted and 
approved by the planning commission, the one-year expiration date will be one year from 
the date of revised site plan approval. This same procedure shall apply to time limitations

    The purpose of this section is to serve as a guideline for the establishment of a harmonious building 
wall appearance on all exterior walls of a building so as to create, enhance and promote a uniform and 
quality visual environment throughout the city. 
(1) ?Uniform finish. 
a. ?To ensure that proper and effective attention will be given to the visual appearance of 
nonresidential buildings, all exterior building walls of a new building shall consist of the 
same uniform exterior building wall finish materials as the front wall of the building and all 
such materials used shall be recognized by the building department as acceptable finish 
materials. The color of the exterior building wall materials shall be like or similar to those on 
a majority of the buildings in the surrounding area. 
(2) ?Whenever the exterior building wall materials standards set forth in this section shall apply, 
they shall be accompanied by a statement describing how the exterior building wall material, or 
combination of materials, along with the color of these materials, as set forth in this section, are 
consistent and not visually incompatible, with the materials on a majority of the same type of 
buildings in the surrounding area. For the purpose of this subsection, the following additional 
standards shall apply: 
a. ?A residential dwelling building shall be provided with roof designs, roofing materials, 
exterior finish materials, including doors and windows that are like or directly similar to that 
found on a majority of the residential dwelling buildings in the surrounding area. 
b. ?In the case of a nonresidential building in a residential zoning district, all of the exterior 
walls of the building shall consist of face brick materials and the color of the materials shall 
be like or similar to that of a majority of the buildings in the surrounding area. 
(3) ?These exterior building wall materials guidelines shall apply to the following buildings: 
a. ?Nonresidential buildings. 
1. ?Except where otherwise regulated in this section, the exterior of a nonresidential 
building and any related accessory building shall consist of the following materials 
and/or combinations of materials, and which are like or directly similar to the exterior 
wall materials and color of a majority of the surrounding nonresidential buildings 
(provided they meet the following requirements). 
i. ?Face brick for nonresidential buildings on all exterior walls. 
ii. ?Glazed kiln-baked clay or shale ceramic masonry units, or cut stone or fieldstone, 
when these materials are used only in limited proportions as accent materials. 
iii. ?Precast concrete in form and pattern that may consist of its natural color or may 
be treated (impregnated, not painted) with earth tone colors. 
iv. ?Finished cement like materials, including finished systems and stucco. The use 
of architectural masonry block such as split face, ribbed and rough hewn 
masonry units may be used only as accent materials and may not make up more 
than 25 percent of any exterior wall. 
v. ?Metal materials, including flat sheets, standing seamed or ribbed panels, 
stainless steel and porcelain clad not in excess of 15 percent of the exterior 
building walls. 
2. ?Expressly prohibited materials shall include:

further promote the uniform and quality visual environment of the city. 
ii. ?Meet all applicable requirements of federal, state and local building codes. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-170. - Access through residential zoning districts. 
    Access to a nonresidential use shall not be through or across land zoned for residential use. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-171. - Telecommunication towers. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. It is the general purpose and intent of the city to carry out the will of the United 
States Congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless 
telecommunication systems. However, it is the further purpose and intent of the city to provide for 
such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character, 
property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large. In fashioning and administering the 
provisions of this section, attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests. 
Recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless 
telecommunication services and coverage, it is the further purpose and intent of this section to: 
(1) ?Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless telecommunication facilities. 
(2) ?Establish predetermined districts or zones of the number and shape, and in the location 
considered best for the establishment of wireless telecommunication facilities, subject to 
applicable standards and conditions. 
(3) ?Recognize that the operation of a wireless telecommunication system may require the 
establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts or zones. In such 
cases, it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon 
neighborhoods and areas within the community. Consequently, more stringent standards and 
conditions should apply to the review, approval and use of such facilities. 
(4) ?Ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and 
relationships to other land use, structures and buildings. 
(5) ?Limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid 
adverse impact upon existing population, transportation systems, and other public services and 
facility needs. 
(6) ?Promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
(7) ?Provide for adequate information about plans for wireless telecommunication facilities, in order 
to permit the community to effectively plan for the location of such facilities. 
(8) ?Minimize the adverse impact of technological obsolescence of such facilities, including a 
requirement to remove unused and/or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner. 
(9) ?Minimize the negative visual impact of wireless telecommunication facilities on neighborhoods, 
community landmarks, historic sites and buildings, natural beauty areas and public rights-of-
way. This contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible, and the 
use of structures which are designed for compatibility, including the use of existing structures 
and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary, taking into consideration the 
purposes and intent of this section. 
(10) ?The city council finds that the presence of numerous support structures, particularly if located 
within residential areas, would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and 
integrity of the community. This, in turn, would have an adverse impact upon property values. 
Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous 
relatively tall support structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most 
persons, recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the 
maintenance and promotion of property values, and further recognizing that this economic 
component is an important part of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b) ?Permitted uses. In the following circumstances, a proposal to establish a new wireless 
telecommunication facility shall be deemed a permitted use: 
(1) ?An existing structure which will serve as an attached wireless telecommunication facility within 
a nonresidential zoning district, where the existing structure is not, in the discretion of the 
building official of the city, proposed to be either materially altered or materially changed in 
appearance. 
(2) ?A proposed colocation upon an attached wireless telecommunication facility which had been 
preapproved for such colocation as part of an earlier approval by the city. 
(3) ?An existing structure which will serve as an attached wireless telecommunication facility 
consisting of a utility pole located within a right-of-way, where the existing pole is not proposed 
to be modified in a manner which would materially alter the structure and/or result in an 
impairment of sight lines or other safety interests. 
(4) ?A wireless telecommunication support structure established within a right-of-way having an 
existing width of 204 feet or more. 
(c) ?Special approval land uses. Wireless telecommunication facilities may be authorized as special land 
uses in I-1 Light Industrial Districts. If it is demonstrated by an application that a wireless 
telecommunication facility may not reasonably be established as a permitted use and it is required to 
be established in either an I-1 Light Industrial District or in another zoning district in order to operate 
a wireless telecommunication service, then wireless telecommunication facilities may be permitted 
as a special land use subject to the criteria and standards set forth below. 
(d) ?General regulations. 
(1) ?All applications for wireless telecommunication facilities shall be reviewed in accordance with 
the following standards and conditions, and, if approved, shall be constructed and maintained in 
accordance with such standards and conditions. In addition, if the facility is approved, it shall be 
constructed and maintained with any additional conditions imposed by either the planning 
commission or city council in its discretion: 
a. ?Facilities shall be found to not be injurious to neighborhoods or otherwise detrimental to the 
public safety and welfare. 
b. ?Facilities shall be located and designed to be harmonious with the surrounding areas. 
c. ?Wireless telecommunication facilities shall comply with applicable federal and state 
standards relative to the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.

(1) ?The maximum height of a new or modified support structure and antenna shall be the minimum 
height demonstrated necessary for a reasonable communication by the applicant and other 
entities to colocate on the structure, but not to exceed 120 feet in height, despite any other 
limitations regarding height set forth in section 50-150. The accessory building contemplated to 
enclose such things as switching equipment shall be limited to the maximum height for 
accessory structures within the zoning district. 
(2) ?The setback of the support structure from any residential district shall be at least the height of 
the highest point of any structure on the premises, the setback of the support structure from any 
existing or proposed rights-of-way or other publicly traveled roads shall be no less than the 
height of the structure. 
(3) ?Where the proposed new or modified support structure abuts a parcel of land zoned for a use 
other than residential, the minimum setback of the structure, and accessory structures, shall be 
in accordance with the required setbacks for main or principal buildings as provided in section 
50-151 for the zoning district in which the structure is located. 
(4) ?There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure, for operation, maintenance, repair 
and inspection purposes, which may be provided through or over an easement. This access 
shall have a width and location determined by such factors as the location of adjacent 
thoroughfares and traffic and circulation within the site; utilities needed to service the tower and 
any attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking facilities; proximity to residential 
districts and minimizing disturbance to the natural landscape; and the type of equipment which 
will be needed to access the site. 
(5) ?The division of property for the purpose of locating a wireless telecommunication facility is 
prohibited unless all zoning requirements and conditions are met. 
(6) ?Where an attached wireless telecommunication facility is proposed on the roof of a building, if 
the equipment enclosure is proposed as a roof appliance on the building, it shall be designed, 
constructed and maintained to be architecturally compatible with the principal building. The 
equipment enclosure may be located within the principal building or may be an accessory 
building. If proposed as an accessory building, it shall conform with all district requirements for 
principal, building, including yard setbacks. 
(7) ?The planning commission shall, with respect to the color of the support structure and all 
accessory buildings, review and approve the same so as to minimize distraction, and reduce 
visibility in its surroundings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to maintain the wireless 
telecommunication facility in a neat and orderly condition. 
(8) ?The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable building codes and 
shall include the submission of a soils report from a geotechnical engineer licensed in the state. 
This soils report shall include soil borings and statements confirming the suitability of soil 
conditions for the proposed use. The requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 
the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and the state aeronautics commission, shall be 
noted. 
(9) ?A maintenance plan, and any applicable maintenance agreement, shall be presented and 
approved as part of the site plan for the proposed facility. Such plan shall be designed to ensure 
long term, continuous maintenance to a reasonably prudent standard. 
(f) ?Applications for wireless telecommunication facilities which may be approved as special land uses 
shall be reviewed, and, if approved, shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the 
standards and conditions of this section, and in accordance with the following standards: 
(1) ?The applicant shall demonstrate the need for the proposed facility to be located as proposed 
based upon the presence of one or more of the following factors:

(2) ?The site plan shall also include a detailed landscaping plan where the support structure is 
being placed at a location which is not otherwise developed, or where a developed area will be 
disturbed. The purpose of landscaping is to provide screening and aesthetic enhancement for 
the structure base, accessory buildings and enclosure. In all cases, there shall be shown on the 
plan, fencing, which is required for protection of the support structure and security from children 
and other persons who may otherwise access facilities. 
(3) ?The application shall include a signed certification by a state-licensed professional engineer 
with regard to the manner in which the proposed structure will fall, which certification will be 
utilized, along with other criteria such as applicable regulations for the district in question, in 
determining the appropriate setback to be required for the structure and other facilities. 
(4) ?The application shall include a description of surety to be posed at the time of receiving a 
building permit for the facility to ensure removal of the facility when it has been abandoned or is 
no longer needed. In this regard, the surety shall, at the election of the applicant, be in the form 
of: 
a. ?Cash; 
b. ?A surety bond; 
c. ?A letter of credit; or 
d. ?An agreement in a form approved by the attorney for the city and recordable at the office of 
the register of deeds, establishing a promise of the applicant and owner of the property to 
remove the facility in a timely manner as required under this section, with the further 
provision that the applicant and owner shall be responsible for the payment of any costs 
and attorneys' fees incurred by the community in securing removal. 
(5) ?The application shall include a map showing existing and known proposed wireless 
telecommunication facilities within the city, and further showing existing and known proposed 
wireless telecommunication facilities within areas surrounding the borders of the city in the 
location and in the area, which are relevant in terms of potential colocation or in demonstrating

the city, the applicant shall be required only to update as needed. Any such information which is 
a trade secret and/or other confidential commercial information which, if released, would result 
in commercial disadvantage to the applicant, may be submitted with a request for confidentiality 
in connection with the development of governmental policy, pursuant to MCL 15.243(f). This 
section shall serve as a promise to maintain confidentiality to the extent permitted by law. The 
request for confidentiality must be prominently stated in order to bring it to the attention of the 
city. 
(6) ?The application shall include the name, address and phone number of the person to contact for 
engineering, maintenance and other notice purposes. This information shall be continuously 
updated during the time the facility is on the premises. 
(h) ?For facilities which are not permitted uses under this section, and are proposed to be located 
outside of the Industrial District, an application may be reviewed and, if approved, facilities shall be 
constructed and maintained in accordance with the following additional standards and requirements, 
along with those above: 
(1) ?At the time of the submittal, the applicant shall demonstrate that a location within the Industrial 
District or a colocation cannot reasonably meet the coverage and/or capacity needs of the 
applicant. 
(2) ?Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be of a design such as, without limitation, a steeple, 
bell tower, flag pole, or other form which is compatible with the existing character of the 
proposed site, neighborhood and general area, as approved by the city. 
(3) ?In single-family residential neighborhoods, site locations outside of the Industrial District and 
any permissible collocation area, shall be permitted on the following sites, not stated in any 
order of priority, subject to application of all other standards contained in this section: 
a. ?Municipally owned site. 
b. ?Other governmentally owned site. 
c. ?Religious or other institutional site. 
d. ?Public park and other large permanent open space areas, when compatible. 
e. ?Public or private school sites. 
f. ?Other locations, if none of the locations in this subsection are available. 
(i) ?Colocation . 
(1) ?It is the policy of the city to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for 
wireless telecommunication facilities and wireless telecommunication support structures within 
the community, and to encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless 
telecommunication facility purposes, consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set 
forth in this section. Each licensed provider of a wireless telecommunication facility must, by 
law, be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by 
the United States Congress. However, particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the 
number of wireless telecommunication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of 
the change in Federal law and policy in and relating to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 
1996, it is the policy of the city that all users colocate on attached wireless telecommunication 
facilities and wireless telecommunication support structures in the interest of achieving the 
purposes and intent of this section, as stated above, and as stated in this section. If a provider 
fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by such provider, 
where colocation is feasible, the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure 
will be compelled, in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and 
purpose of the city. The provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage 
conformity with the policy of the city. 
(2) ?Colocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section when all of the following 
are met: 
a. ?The wireless telecommunication provider under consideration for colocation will undertake 
to pay market rent or other market compensation for colocation. 
b. ?The site on which colocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable 
modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural support. 
c. ?The colocation being considered is technologically reasonable, e.g., the colocation will not 
result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustments in 
relation to the structure, antennas, and the like. 
d. ?The height of the structure necessary for colocation will not be increased beyond a point 
deemed to be permissible by the city, taking into consideration the several standards 
contained in this section. 
(j) ?Requirements for colocation. 
(1) ?A special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless telecommunication 
facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible 
colocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs. 
(2) ?All new and modified wireless telecommunication facilities shall be designed and constructed 
so as to accommodate colocation. 
(3) ?The policy of the community is for colocation. Thus, if a person who owns or otherwise controls 
a wireless telecommunication facility fails or refuses to alter a structure so as to accommodate a 
proposed and otherwise feasible colocation, such facility shall not be altered, expanded or 
extended in any respect. 
(4) ?If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless telecommunication facility fails or refuses 
to permit a feasible colocation, and this requires the construction and/or use of a new wireless 
telecommunication support structure, the person failing or refusing to permit a feasible 
colocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and 
purpose of the city, and, consequently, such persons shall take responsibility for the violation, 
and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless telecommunication support 
structure within the city for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit 
the colocation. Such a person may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals 
if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief, which, in 
this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five-year prohibition would 
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless 
telecommunication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the 
provision of personal wireless telecommunication services. 
(k) ?Removal . 
(1) ?A condition of every approval of a wireless telecommunication facility shall be an adequate 
provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners upon the occurrence of

the removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations 
(transmission and/or reception of radio signals), shall be considered as the beginning of a 
period of nonuse. 
b. ?Six months after new technology which is available at reasonable cost as determined by 
the city council, which permits the operation of the communication system without the 
requirement of the support structure. 
(2) ?The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in this section, may be 
applied and limited to portions of a facility. 
(3) ?Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, as specified in this 
section, the property owner or person who had used the facility shall immediately apply or 
secure the application for any required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed 
with and complete the demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable condition as 
reasonably determined by the building official. 
(4) ?If the required removal of a facility, or a portion thereof, has not been lawfully completed within 
60 days of the applicable deadline, and after at least 30 days' written notice, the city may 
remove or secure the removal of the facility, or required portions thereof, with its actual costs 
and reasonable administrative charges to be drawn, collected and/or enforced from or under the 
security posted at the time application was made for establishing the facility.

located, or from the anchors to which any guy wires may be extended to stabilize the tower 
structure, whichever creates the greater setback. 
(2) ?The tower and any buildings or equipment cabinets associated with the facility will be contained 
within a secured compound. 
(3) ?No fencing or other structure designed and intended to secure the facility shall extend into the 
minimum front yard setback requirement of the district.

(1) oversized signs that are out-of-scale with surrounding buildings and structures, and (2) an excessive 
accumulation of signs that would cause visual clutter. These regulations are further intended to regulate

ARTICLE XIX. - OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND LAYOUT STANDARDS 


Sec. 50-220. - General parking requirements. 
    There shall be provided in all districts, at the time of construction or enlargement of any building or 
structure or any new or modified use on a site, off-street parking spaces with adequate access. The 
number of off-street parking spaces as required in this chapter shall be provided prior to the issuance of a 
certificate of occupancy, as prescribed in this article: 
(1) ?Except as permitted in the P-1 Vehicular Parking District, off-street parking shall not be 
permitted as the sole or principal permitted use in any zoning district. 
(2) ?Except as otherwise permitted or restricted, off-street parking spaces and associated vehicle 
maneuvering lanes may be located within a rear yard or within a side yard. 
(3) ?Off-street parking for other than a residential use shall be either on the same lot as the principal 
use, or within 300 feet of the building it is intended to serve. The distance shall be measured 
from the nearest point of the building to the nearest point of the off-street parking lot. All 
residential parking shall be located on the premises it is intended to serve. 
(4) ?No off-street parking for a use in a nonresidential district shall be permitted in a residential 
district, and no off-street parking lot in a nonresidential district shall be accessed through a 
residential district. 
(5) ?Ownership shall be shown for all lots or parcels intended for use as parking by the applicant. 
(6) ?Required off-street parking for single-family and two-family dwellings may be provided in a 
stacking configuration in a driveway or garage, or combination thereof. 
(7) ?Required off-street parking for all multiple family or nonresidential use shall consist of an 
unencumbered parking stall or strip, parking bay, vehicle maneuvering space, driveway or 
garage, or combination thereof. Parking garages or structures, when accessory to a principal 
use, shall be subject to the applicable provisions of section 50-160. 
(8) ?Minimum required off-street parking spaces shall not be replaced by any other use unless and 
until equal parking facilities are provided elsewhere. 
(9) ?Off-street parking existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is 
derived, used in connection with the operation of an existing building or use, shall not be 
reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or new use. Any 
permitted expansion, alteration or change of use which increases the required number of 
parking spaces shall require a corresponding increase in the number of spaces provided subject 
to appropriate review and approval requirements. 
(10) ?Two or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the number of required off-street 
parking spaces, in which case the required number of parking spaces shall not be less than the 
sum of the requirements for the several individual uses computed separately. In the instance of 
dual function of off-street parking spaces where operating hours of buildings do not overlap, the 
planning commission may grant an exception to the total space requirement. 
(11) ?The sale, renting, leasing, storage or repair of any construction trailers, merchandise or motor 
vehicles, or trailers for sale or rent, is prohibited on off-street parking lots, except where law 
permits the sale of vehicles in an off-street parking lot owned by the owner of the vehicle that is 
for sale. 
(12) ?For those uses not specifically mentioned, the requirements for off-street parking facilities 
shall be in accordance with a use which the planning commission or building official considers 
being of a similar nature. 
(13) ?When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in a 
fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions 
over one-half shall require one parking space. 
(14) ?For the purpose of computing the number of parking spaces required, the applicable definition 
of usable floor area (floor area, usable) shall apply. 
(15) ?Wherever the city council shall establish off-street parking facilities by means of a special 
assessment district or by any other means, the city council may determine, upon completion 
and acceptance of such off-street parking facilities, that all existing buildings and uses and all 
buildings erected or uses established thereafter within the special assessment district or 
districts, may be exempt from the requirements of this article for privately supplied off-street 
parking facilities. 
(16) ?The minimum number of off-street parking spaces by type of use shall be determined in 
accordance with the following requirements. The planning commission may reduce the total 
number of parking or vehicle stacking spaces for drive thru facilities, being provided based on 
the type of use that is being conducted and the physical constraints of the property. The 
planning commission may also allow for a "payment in lieu of parking." The "fee" to be paid for 
each parking space shall be determined by city council and adopted by resolution. The fee may 
be reviewed and adjusted from time to time to reflect current market rates and estimated 
construction costs. The payment shall be dedicated for improving and developing parking 
spaces within the city's business and industrial districts.

Sec. 50-221. - Off-street parking space layout standards, construction and maintenance. 
    Whenever the off-street parking requirements set forth in this chapter, require the establishment of 
an off-street parking lot, such off-street parking lots shall be laid out, constructed and maintained in 
accordance with the following standards: 
(1) ?No parking lot shall be constructed or an existing parking lot improved, until a site plan has 
been reviewed and approved in accordance with article V. 
(2) ?Except for single-family and two-family residential uses, adequate lighting shall be provided 
throughout nighttime hours when the parking area is in operation. All lighting shall conform to 
the requirements or section 50-162. 
(3) ?Adequate ingress and egress to the parking lot shall be provided and shall be designed in 
accordance with applicable local, county or state guidelines. 
(4) ?The planning commission may require the joining of parking lots in order to reduce the number 
of curb cuts onto a public street and to facilitate movement between sites. The planning 
commission may also require a joint access and/or cross access easement to be filed 
guaranteeing the rights of mutual access. 
(5) ?All parking spaces shall be clearly striped with all appropriate lines, symbols and markings. 
(6) ?Except for parallel parking, when the front of a parking space abuts a raised (curbed) private 
sidewalk that is not less than seven feet in width or a adequately sized landscaped area, two 
feet may be credited toward the total required parking space length. 
(7) ?Except for single-family and two-family uses, all parking spaces shall have access from clearly 
defined maneuvering lanes not less than 12 feet wide for a one-way lane and 22 feet wide for a 
two-way lane. 
(8) ?The required number, size, spacing and layout of handicapped parking spaces shall be 
determined by state rules and regulations. 
(9) ?Parking spaces, except for parallel spaces, shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and 20 feet 
in length. Parallel parking spaces shall be a minimum of 23 feet in length. 
(10) ?Backing directly into a public street right-of-way shall be prohibited. Backing directly into an 
alley right-of-way is permitted, provided the alley is hard-surfaced, in good repair and the width 
of the alley right-of-way is adequate to meet vehicle maneuvering. 
(11) ?Bumper stops, curbing, or wheel blocks, at least six inches in height, shall be provided to 
prevent any vehicle from damaging or encroaching upon any required wall, fence, buffer strips, 
parking lot landscape islands/areas, or upon any building adjacent to the parking lot. The use of 
commercial truck bumper blocks (i.e., blocks that exceed six inches in height) and freeway-type 
guardrails shall be prohibited. 
(12) ?All required parking spaces, drives and aisles shall be hard-surfaced with concrete or asphalt, 
except for such seasonal and transient uses as public or private parks, carnivals, and like uses. 
(13) ?Except for single-family residential uses, all new or reconstructed hard-surfaced parking areas 
shall be constructed with concrete curbs and gutters, at least six inches in height. If an existing 
parking area is being expanded and the existing parking area does not include curb and gutter, 
the planning commission may vary or waive the requirement. 
(14) ?All interior and abutting streets shall have rights-of-way of a sufficient width to accommodate 
the vehicular traffic generated by the uses permitted in the district or adequate provision shall 
be made at the time of the approval of the parking plan for such sufficient width of rights-of-way. 
(15) ?Off-street parking areas shall be drained so as to dispose of all surface water accumulated in 
the parking area to prevent drainage onto adjacent property or toward buildings. Parking lot 
drainage shall be reviewed based on acceptable and best management engineering practices 
by the city engineer. 
(16) ?Maneuvering lanes serving angle parking shall permit one-way traffic movements only. Lanes 
serving right angle parking shall permit two-way movement. The mixing of one-way and two-
way movements within a lot shall be permitted only in exceptional instances. 
(17) ?Dead-end off-street parking aisles are discouraged. Dead end aisles shall be no more than 
eight spaces deep on any side and may be used only when there is no reasonable alternative. If 
more than eight spaces deep on any side, the parking layout shall provide an adequate means 
for vehicles to turn around. 
   
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013; Ord. No. 1120, §§ 1, 2, 5-19-2015) 


Sec. 50-222. - Off-street loading and unloading. 
    On the same premises with every building involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials 
or merchandise, or in an improved public alley that directly abuts the property, there shall be provided and 
maintained adequate space for loading and unloading in order to avoid undue interference with the public 
use of dedicated streets and parking areas. Such space shall be provided as follows: 
(1) ?All spaces shall be at least ten feet by 50 feet, with a clearance of at least 14 feet in height for 
uses in the B-1 Community Business District, B-2 Central Business District, B-3 General 
Business District and I-1 Light Industrial District. The planning commission may allow for a 
reduced loading space size and configuration based upon the type of use or trucks anticipated 
utilizing the site. 
(2) ?Loading dock approaches shall be asphalt or cement so as to provide a permanent durable 
and dustless surface. Dedicated loading spaces may be enclosed within a building. 
(3) ?Access to a loading space shall be arranged so as to provide sufficient off-street maneuvering 
space as well as adequate ingress to and from a street or service drive that will not require the 
backing of a truck directly onto or off of a public street right-of-way. 
(4) ?Unless otherwise indicated, loading space is permitted in a rear yard only. When it can be 
shown that a different location is necessitated by site conditions, loading spaces may be 
permitted in an interior side yard. 
(5) ?Loading spaces shall be distinct from, and shall not interfere with, parking aisles, maneuvering 
lanes, or parking spaces. 
(6) ?Loading and unloading spaces shall be effectively screened from view from any public street 
and from any office or residential zoning district in a manner acceptable to the planning 
commission; this may include landscaping, screen wall, fencing, etc. 
(7) ?In the B-1, B-2, B-3, I-1 and I-2 districts, off-street loading and unloading shall be provided 
according to the following provisions: 
a. ?For uses with a gross floor area of less than 20,000 square feet, one loading space shall 
be provided. 
b. ?For uses with a gross floor area from 20,000 to 100,000 square feet, one loading space 
shall be provided plus one space for each additional 50,000 square feet. 
c. ?For uses with a gross floor area from 100,000 to 500,000 square feet, three loading spaces 
shall be provided plus one space for each 50,000 square feet in excess of 100,001 square 
feet. 
d. ?For automobile service stations, required loading space may be located in any yard. 
e. ?The planning commission may reduce or otherwise eliminate the requirement for a loading 
space upon a finding that the space cannot physically be located on the site or that the 
particular use does not require such a space.

ARTICLE XX. - SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING 


Sec. 50-230. - Intent. 
    Walls, earth berms, planting screens or combinations, are intended to provide forms of buffering 
which will provide a more compatible, safer and visually attractive physical separation of various land use 
types. Where necessary, these devices are intended to create a definitive site improvement, thereby 
minimizing the impact that one type of land use may have on another. General landscaping enhances the 
appearance, character and value of property while having a positive impact on the community. 
Landscaping breaks up masses of paved and building area and provides a cooling effect, encourages the 
preservation of existing vegetation where possible, and can provide a physical separation between 
pedestrian and vehicle traffic. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-231. - Screening devices required. 
    A screening device or combinations of screening devices, as permitted and regulated in this section, 
are required for those zoning districts and uses listed in this section and whenever there is a change in 
ownership or tenancy, There shall be provided and maintained a screening device or combination of 
screening devices on those sides abutting or adjacent to a residential zoning district and between any off-
street parking spaces and a public right-of-way.

    Existing walls which exceed the above noted heights may be maintained and shall not be considered 
to be nonconforming in nature. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-232. - Screen walls. 
    Prior to the construction of any wall as required in this section, appropriate plans and specifications 
shall be provided for review and approval by the planning commission. 
(1) ?Screen walls shall consist of face brick, stone, colorfast poured in place concrete with brick 
etched exterior surfaces, or colorfast architectural masonry panels with matching concrete 
posts. The planning commission may approve other alternative materials upon a finding that the 
materials are of similar quality, durability and appearance. 
(2) ?Screen walls shall be located on the lot line. Exceptions may be made by the planning 
commission where underground utilities interfere. This chapter requires conformity with front 
yard setback lines in abutting residential districts or where the planning commission determines 
an alternative location is appropriate. 
(3) ?Required walls along the rear of a nonresidential zoning district that is separated from a 
residential zoning district by a public alley right-of-way shall be located on the residential side of 
the alley right-of-way along the inside edge of the public alley right-of-way or utility easement 
next to the residential property. 
(4) ?Except where a greater minimum setback is called for in the P-1 Vehicle Parking District, or by 
the restricted clear corner vision requirements of section 50-164. No screen wall shall extend 
closer than ten feet, to any property line intersected by any public right-of-way, driveway or any 
property line which lies adjacent to public right-of-way or driveway. 
(5) ?Screen walls shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or for other purposes, except as 
otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(6) ?All screen walls shall be maintained in a safe, upright and attractive condition. 
(7) ?Once a screen wall is constructed on a common line, all subsequently constructed screen walls 
shall be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and shall consist of like materials 
and construction with the previously constructed screen wall unless the planning commission 
determines the existing wall type is undesirable to maintain and continue. 
(8) ?If it is determined that the residential district is a future nonresidential area, the planning 
commission may temporarily waive the screen wall requirements of this section for an initial 
period not to exceed 12 months. The granting of subsequent waivers may be permitted, 
provided that the planning commission shall again make the same determination for each 
subsequent waiver request. 
(9) ?A detail cross section drawing of the screen wall structure shall be submitted with any 
development plan proposing construction of a screen wall structure and shall identify the 
exterior building wall material to be used on the wall and the color of the material. Colors shall 
be of a colorfast nature and shall be limited to earth tone colors, or the color of the exterior 
building walls of the principal building on the site. 
(10) ?The planning commission may approve alterative screening mechanisms such as a fence, 
berm, landscaping, etc., in lieu of the construction of a wall. The alternative screening 
mechanism shall have the same screening effect as the construction of a wall. 
(11) ?The planning commission shall have the authority to review and approve minor amendments 
to the requirements for a masonry and/or screening wall required by this section. The planning 
commission, in determining whether to allow a minor amendment, shall follow the conditions 
outlined below: 
a. ?Minor amendments may include: 
1. ?The overall height (below that normally required) or the height in certain areas (below 
that normally required) where clear vision may be obstructed or a taller height may not 
be desirable due to lot or building configuration, no structure or use to screen, etc. 
2. ?The location and extent of the wall along a property line or right-of-way may justify a 
minor amendment. 
b. ?The planning commission does not have the authority to waive the requirement for a wall in 
its entirety. The zoning board of appeals has the authority to vary the requirement for a 
screen wall in its entirety. 
(12) ?The building department shall give 15 days' notice prior to the planning commission meeting 
date of any proposed or required wall or similar screening mechanism to be constructed along a 
residentially used or zoned property. Notice shall be provided to the legal owner of the property. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-233. - Earth berms. 
    An earth berm screen may be used as an alternative to an architectural masonry screen wall, 
provided the earth berm is found by the planning commission to be at least an equally effective alternative 
to a masonry wall at the location it is proposed. 
    Berms may be constructed consistent with the following guidelines: 
 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-234. - Screening between parking lots and public rights-of-way. 
(a) ?A minimum five-foot wide landscape greenbelt shall be provided between any parking lot and any 
road or street right-of-way. The planning commission may waive or modify this requirement based on 
existing site conditions or existing limited parking conditions. 
(b) ?Except as otherwise specified within the restricted clear corner vision triangle requirements of 
section 50-164 and in this section, the height of any permitted screening device or combination of 
screening devices, shall be in accordance with the following guidelines.

(c) ?Where the width of a greenbelt may be increased to improve its continuity with a longer greenbelt, 
the height of the screening device may exceed the height limitations of subsection (b) of this section, 
except nothing in this section shall prohibit the planting of deciduous trees within the panel in 
addition to, but not in place of, any required screening device. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-235. - Aesthetically designed landscaping features. 
(a) ?At least ten percent of the net usable area of a development site (less area occupied by buildings) 
shall be devoted to landscaping. Any peripheral land area occupied by a required earth berm or 
landscape screening device used to satisfy the applicable site screening requirements of this article 
may be counted as part of the site area landscaping obligation. 
(b) ?In addition to, or in conjunction with the minimum percent of landscaped site area required in 
section 50-235(a), off-street parking lots shall provide one tree for every five parking spaces. 
(c) ?All parking lot and street frontage trees required by the standards of this section shall be large 
deciduous trees. 
(d) ?Parking lot trees generated by the standards of this section shall be distributed as evenly as 
physically possible throughout the parking area, but emphasis shall be given to placing the trees at 
the ends of parking rows to enhance traffic circulation within the parking lot. 
(e) ?Parking lot trees shall be located in raised curb planting beds containing at least 150 square feet of 
area, and no tree shall be planted in such a bed closer than four feet from any raised curb line. 
(f) ?All parking lot landscaping shall consist of live plant material and mulch. Mulch shall not include lava, 
pebbles, or any kind of stones or rocks. 
(g) ?Street trees shall be required to be planted at a rate of one tree for each 30 feet of street frontage. 
(h) ?All other landscaping materials placed on property for aesthetic purposes and which are not 
required to satisfy any planting requirements of this article, shall be placed on the property in a 
manner that will enhance the appearance of the site and not interfere with the safe and efficient flow 
of pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic. 
(i) ?On-site landscape features which may be counted towards meeting the minimum site landscaping 
area requirement set forth in subsection (a) of this section, may include architectural sidewalk 
treatments consisting of decorative brick pavers, etc and which are used for more than merely 
gaining access to and from the site/building. 
(j) ?Where appropriate and feasible, landscape sprinklers shall be provided in all areas where live plant 
material is planned. 
(k) ?The planning commission may waive or modify this requirement based on existing site conditions or 
existing limited site and parking conditions. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-236. - Trash receptacles and climate control systems screening. 
    Any new or altered land use which has a need for a trash receptacle and exposed climate control 
equipment requires submittal of a site plan for review by the planning commission as set forth and 
regulated in this chapter and shall comply with the following applicable requirements: 
(1) ?Screening trash receptacles. 
a. ?All refuse to be disposed of shall consist only of nonhazardous waste materials generated 
by the use or uses for which the trash receptacle is intended. 
b. ?All refuse shall be placed in an approved receptacle and the receptacle shall be kept within 
an approved screening structure. 
c. ?The screen wall structure shall be six feet in height. Gates shall consist of wood or 
composite materials. Permitted materials where possible, shall consist of the same 
material and the same color as the front facade of the principal use of the site, except in 
those instances were the trash receptacle screen wall is to be made an integral part of a 
required architectural masonry screen wall structure. 
d. ?In no instance shall any refuse be visible above the screen wall structure and no refuse 
shall be stored between the walls of a trash receptacle and the walls of its screening 
structure. 
e. ?The floor of a trash receptacle screen wall structure shall consist of a reinforced concrete 
material built to applicable city codes and shall extend outward from the front gate of the 
screen wall structure a distance of ten feet across the full width of the structure. 
f. ?Bollards and/or other protective measures shall be installed as needed to adequately 
protect the screen wall structure. 
g. ?Trash receptacles shall be restricted to locations within the rear yard, except in the case of 
a corner or double frontage lot, the receptacle may, with planning commission approval, be 
located within an interior side yard. If it becomes necessary to place a trash receptacle in 
an interior side yard, it shall be placed as far from any residential dwelling as physically 
possible. 
h. ?Trash receptacles shall be placed so that they can be efficiently approached and serviced. 
i. ?Trash receptacles shall be maintained in a clean and orderly manner as well as the screen 
wall structure and its interior area. 
(2) ?Screening climate control equipment. 
a. ?When climate control equipment is placed on a flat roof of a building, it shall be located to 
the interior of the roof and out of sight from ground eye level. When climate control 
equipment must be placed at or near the edge of a flat roof building, it shall be screened 
from view with architectural screening material, but not including fencing, or by the upward 
continuation of the exterior building wall material along the wall edge the equipment will be 
next to or near, with the remaining sides screened with architectural material. 
b. ?When placed on top of a building with a pitched roof, all climate control equipment so 
located shall be effectively screened from view with architectural screening material, but 
not including fencing. 
c. ?When placed on the ground, climate control equipment shall be placed in the rear yard 
area next to the building it is designed to serve. In the instance of a corner or double 
frontage lot, climate control equipment may, with planning commission approval, be 
located in an interior side yard next to the building it is designed to serve. 
d. ?When placed on the ground all climate control equipment shall be effectively screened, 
including all electrical control panels and boxes, with the same masonry materials used on 
the exterior face of the building walls, or by screen planting materials. When landscape 
planting materials are used, they shall be of a type that will create an immediate, year-
round screening device. All such landscaping materials shall be maintained in a living 
growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-237. - Seasonal planting guidelines. 
    Whenever landscaping is required, either as part of a planting screen or as part of any general 
aesthetic site landscaping, all landscaping shall be planted in accordance with the following guidelines: 
(1) ?If a use is ready for occupancy between April 1 and September 30, a certificate of occupancy 
may be issued by the city. All landscape planting materials shall be planted within 30 days from 
the date of issuance of an occupancy permit. If a use is ready for occupancy between October 1 
and March 31, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the city. If necessary, the 
city may allow all landscape planting materials be planted within 60 days after March 31. Failure 
to have all planting materials planted within these time frames shall be grounds for revoking or 
terminating the occupancy permit. If the occupancy permit has been revoked or terminated, no 
additional certificate of occupancy, either temporary or final, shall be issued until all required 
landscape planting materials have been planted. 
(2) ?A period of establishment shall start upon completion of all planting and shall continue through

ARTICLE XXI. - NONCONFORMING USES 


Sec. 50-240. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures or uses to continue until 
they are removed. However, it is also the intent of this chapter to provide for their gradual elimination. It is 
recognized that there exist within the districts established by this chapter and subsequent amendments 
thereto, lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed 
or amended which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future 
amendments. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the 
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged 
upon, expanded or extended, nor used as ground for adding other structures or uses prohibited 
elsewhere in the same district. Moreover, a nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of 
land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged 
after passage of this chapter by the attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to 
be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would not be permitted 
in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a 
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was 
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which 
actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction includes placing 
construction materials in a permanent position and fastening them in a permanent manner, except that 
where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to 
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall 
be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-241. - Nonconforming lots. 
    Except as may be otherwise permitted if any lot in a subdivision plat of record on the date of 
enactment of this chapter does not meet the minimum area and bulk requirements as stated herein, such 
lot may receive a building permit under hardship conditions so long as all other applicable requirements of 
this chapter are met. 
    However, if contiguous vacant lots are commonly owned, no hardship condition shall exist based on 
this section and a proper combination of the lots, or portions thereof, must be made in order to create a 
building site or sites which meet the minimum area and bulk requirements for the district. If any lot or lots, 
or any portion or portions thereof, are included within the boundaries of a building site for the purpose of 
securing issuance of a building permit under this section, no portion shall at any time be taken into 
consideration in the calculations of minimum area and bulk requirements for any other building site. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-242. - Nonconforming uses of land. 
    Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lawful use of land exists that 
is made no longer permissible such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject 
to the following provisions: 
(1) ?No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, or extended to occupy a greater 
area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the 
ordinance. 
(2) ?No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or 
parcels occupied by such use. 
(3) ?If a nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of 12 consecutive months or 
for 18 months during any three-year period, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to 
the regulations specified for the district in which the land is located. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-243. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that 
could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, 
yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so 
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions: 
(1) ?Except as otherwise permitted in the section, no such structure may be enlarged or altered in a 
way that will increase its nonconformity, but may be enlarged or altered in a way that does not 
increase its nonconformity. 
(2) ?Except as otherwise permitted in this section, should a nonconforming structure be destroyed 
by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its true cash value, exclusive of its 
foundation, the nonconforming portion of the structure shall be removed and the structure may 
be reconstructed only in a way that conforms with the applicable requirements of this chapter. 
(3) ?In the instance where a nonconforming element of an otherwise conforming structure, such as 
but not necessarily limited to, a front or rear porch, alcove, raised deck, or structure erected to 
accept the physically handicapped, is destroyed, or is rebuilt, remodeled or replaced, it may be 
replaced by a like or different structure, that is serving the same purpose, so long as the 
horizontal shape and size of the replacement will not exceed the horizontal size and shape of 
the structure it is replacing. 
(4) ?Should a nonconforming structure, or any nonconforming element of a structure be moved for 
any reason, it shall thereafter conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-244. - Nonconforming uses of structures and land. 
    If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of 
adoption or amendment of this chapter the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise 
lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?No existing structure or land devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in 
which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or 
structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district 
in which it is located. 
(2) ?Any nonconforming use of a structure and/or land may be changed to another nonconforming 
use of the same or more restricted classification, provided that the zoning board of appeals, 
either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, finds that the proposed use is 
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In 
permitting such change, the board may require conditions and safeguards in accordance with 
the purpose and intent of this chapter. Where a nonconforming use of a structure and/or land is 
hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not be changed back to a less conforming 
use. 
(3) ?Any structure and/or land, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted 
use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located, and the 
nonconforming use may not be resumed. 
(4) ?When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination is discontinued 
or ceases to exist for 12 consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period, the 
structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used, except in 
conformance with the regulation of the district in which it is located. Structures occupied by 
seasonal uses shall be excepted from this provision, unless such a use is not utilized during a 
normal seasonal use period. 
(5) ?When a nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or 
destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-245. - Repairs and maintenance. 
(a) ?On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any 
period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing 
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the assessed value of the 
building. 
(b) ?Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition 
any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public 
safety, upon order of such official. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-246. - Change of tenancy or ownership. 
    There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming use of 
land, of structures or of structures and land in combination. 
(Ord. No. 1080, 4-16-2013) 


Sec. 50-247. - Purchase or condemnation. 
    The city may acquire, by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, private property or an interest in 
private property, for the removal of nonconforming uses. The cost and expense, or a portion thereof, of 
acquiring the private property may be paid from general funds or assessed to a special district in 
accordance with the applicable statutory provisions relating to the creation and operation of a special 
assessment district for public improvements in the city. The elimination of the nonconforming uses and 
structures in a zoning district is declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use. The city council 
may institute and prosecute proceedings for condemnation of nonconforming uses and structures under 
the power of eminent domain in accordance with Public Act No. 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3101 et seq.)
