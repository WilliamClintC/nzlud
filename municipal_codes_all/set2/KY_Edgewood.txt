connected with and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is
apparent that Council would not have enacted the remaining parts without the
unconstitutional part, or unless the remaining parts, standing alone, are
incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the intent of
Council.

   (C)   An amended ordinance without a delayed effective date remains
unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting
of Council which enacted the amendment.



   (D)   An amended ordinance with a delayed effective date remains
unchanged with respect to that amendment if the ordinance making the
amendment is repealed at the same or at a subsequent meeting of Council as
long as the repealing ordinance takes effect prior to the effective date of
the original amendment.

amendment shall have the effect of reviving the original language of the

any offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, except that the proceedings thereafter had shall
conform, so far as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such
proceedings.  If any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any
provision of the new ordinance, such provision may, by the consent of the
party affected, be applied to any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance
takes effect.

program of the office, department, or agency concerned and may revise, alter,

allotments shall not exceed the total appropriation available to that office,

   (B)   The Budget Officer shall certify a copy of the allotments
approved to the Chief Financial Officer who shall authorize all expenditures
for the offices, departments, and agencies to be made from the appropriations
on the basis of approved allotments and not otherwise.  The approved
allotment may be revised during the budget year in the same manner as the
original allotment was made.



   (C)   If, at any time during the budget year the Budget Officer
shall ascertain that the available income, plus balances, for the year will

(KRS 61.870)



PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS



§ 36.05  INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.



   (A)   As defined in § 36.01, and subject to the limitations set
forth in § 36.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records
of the city shall make a request or complete a written application for such
records at the office of the City Clerk during regular office hours, except
during legal holidays.  The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or
sent via facsimile to the City Clerk's office. (KRS 61.872 (2))



   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person's request is in
compliance with the open records law and the requested records are
immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection.  Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of
the City Clerk for the inspection.  No person shall remove original copies
of public records from the offices of any public agency without the written
permission of the official custodian of the record.  (KRS 61.872(1))



   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular
business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from
the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or principal place of
business is outside of the county in which the city is located and he has
precisely described public records which are available within the city. If
the person requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed,
the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the
cost of mailing.  (KRS 61.872(3))



   (D)   The applicant shall have  the right to make  abstracts of
the public records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by
this chapter.  When copies are requested, the custodian may require a
written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
36.01.  (KRS 61.874(1))



   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the 
agency  currently  maintains  the  records  in  electronic format. 
Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in
standard hard copy format where agencies currently maintain records in hard
copy format.  Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format records
to electronic formats.



   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as
not less than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white
paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard
Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format.  If the public agency
maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this
format conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be
provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified
by the public agency.  Any request for a public record in a form other than
the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.



(KRS 61.874(2)(b))



   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.  The public
agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a
commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the requestor
stating the commercial purpose for which  they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency.  The
contract shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial
purpose for a specified fee.  The fee may be based on the cost to the public
agency of media, mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy
of the public record or records or the cost to the public agency of the
creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public records.



(KRS 61.874 (4))



   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part
of a public record for a:



      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial
purpose, if a certified statement from the  requestor was required by the
public agency pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or



      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or



      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a commercial purpose.  A newspaper,
periodical, radio or television station shall not be held to have used or
knowingly allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose
merely because of its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its
express permission for that commercial use.



(KRS 61.874 (5))



   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as
provided under this section, may be provided and made available at the
discretion of the public agency.  If a party wishes to access public records
by electronic means and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a
public agency may require that the party enter into a contract, license, or
other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. 
Fees shall not exceed:



      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and
reasonable cost of computer time access charges;



      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a
reasonable fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).



(KRS 61.874(6))



§ 36.06  REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.



   If the City Clerk does not have custody or control of the public record
or records requested, the City Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall
furnish the name and location of the custodian of the public record.



(KRS 61.872(4))



§ 36.07  PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.



   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant

intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records.  However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.  (KRS 61.872(6))

a statement of the specific exception authorizing the  withholding  of

General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole
or in part, the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute
appeal proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory
relief in the circuit court.  In addition, if the Attorney General disallows
the request, or if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding
the Attorney General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes
proceedings in circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of
such action.  (KRS 61.880, 61.882)

confidentially disclosed to an agency or required by an agency to be
disclosed to it, generally recognized  as confidential or proprietary, which

disclosed to an agency or required by an agency to be disclosed to it,

adjudication.  Unless exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public
records exempted under this provision shall be open after enforcement action
is completed or a decision is made to take no action.  The exemptions
provided by this subdivision shall not be used by the custodian of the
records to delay or impede the exercise of rights granted by this chapter.

§ 70.15  SIGNAL LEGENDS.

traffic-control sign or signs exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or
"Stop," or exhibiting different colored lights for purposes of traffic
control, the following colors only shall be used, and these terms and lights
shall indicate and be obeyed as follows:



   (A)   Green alone or "Go":  Vehicular traffic facing the signal may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn.  However, vehicular traffic shall yield the
right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.



   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the
green or "Go" signal:  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is
thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a
red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular
traffic shall not enter the intersection.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady
yellow signal may enter and clear the intersection.



   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop":  Vehicular traffic facing
the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an
intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible
line, and shall remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.



   (D)   Flashing red alone:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at
such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not
again proceed until it can do so without danger.



   (E)   Flashing yellow alone:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall reduce its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection
controlled by such signal.



   (F)   "Yield Right-of-Way":  Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield
Right-of-Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering
the primary intersecting or merging right-of-way.  All traffic facing the
sign shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such
primary intersecting or merging right-of-way.  No vehicle facing a "Yield
Right-of-Way" sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a
speed in excess of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not
apply to vehicles entering an expressway.



   (G)   Lane lights:  When lane lights are installed over any street
for the purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular
traffic shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. 
However, when flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall
be made from that lane.  Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles
shall not move against them.  If flashing yellow lights show above a lane,
that lane shall be used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at
such place prohibits such turn.

approved by the city.



   (B)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to

TRAFFIC SAFETY POLICY



§ 70.30  DEFINITIONS.



   As used herein, the following words and phrases have the meanings
indicated therefor:



   "ANYBODY, EVERYBODY and NOBODY."   Any, every and no human being, or
any organization or combination thereof, in the form of a corporation,
partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association or otherwise.



   "MOTOR VEHICLE."   Any wheeled vehicle propelled by any means other
than gravity or muscular power.



(Ord. 2001-08-10, passed 9-10-01)



§ 70.31  TRAFFIC SAFETY POLICY.



   The city is committed to a procedure of progressive steps that are
designed to reasonably insure the safety of citizens while on public
right-of-ways.  These steps are intended to supplement the good personal
safety habits of citizens and to insure the consistent and equal response to
traffic safety issues throughout the city.



   (A)   Phase One.   The first step when a complaint is received is
that it be recorded and then investigated by the police.  The method of
investigation should be up to the police; either a radar car or the unmanned
radar trailer would be used.



   (B)   Phase Two.   Based on the data collected in Phase One the
next step, assuming a problem does exist, would be toe establish a
neighborhood meeting conducted by the Police Department.  The intent is to
provide a source of traffic safety education and to gather consensus on
dealing with the problem.  The consensus solution should then be
implemented.  Results should be reported back to the group and City Council.



      (1)   Traffic Signs.   The City Administrator, upon the
recommendation of the Police Chief, may request the installation of no
parking or stop signs as temporary relief to a particular traffic problem. 
The City Administrator shall notify the City Council of such installation in
the next monthly administrator's report following such installation.  The
appropriate ordinances shall be submitted to City Council at the first
meeting of December each year for the purpose of adding these locations to
the respective permanent sign authorization ordinances.



   (C)   Phase Three.   The third and final phase of response would
be the use of extraordinary measures such as directional regulation, closing
a street, a traffic light or the installation of speed humps or traffic
control signs.  Speed bumps are not an acceptable option.  The following
general criteria must be met before implementation of Phase Three control
measures could even be considered.  The required criteria must be met before
the staff would forward any such request to City Council for their
consideration.



      (1)   One Way or Dead End Streets.   A petition from ninety
percent (90%) of the residents living on an impacted street would be required
before City Council would consider making a street one way or closing one end
to make it a dead end street.  Such a petition would only be considered if
the city engineer had been able to identify a significant benefit that would
result from such action and this benefit would help to solve the problem at
hand without creating other significant problems.



      (2)   Speed Humps.   Speed humps will only be used on
collector streets.  They must be at least five hundred twenty-eight (528)
feet apart.  They can only be installed if seventy-five percent (75%) of the
residents located within one quarter (¼) of a mile one thousand three
hundred twenty (1,320) feet of the proposed site of the hump agree.  The
distance would be calculated to include any contiguous right of way within
the required distance.



      (3)   Traffic Signal.   The standard state "traffic
warrants" must be met before a traffic signal will be considered.

   (B)   Any person who violates § 71.35 shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty ($250.00) or
imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days, or both. (KRS 189.378)



   (C)   Each violation and every other failure to comply with the
provisions of §§ 70.30-70.33 shall be a misdemeanor, for which everybody
convicted thereof, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be sentenced
to pay a criminal fine, not to exceed the maximum amount of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) as set forth in



KRS 534.040(2).



(Ord. 2001-08-10, passed 9-10-01)



   (D)   Each and every violation of the parking prohibitions listed in
Chapter 76, Sch. I, shall be a separate offense for which the civil penalty
authorized by KRS 82.600 to 82.640 shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00),

finality of a factual determination that the parking violation identified in
the citation was committed.

on residential and non-residential properties with and without structures,
and prohibiting public nuisances that substantially annoy, injure, or
endanger the public or unlawfully or substantially interfere with the use and
enjoyment of private or public property, and fixing the responsibilities of
owners, operators, and occupants of all residential and non-residential
structures, and premises.

   (C)   Application of other codes. Any repairs, alterations, or

Edgewood, including but not limited to the adopted Property Maintenance Code,
the Kentucky Building Code, Fire Code, and Electrical Code.



   (D)   Conflict with other ordinances or regulations. In any case
where a provision of this Code is found to be in conflict with any existing
code, ordinance, or regulation of the City of Edgewood, the provision that
establishes the highest standard shall apply, so long as the penalty for
violation of that provision is civil in nature. If the penalty of the
provision establishing the highest standard is not civil in nature, then this

Building Code, Fire Code, and Electrical Code, which shall control over
conflicting City of Edgewood ordinances.

its officers or agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any

time, the nature of the building (e.g., a multi-family apartment house), the
condition of the entire area, or other reasonable legislative or
administrative standards adopted by the county. Probable cause does not need
to depend upon specific knowledge of a condition existing in a particular
dwelling. A Code Enforcement Officer conducting an inspection pursuant to
this chapter shall provide identification and statement of purpose before
entering any building, structure, dwelling, or premises and the person in
possession or in charge of the building, structure, dwelling, or premises

written notice from the City Administrative Officer, within thirty (30) days
after an application for a business regulatory license required by this

            2.   The relationship of the crime to the purposes
of the regulation of the business.



            3.   The relationship of the crime to the ability,
capacity and fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the
responsibilities of the operation of the business.

BUSINESS OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE FEE



§ 110.30  LEVY; IMPOSITION.



   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses
of the city and the municipal services and functions provided thereby, and
subject to the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, an occupational
license fee is hereby levied and imposed upon everybody engaged in any
franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business in the city, for
the privilege of that engagement.



(Ord. 2007-11-06, passed 12-10-07) Penalty, see § 110.99



§ 110.31  RATE.



   (A)   The occupational license fee that is levied and imposed by
this subchapter is at the rate of:



      (1)   Employees. One percent (1%) of all of the gross
compensation earned by an employee for labor, work or services provided in
the city.



      (2)   Those not an employee. Three-fourths of one percent
(0.75%) of the net profits of everybody, other than an employee, who is
engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business in
the city; but no less than fifty dollars ($50.00); provided, however, that
the Mayor or City Administrative Officer may waive the fifty dollar ($50.00)
minimum in the event of either:



         (a)   The total gross receipts from activities in the
city during the tax period are less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00);
and



         (b)   Within thirty (30) days after the close of the tax
year of the taxpayer, the city receives a written request for a refund of the
balance of the fifty dollar ($50.00) minimum that has been paid after
deducting the tax that is due based on a rate of three-fourths of one percent
(0.75%) of the net profits generated in the city.



   (B)   There is hereby reserved to the Mayor or the City
Administrative Officer the right to deny any request for a waiver of the
fifty dollar ($50.00) minimum that is incomplete or fails to follow the
process for that waiver described in this section.



(Ord. 2007-11-06, passed 12-10-07)



§ 110.32  APPORTIONMENT OF NET PROFITS.



   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby determined
that the apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly represent the
extent of the engagement in the city of those, other than an employee, who
are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business
both within and outside of the city; and, accordingly, the following
described property factor is hereby added to the payroll factor and the sales
factor provided in KRS 67.753 for the apportionment of the net profits of
those, other than an employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business both within and outside of the city.



   (A)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is
the average value of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property
owned or rented and used in the city during the computation period, and the
denominator of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer’s real and
tangible personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during the
computation period. In the determination of the property factor:



      (1)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original
cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net
annual rental rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less
any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub- rentals.



      (2)   The average value of property shall be determined by
averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the computation period,
but the City Administrative Officer may require the averaging of monthly
values during the computation period if reasonably required to reflect
properly the average value of the taxpayer’s property.



   (B)   The proportion of the total net profits everywhere of those,
other than an employee, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other business both within and outside of the city that are
subject to the occupational license fee established by this subchapter, shall
be determined by multiplying the total net profits thereof everywhere by the
quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales factor described in
KRS 67.753(2) and (3), and the property factor described in division (A)
above, that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business
had in the city during the tax period, divided by the total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business
had in the city during the tax period. The total number of those factors that
the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the
city during the tax period will always be either one (1), two (2) or three
(3). For example, if the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business:



      (1)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city, during
the tax period, without either the property factor or the payroll factor in
the city, the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business had in the city during the tax
period would be one (1);



      (2)   Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll factor
in the city, during the tax period, without the property tax factor in the
city, the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business had in the city during the tax
period would be two (2); or



      (3)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll factor,
and the property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total number
of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period would be three (3).

that will be imposed for each separate offense and violation of this chapter
if the person who has committed the violation and offense does not contest a
citation therefor, is hereby established as one hundred dollars ($100.00); and

issuing a civil citation, give notice that the violation of this chapter
shall be remedied within a specified period of time.

534.050(2)(a) or a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum period of

A. Setback lines shall be required for the protection of existing and proposed streets and highways, as required for the zone in which the use is located;
B. That all buildings or structures in a designated floodway or floodplain or which tend to increase flood heights or obstruct the flow of flood waters shall be in accordance with this ordinance; and
C. All dwellings to be constructed or provided as part of land used for agricultural purposes shall meet all requirements of the zone in which said use is located and all other requirements of this ordinance.
SECTION 9.27 PHASED ZONING REGULATIONS
A. Phased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases where the timing and/or phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to the implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan. The intent of the phased zoning regulations is to encourage redevelopment of a specified area for the use and/or density designated within the comprehensive plan when the necessary conditions for such development are realized (e.g., demolition of existing building). Implicit in such a phased zoning approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized, the type of development designated within the comprehensive plan is premature; such development would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the predominant existing land use, with a clear stipulation of an intended future rezoning, which would be in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan.
B. The phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning classification by means of a zone change process. The use of the phased zoning regulations
Article IX General Requirements 9-47
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid zone are currently being enforced, based upon the general existing land use, but upon attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the adopted comprehensive plan for the type of use and/or density, the area could be rezoned in direct compliance with the plan.
C. Phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the overlaid zone, the letter "P", as a suffix enclosed in parentheses. For example, in order to properly phase its change, an area zoned R-1C, which is identified for future use on the adopted comprehensive plan for "industrial" could be temporarily zoned R-1C (P), indicating that present development on the site would be in conformance with the regulations of the overlaid R-1C Zone, but that, upon the attainment of certain conditions (e.g., provision of an adequate access road, demolition of existing buildings), the area could be rezoned through a zone change procedure to an industrial zone. At the time of the zone change, the temporary R-1C (P) Zone is removed and the area is developed according to the regulations of the new zone, which is in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan.
SECTION 9.28 CITY GOVERNMENTAL USES: All City of Edgewood governmental or public service uses shall be a principal permitted use in all residential zones, providing they are located adjacent to an arterial street as designated in the locally adopted comprehensive plan and developed in accordance with the area and height regulations for conditionally permitted uses as provided for in the respective residential zones. In the event said governmental or public service uses are not located adjacent to an arterial street, as designated in the adopted comprehensive plan, then said uses shall be treated as conditional uses, as provided in this ordinance.
SECTION 9.29 FILING OF CERTIFICATE OF LAND USE RESTRICTIONS
A. FILING OF CERTIFICATES OF LAND USE RESTRICTIONS: A "Certificate of Land Use Restriction" shall be filed in the office of the county clerk by the planning commission, legislative body, and/or board of adjustments, whichever body(s) impose(s) any land use restrictions according to the provisions of KRS 100.3681 to 100.3684. A $10.50 fee for recording such filing shall be collected by the body imposing the restriction. This fee shall be paid over to the county clerk. An additional fee, not to exceed $10.50, may be imposed by the body imposing the restriction for costs of completing and filing the certificate.
SECTION 9.30 REGULATIONS CONCERNING TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS
A. TELEVISION: Earth stations for the reception and/or transmittal of TV signals, programs, messages, etc., may be installed as accessory structures in any zone, in compliance with the following regulations:
Article IX General Requirements 9-48

1. Such structures, including support equipment, shall not be permitted within any front yard or side yard (on each side of the lot) in any zone. Such structures may be permitted to extend into the minimum rear yard depth, as defined herein, in all zones, provided that such structures are set back from the rear lot line a minimum of ten (10) feet, and side yard clearances are maintained.
2. Structures may be ground mounted or roof mounted, provided that maximum height limitations are maintained. If the structure is roof mounted, it shall be located in a manner so as to detract as little as possible from the architectural character of the building.
3. Structures shall be constructed to withstand a wind load of eighty (80) miles per hour.
4. Structures shall be grounded electrically and shall not cause to disturb, restrict, or impede the reception of equipment on adjoining properties.
B. RADIO: Earth stations for the reception and/or transmittal of radio signals, programs, messages, etc., may be installed as accessory structures in any zone, in compliance with the following regulations:
1. Such structures, including tower, mast, antenna, guy wires, support equipment, etc., shall not be permitted within any front yard or side yard (on each side of the lot) in any zone. Such structures may be permitted to extend into the minimum rear yard depth, as defined herein, in all zones, provided that such structures are set back from the rear lot line a minimum of ten (10) feet, and side yard clearances are maintained.
2. Such structures, including tower, mast, antenna, guy wires, support equipment, etc., shall not exceed seventy (70) feet in height, as measured from ground level to the highest point of the structure.
3. Structures shall be constructed to withstand a wind load of eighty (80) miles per hour.
4. Structures shall be grounded electrically and shall not cause to disturb, restrict, or impede the reception of equipment on adjoining properties.
SECTION 9.31 REGULATIONS CONCERNING UTILITIES

SECTION 9.32 COMPATABILITY STANDARDS FOR QUALIFIED MANUFACTURED HOUSING
A. PURPOSE: The purpose of compatibility standards for manufactured housing is:
1. To permit local governments to adopt and enforce, as part of its zoning regulations, compatibility standards governing the placement of qualified manufactured homes in residential zones, within the local government’s jurisdiction, designed to ensure that when a qualified manufactured home is placed in a residential zone, it is compatible, in terms of assessed value, with existing housing located immediately adjacent to (1) either side of the proposed site within the same block front; (2) adjacent to the rear, or (3) within a one-eighth (1/8) mile radius or less from the proposed location of the qualified manufactured home.
B. A qualified manufactured home that meets the compatibility standards as set forth in Subsections D. 5., and D. 6., of this section, as well as the regulations of the zone in which it is proposed, shall be allowed as a permitted use and as a primary family residence in any residential zone permitting detached single-family residential uses.
C. Applications must be submitted to the zoning administrator demonstrating that the compatibility standards as set forth in Subsections D., 5. and D. 6., have been met and contending that the proposed construction, installation, or relocation of the qualified manufactured home is similar and comparable in exterior appearance, building materials, and living area to other dwelling units that have been constructed on adjacent tracts, lots, and parcels.
D. The procedures for approval shall be in accordance with the requirements of Article XVI and the following:
1. Applications for the placement of qualified manufactured homes shall be submitted with a nonrefundable application fee on a form or forms developed for that purpose to the city zoning administrator. Qualified manufactured homes may not be constructed until after an application has been accepted and approved in accordance with these regulations.
2. The application shall include (1) only information reasonably necessary to make determination as to conformity with the provisions of this Section of this ordinance; (2) recent photographs of the front, side and rear of the qualified manufactured home exterior finish (whichever is applicable); (3) pictures taken from the proposed site of the dwelling unit in the northerly, easterly, southerly, and westerly directions, and pictures of any adjacent dwelling units. The photographs shall be taken within 30 days prior to the submittal of the application. In addition, each application shall be
Article IX General Requirements 9-50
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
accompanied by a site plan or plot plan containing appropriate information including, but not limited to, the following:
a. Location of all existing buildings, structures, easements, and boundary lines;
b. North arrow, scale, city and land lot;
c. Existing use of adjacent property;
d. Location of all proposed buildings, structures, and land uses.
3. Applications shall be first reviewed for completeness. If the application is rejected for not being complete, the applicant shall be notified of the reasons for the rejection. The applicant shall be responsible for the satisfaction of all of the comments prior to the resubmission of the revised application.
4. The application shall be reviewed for compatibility with architectural appearance and similarity with:
a. adjacent development or surrounding developments;
b. development within the same zone or general area;
c. proposed development permitted in the same zone or general area; and,
5. Compatibility with architectural appearance shall be based on the following:
a. floor living space and setbacks;
b. siding and exterior materials;
c. roof pitch;
d. square footage;
e. general aesthetic appearance.
6. Compatibility with the orientation and location of existing structures shall be based on the following:
a. building height;
b. building width;
c. building depth;
d. building setbacks.
7. A decision of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of a complete application shall be made and the applicant shall be notified in writing. Conditional approval shall require that the specific conditions and the reasons therefore be stated in writing and be agreed to by the applicant; such conditions shall be binding upon the applicant upon agreement. In
Article IX General Requirements 9-51
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
the case of disapproval, the reasons therefore shall be specifically stated in writing by designating each specific provision of this section or other applicable ordinance that is not met and an explanation as to the reason or reasons why each such provision is not met.
SECTION 9.33 REGULATIONS OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
A. The city of Edgewood, together with the other cities in Kenton County together with the Kenton County Fiscal Court, after consultation among the mayors, councils, commissioners and staffs of the municipalities and the county within the County, found that a substantial need exists to revise significantly the ordinances regarding sexually oriented businesses within Kenton County.
B. The city of Edgewood, in association with Planning and Development Services of Kenton County and the Fiscal Court of adjacent Campbell County its cities in the Northern Kentucky Community, retained Duncan Associates to conduct a study of existing sexually oriented uses and related businesses in Kenton and Campbell Counties, which is part of a single, larger community.
C. Duncan Associates assigned two nationally-known planners, Eric Damian Kelly, FAICP and Connie B. Cooper, FAICP, to conduct that study
D. Kelly and Cooper have completed that study, including the following elements:
1. Field study, involving visits to all identified existing sexually oriented businesses in Kenton and Campbell Counties;
2. Meetings with stakeholder groups involved in these businesses;
3. Consultation with the Kenton County, Campbell County Attorney, and the city attorneys for certain cities, and the community at large on this issue;
4. Consultation with the professional staff of Planning and Development Services of Kenton County on this issue;
5. Review of studies and litigation concerning sexually oriented businesses in other communities;
6. Investigation of regulatory approaches to massage therapy;
7. Review of existing ordinances in Kenton and Campbell Counties;
8. Review of similar ordinances in a number of communities outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky;
9. Review of Kentucky statutes related to regulating sexually oriented businesses.
E. Duncan Associates has summarized this work and presented recommendations to Planning and Development Services of Kenton County and Kenton and Campbell Counties and their cities in an August 2003 report entitled “Site Visit Analysis: Sexually Oriented and Related Businesses in Kenton and Campbell Counties” (hereinafter called simply the “Kelly and Cooper Study”).
Article IX General Requirements 9-52
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
F. That study has also been made available to the legislative bodies of Kenton and Campbell Counties for their consideration and use.
G. That study has been accepted and used by the Fiscal Court of Kenton County in adopting the countywide licensing ordinance, Kenton County Ordinance No. 451.9, as amended, establishing licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus in 2004.
H. The United States Supreme Court in City of Renton v. Playtime Theater, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that local governments may rely upon the experiences of other cities as well as on its own studies in enacting local legislation to regulate sexually oriented businesses;
I. The United States Supreme Court in Renton and other cases has held that a local government may regulate such uses through content-neutral, time, place, and manner restrictions, so long as said regulations are designed to serve the government interest and do not unreasonably omit avenues of communication, and are aimed not at the content of protected speech within said establishments but rather at the secondary effects of said establishments on the surrounding communities.
J. The study by Kelly and Cooper found extensive physical interaction between patrons and dancers at many of the establishments in both Kenton and Campbell Counties.
K. Covington, the only municipality in Kenton County that has had sexually oriented businesses within its border, from January 1, 2002, to February 11, 2004, the police made a total of 469 calls to sexually oriented businesses in the city. The crimes committed at these establishments during this time period included robbery, assault, fraud, malicious mischief, public intoxication, and possession of illegal drugs. In addition, on June 13, 2003, Covington police arrested three individuals for prostitution-related charges at Liberty's Show Lounge, a sexually oriented cabaret in the city.
L. As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a decision addressing issues related to the Adult Entertainment ordinance in the City of Newport (Campbell County), there is a long history underlying efforts to regulate sex businesses in Northern Kentucky:
Defendant City of Newport ("City" or "Newport") long ago gained a reputation as home to a veritable smorgasbord of vice, attracting patrons from across the nation. For decades, the small city was considered the Midwest's answer to Las Vegas, and leaders of organized crime were said to operate its gambling casinos and nightclubs.
Article IX General Requirements 9-53
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
In the 1960's, public pressure began to demand that Newport be cleaned up. This pressure has continued until the present, with varying degrees of success.
A 1986 report generated by the Newport Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator indicated that of 28 adult bars opened since 1978 (including successive bars at the same site), 21 had had at least one prostitution-related conviction, and 18 had had multiple convictions. Def. Ex. K, p. 2. The report explained that "all of the prostitution in businesses with adult entertainment involved an alcoholic beverage as the median [sic] of exchange and the solicitation of such drinks by 'mixers.'" Id. In all, 98% of prostitution arrests in Newport occurred in the vicinity of these bars. Id. Adult entertainment establishments, which constituted 12% of all businesses serving alcohol, accounted for 17% of all police runs. Def. Ex. K, p. 21.
A later review, conducted in 1990 by the Newport License Inspector, documented the continued prostitution arrests occurring at several adult dancing establishments. Def. Ex. G. Moreover, the City determined that over $ 70,000 was expended in 1990 to target, patrol and prosecute the illicit behavior occurring in and around the bars. Def. Ex. H.
Several of Newport's citizens, merchants and church groups also opposed the presence of the semi-nude dancing clubs. These groups generally believed that the adult entertainment clubs were "clouds over [the] neighborhood that keep [it] from growing in the [right] direction." See Def. Ex. I (letter to Mayor from Taylors Landing Business District). Complaints commonly expressed were that the seamy establishments deterred other merchants from locating in Newport's business district, deterred shoppers, served a poor example for the City's youth, and generally tarnished the City's image. Id.
Bright Lights, Inc., v. City of Newport, 830 F. Supp. 378, 380-81 (E. D. Ky. 1993).
Based on those findings, the court went on to hold in relevant part:
Having considered the matter carefully, the court concludes that some leeway must be afforded the reform efforts of the City Council of Newport. This body has been elected by the citizens to attempt to "clean up the image" of the City.
To do this, it must overcome the sleazy impression of Newport and Northern Kentucky that survives from "the heyday" when things ran wide open; reform candidates were literally drugged and framed for morals offenses by public officials and police officers; the members of reform citizens groups were vilified and harassed; and a "liberal" in local parlance was a person favoring the continued open and notorious violation of the gambling and morals laws.
Article IX General Requirements 9-54
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
To illustrate that the Council's perception of a need to clean up the image of the City is not paranoid, the court notes the following statements in a national magazine's satirical Chapter on Newport's big sister, the city of Cincinnati.
"The city's streets fairly shine; the odd litterer draws a scornful stare. Wide avenues, bosky side streets, the most inviting of thoroughfares. And clean. So clean. No X-rated movie theaters, no adult-book stores, no bare-breasted night joints soil these streets, all of them long ago jettisoned over to the Kentucky side of the river."
Peter Richmond, “Town Without Pity,” Gentlemen's Quarterly, July 1993, at 102, 104.
This court holds that the City of Newport has the right to secede as Cincinnati's combat zone.
The court holds that the City has "an important and substantial governmental interest" in advancing these reform goals, which interest is furthered by the ordinances in question. Barnes, 111 S. Ct. at 2461. The court further finds and holds that in the case of the City of Newport, given its unique history, the ordinances' "incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest." Id. (quoting O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 376-77, 88 S. Ct. at 1678-79).
Newport's image affects that of all of Northern Kentucky, a community of nearly 300,000 people. That City and its community have the right to project a progressive and decent image. The nudity ordinances contribute to the enhancement of this interest and will be upheld. 830 F.Supp. at 384;
M. The Supreme Court had earlier noted in upholding another regulation in Newport, “it is plain that, as in Bellanca, the interest in maintaining order outweighs the interest in free expression by dancing nude.” Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U.S. 92, 97, 93 L. Ed. 2d 334, 340, 107 S. Ct. 383, 386 (1986). Although the significance of the opinion itself is now questionable (see J&B Social Club # 1 v. City of Mobile, 966 F. Supp. 1131, 1135 (S.D. Ala. 1996)), the quoted part of the opinion stands unchallenged.
N. The cities of Covington and Newport continue their efforts to improve their image. Since 1985, Covington has redeveloped its riverfront, creating several new office towers, high-end condominiums, hotels, and a convention center. In Newport, in conjunction with private development and Southbank Partners, Inc., the City has built a major entertainment center along the river. This initiative has promoted improved pedestrian and transit connections in Northern Kentucky’s river cities to and from the stadiums and other attractions along the Cincinnati riverfront.
Article IX General Requirements 9-55
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
O. Despite these efforts, the areas of downtown Covington and Newport away from the riverfront continue to suffer in many ways. The study by Kelly and Cooper found in the area near to existing sexually oriented uses a number of building vacancies and building maintenance falling far short of that found in the revitalized areas near the river.
P. The city of Edgewood respects the Constitutional rights of its citizens, including the right to present certain types of entertainment that may not appeal to the entire population. Through this ordinance, it is the desire of the city of Edgewood to balance the Constitutional rights of businesses that present sexually oriented entertainment with the city of Edgewood interests in ensuring that this community not suffer from the same sorts of adverse effects that Covington and Newport have long suffered.
Q. From long experience in Covington and Newport, as well as from the following studies and others not listed, the city of Edgewood also finds that such businesses may have primary and secondary effects involving crimes related to the activities in the establishments, of which prostitution and crimes of violence are those of greatest concern. See for example:
1. “Final Report to the City of Garden Grove: The Relationship between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden Grove Boulevard,” Richard W. McCleary, Ph.D., James W. Meeker, J.D., Ph.D., October 23, 1991.
2. “Survey of Appraisers: Fort Worth and Dallas – Effects of Land Uses on Surrounding Property Values,” Duncan Associates, Eric Damian Kelly, FAICP, and Connie B. Cooper, FAICP, September 2004.
3. “Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis,” 1984.
4. “Adult Business Study,” by City of Phoenix Planning Department, May 25, 1979.
5. “Effects on Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Saint Paul,” June 1978, City of Saint Paul Division of Planning, Department of Planning and Management; and Community Crime Prevention Project, Minnesota Crime Control Planning Board.
6. “Staff Report, Whittier City Planning Commission; Subject: Adult Business Regulations,” July 11, 1994.
7. “Adult Entertainment Study,” Department of City Planning, City of New York, Second Printing, November 1994.
8. “Adult Use Study,” Newport News Department of Planning and Development, March 1996.

Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
Always Wanted to Know about Regulating Sex Businesses, Planning Advisory Service Report No. 495-96. Chicago: American Planning Association, 2000; pages 51-57.
11. The Tucson “study” consisting of two memos: one from the Citizens Advisory Planning Committee, addressed to the Mayor and City Council, and dated May 14, 1990; and the other from an Assistant Chief of Police to the City Prosecutor, regarding “Adult Entertainment Ordinance,” dated May 1, 1990.
R. The city of Edgewood recognizes that some of the cited studies included bars without sexually oriented entertainment among the businesses studied; the city of Edgewood finds, nevertheless, that addressing the establishments that have live, sexually oriented entertainment is a more critical local issue than that of bars without such entertainment, for three reasons:
1. Bars in Kentucky are already regulated by the Commonwealth, and those state regulations directly address many of the concerns that arise with the service of alcohol;
2. The local history of prostitution and sex-related crimes has largely been related to businesses with live, sexually oriented entertainment, and not with other establishments that serve alcohol; and
3. The interaction between dancers who are paid to work with very limited clothing and the customers who pay to see them work in the establishments with live entertainment creates a sexually charged environment and the opportunity to negotiate for the provision of additional services that do not involve dancing or other protected expression and that are simply unacceptable under the standards of the County and its citizens.
S. As noted earlier in these findings, there is a long local history of prostitution and sex-related crimes at or incident to the operation of establishments with live, sexually oriented entertainment. Further, the studies shown herein provide further evidence of the potential crime-related secondary effects from such businesses. Although the methodologies and quality of these studies vary somewhat, local experience has demonstrated to the city of Edgewood that the relationship between crime and such establishments is a fact in Northern Kentucky and not just a theory published in a study.
T. The city of Edgewood has reviewed evidence and testimony presented at public meetings before the County, and information based on the past experiences of the Kenton and Campbell Counties and the cities of Covington and Newport, the experiences of the County Attorneys’ offices prosecuting numerous and varied offenses that have occurred in and around the sexually oriented entertainment establishments, and based upon the documented experiences of other governmental units within Kentucky and elsewhere in dealing with the impact of
Article IX General Requirements 9-57
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
sexually oriented entertainment, that such businesses can, if not properly regulated, be deleterious to said community.
U. The city of Edgewood finds that the countywide licensing ordinance related to sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus adopted by the Fiscal Court of Kenton County is an effective tool for addressing the many operational issues that can arise with such businesses.
V. The city of Edgewood finds that amendments to the city’s Zoning Ordinance regarding the location and design of such businesses are important variables in the nature and extent of adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community, and further finds that location and design are among the types of issues that are typically addressed through zoning.
W. Based on the recommendations of Kelly and Cooper, which are based on their experience in other communities and their review of the studies cited above and other local efforts to address such secondary effects, the city of Edgewood finds that the following principles are essential to effective zoning controls of sexually oriented businesses:
1. Sexually oriented businesses should, to the maximum extent practicable, be separated from one another by a distance that is greater than a convenient walking distance, because experience elsewhere has shown that the location of such businesses near one another may increase the adverse secondary effects, particularly those related to crime, by a greater than arithmetic factor;
2. Sexually oriented businesses have the greatest adverse effect on residential neighbourhoods and should thus be separated to the maximum extent practicable from residential neighbourhoods;
3. Sexually oriented businesses are likely to attract criminal elements that prey on “soft targets,” including children, and it is thus important to separate sexually oriented businesses from schools, parks, recreation centers, and religious institutions, all of which are places where children are likely to congregate, often without parental protection;
4. Also because of the tendency of sexually oriented businesses to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets, it is important to seek locations for such businesses that are not located along pedestrian routes, where young people, old people and others who are vulnerable, are likely to walk in going about their day-to-day business. Thus, locations to which the primary access is by automobile minimize the risk of persons going about their daily business encountering persons who are visiting or even loitering around the sexually oriented businesss.
X. In examining Kenton County for available sites that would be suitable for sexually oriented businesses that meet the above criteria, Kelly and Cooper identified a
Article IX General Requirements 9-58
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
number of such sites in the County, none of which were located in city of
Edgewood.
Y. Edgewood currently has no sexually oriented businesses in the community.
Z. Edgewood currently has no area zoned for any type of commercial use.
AA. Edgewood currently has only limited areas zoned for commercial use, and those
areas are small and adjacent to residential areas.
AB. Edgewood has within its limited commercial areas only small, local businesses
generally serving the convenience needs of residents.
AC. Edgewood residents in these jurisdiction with limited commercial areas must go
to larger, nearby cities for most of their retail purchases and entertainment.
AD. Staff of Edgewood can not recall ever receiving any applications for or inquiries
about the establishment of any sexually oriented business in the city of
Edgewood.
AE. Edgewood thus finds that the physical context and experience of the City of
Edgewood support the findings by Kelly and Cooper.
AF. Edgewood finds that, in reliance on the Kelly and Cooper study, other
municipalities in the County, including specifically Covington, Erlanger and Taylor
Mill, all of which have large and diverse commercial or industrial areas with
suitable sites that would be potentially available locations where sexually
oriented businesses could legally locate.
AG. Edgewood acknowledges that it can re-evaluate these findings if, in the future,
there is a substantial change in the character of the community and the potential
for suitable sites for sexually oriented businesses within the community.
AH. Edgewood therefore finds that there are no suitable locations for sexually
oriented businesses in the city of Edgewood and such businesses should
therefore be prohibited.
AI. FINDINGS: The facts and other matters set forth in the previous clauses that
form the preamble to this ordinance are hereby adopted as findings of fact in
support of the legislative action of the city of Edgewood in adopting this
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance. Upon adoption of this zoning amendment,
these shall be incorporated into the Zoning Code by reference as if fully set forth
therein to the adopting Resolution.

SECTION 9.34 FLOOD PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised Statutes 151.230 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the legislative body of the City of Edgewood, Kentucky, hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows:
2. FINDINGS OF FACT
a. The flood hazard areas of the City of Edgewood are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
b. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Article IX General Requirements 9-69
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
d. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas.
4. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this ordinance are to:
a. Protect human life and health;
b. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
c. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
d. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
e. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
f. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
g. Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area; and,
h. Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume responsibility for their actions.

2. SPECIFIC STANDARDS
In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Section 9.34.C.2, the following provisions are required:
a. Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than 2 feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate
Article IX General Requirements 9-95
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 9.34.E.2.c.
(1) In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(2) In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than 2 feet above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
(3) In all other Zones, elevated 2 feet above the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be properly

(5) All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an elevation 2 feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the standards of Section 9.34.E.2.c.
c. Elevated Structures. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(1) Openings for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
Article IX General Requirements 9-97
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
(i) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
(2) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
(3) The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms.
d. Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
(1) All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
i) On individual lots or parcels,
ii) In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
iii) In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or
iv) In substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
v) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, and

All such manufactured homes must be:
(i) Elevated on a permanent foundation, and
(ii) Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than 2 feet above the level of the base flood elevation, and
(iii) Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
Article IX General Requirements 9-98
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
(2) Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
(i) The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
o The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than 2 feet above the base flood elevation, or

(iii) Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this ordinance, including anchoring and elevation requirements for “manufactured homes”.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
e. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 9.34.C.2, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base
Article IX General Requirements 9-99
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; (2) If Section 9.34.E.2.e is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 9.34.E.
3. STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR FLOODWAYS
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Section 9.34.C.2, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
a. No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
b. New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with Section 9.34.C.2.
4. STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Section 9.34.E.C.2, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1 – 3’), where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
Article IX General Requirements 9-100
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
b. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in Section 9.34.E.2.b.
5. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS
a. All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,
d. In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
e. All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Article IX General Requirements 9-101
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
6. STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER ‘A’
For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated ‘A’ the following provisions shall apply:

e. Must elevate utilities 2 feet above the base flood elevation;
f. Can only be used for storage or parking; and
g. Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
7. CRITICAL FACILITIES
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
F. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
1. Nature Of Variances
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
Article IX General Requirements 9-102
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
It is the duty of the legislative body to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
2. Designation of Variance and Appeal Board
a. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of these regulations.
3. Duties of Board of Adjustment
a. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
b. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.
4. Variance Procedures
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and the:
a. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
d. Importance to the community of the services provided by the existing or proposed facility;
e. Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally dependent use;
f. Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
Article IX General Requirements 9-103
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
g. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
i. Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
k. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and culverts.
5. Conditions for Variances
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
a. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
b. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the legislative body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the legislative body believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(i) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition section under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Article IX General Requirements 9-104
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
d. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
e. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request
f. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Article 6 (4) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
6. Variance Notification
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
b. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Kenton County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
c. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
7. Historic Structures
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Article IX General Requirements 9-105
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
G. SEVERABILITY
This ordinance and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
If any clause, sentence, or phrase of the Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
This ordinance was adopted at a public meeting of the legislative body of the City of Edgewood on March 4, 2013.

(2) Yards and parking areas should be designed to follow natural contours, drainage patterns, and vegetation.
(3) The natural slope line of the hill, as seen in profile, should be retained.
(4) Existing native vegetation should be preserved, and when disturbed, should be supplemented with new native vegetation.
(5) Trees should be planted in random clusters, not in rows, to compliment the natural pattern of tree distribution.
(6) All cuts, fills, and other earth modifications should be replanted with appropriate native vegetation.
Article IX General Requirements 9-114
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance July 2019 PDS
(7) The risk of off-site geologic property damage should be minimized by locating development away from areas vulnerable to sliding.
(8) Grading for buildings, driveways, outdoor use areas, utilities, etc., should be minimized to preserve a site’s natural topography.
(9) When grading operations are necessary, the smallest practical areas of land should be exposed at any one time and the length of exposure should be kept to the shortest practicable amount of time.
E. RIPARIAN PROTECTION
1. Purpose: It is the intent of this sub-section to establish riparian buffer areas adjacent to all perennial streams and rivers in Kenton County to: protect public and private water supplies; trap sediment and other pollutants in surface runoff; promote bank stabilization; protect riparian wetlands; minimize the impacts of flooding; prevent decreases in base flow; protect wildlife habitat; and maintain water quality.
2. DEFINITIONS: Notwithstanding other definitions within this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply only to this sub-section:

SECTION 10.8 PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT) OVERLAY ZONE
A. PURPOSE: The purposes of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay Zone are to: promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification in the relationships between location of and types of uses and structures; promote the advantages of modern large scale site planning for community development through the efficient use of land, facilitating a more economic arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities; preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features and amenities, and to utilize such features in an harmonious fashion; provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities, other public and common facilities, than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures, but always with the intention of furthering the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. GENERAL: A Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay Zone may only be permitted to be superimposed over any of the Residential Zones, provided that all conditions or provisions of this section of the ordinance, the applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations, and any additional requirements, as may be determined necessary to provide for the most efficient layout of the PUD and its proper integration with the surrounding development, are met; and a public hearing is held on the PUD application.
C. APPLICATION AND PROCESSING: Applications for a Planned Unit Development Overlay Zone shall be processed as follows in two stages:
1. Stage I -- Development Plan and Zoning Map Amendment - Application for amendment to PUD Overlay Zone shall include a development plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.20, A., Stage I Plan Requirements.
a. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed application in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter 424, and review said application with regard to its compliance with the stated purposes of the PUD Overlay Zone, the required elements of the Stage I Plan, and other applicable requirements of this section. Upon holding such hearing, the planning commission shall make one of the following recommendations to the legislative body: approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval. The planning commission shall submit, along with their recommendations, a copy of the Stage I Plan and the bases for their recommendation.

Article X Zones 10-23
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance April 2017 PDS
recommendations and take action to approve or disapprove said PUD application. Such action may incorporate any conditions imposed by the planning commission. However, should the legislative body take action to impose different conditions than were reviewed and considered by the planning commission, then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the planning commission for further review and recommendation in accordance with Subsection C., 1., a., above. Approval of the PUD Overlay Zone shall require that development be in conformance with the Stage I approved plan.
The legislative body shall forward a copy of the approved plan to the planning commission for further processing in accordance with the requirement for Stage II plan and record plat
Zoning Map Amendment - Upon approval of the PUD Overlay Zone, the official zoning map shall be amended by adding the prefix "PUD" to the existing residential zone (e.g., PUD-R-1B, PUD-R-1C, etc.) for the area as shown on the Stage I approved plan.
2. Stage II - Plan and Record Plat - A Stage II Plan and Record Plat shall be developed in conformance with the Stage I approved plan and in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.20, B. and C., and submitted to the planning commission for its review and approval.

SECTION 11.3 ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS
In order to promote greater safety of passage between highway and land, improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the highway, permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel, and increase and protect the capacity of the highway, the location and design of access points shall be in accordance with the following access control requirements. These requirements shall apply to all arterial and collector type streets, as identified in the adopted comprehensive plan.
A. PROVISION OF RESERVED TURNING LANES: At those access points where vehicles turning to and from the arterial and collector streets will affect the roadway capacity, reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the developer.
B. PROVISION OF FRONTAGE ROAD: Where possible, provision for the construction of a frontage road shall be made. However, access to the arterial or collector streets via an intersecting street or a common driveway shall be investigated if such a design is not reasonable.
C. COORDINATION OF ACCESS POINTS: Major Access points on opposite sides of the arterial and collector streets shall be located opposite each other, otherwise turning movement restrictions may be imposed by the planning commission or zoning administrator, whichever is applicable. In addition, in order to maximize the efficient utilization of access points, access drives shall be designed, located, and constructed in a manner to provide and make possible the coordination of access with, and between, adjacent properties developed (present or future) for similar uses. As a condition of approval for construction, use, or reuse of any access road, the zoning administrator may require that unobstructed and unencumbered access, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, be provided from any such access point to adjacent properties.
D. SPACING RESTRICTIONS FOR SIGNALIZED ACCESS POINTS: Access points which will warrant signalization shall be spaced a minimum distance of one quarter (1/4) mile apart. The exact location of the signal light shall be determined by a traffic engineering study which shall at least account for the following variables:
1. Speed
2. Traffic signal phasing
3. Traffic signal cycle length
4. Roadway geometrics
5. Accident experience
Provision for all turning movements to maintain the design capacity of the roadway shall be required.
Article XI Off-Street Parking And Access Control Regulations 11-14
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance February 2009 PDS
E. SIGHT DISTANCE: The location of access points shall comply with safe sight distance requirements, as provided in Table 1. The centerline of all access points shall intersect as nearly at a ninety (90) degree angle as possible, but in no case shall the angle of intersection be less than seventy-five (75) degrees or greater than one hundred five (105) degrees, unless approved by the planning commission or zoning administrator, whichever is applicable, due to certain exceptional conditions.
F. LOCATION OF UNSIGNALIZED ACCESS POINTS
1. Arterial Streets
a. Unsignalized access points shall be spaced a minimum distance of six hundred (600) feet apart. Turning restrictions and/or reserved lanes may be required.
b. One (1) access point per existing tract will be permitted. However, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point onto an arterial street (as provided in F., 1., a., above) cannot be met, then an access point may be located on a frontage road, or on an intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing requirements. In order for the intersecting local street or frontage road to function properly, access onto them should be controlled as follows:
(1) Access points onto local streets intersecting an arterial street shall be spaced a minimum distance of one hundred (100) feet, measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, from the arterial street.
(2) In areas zoned to permit commercial, industrial, or multi-family residential uses, access points from adjacent properties onto frontage roads, shall be no less than one hundred (100) feet, measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, from intersections of the frontage road with local or collector streets.
c. Where the frontage of a tract is greater than five hundred (500) feet an additional access point may be permitted. However, the type of access will depend on the spacing requirements in F., 1., a.
(1) If the frontage of the tract is large enough, then at least one (1) of the access points may have direct access onto the arterial street, provided the spacing between the adjacent access points meet the requirements of Section F., 1., a.,
Article XI Off-Street Parking And Access Control Regulations 11-15
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance February 2009 PDS
and all other requirements of this section of the ordinance. In the case where the frontage allows only one (1) point of direct access, due to spacing restrictions as provided herein, the second access point will be via a frontage road, or an intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing restrictions, as provided along the arterial street.
d. If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the requirements of this section of the ordinance, one (1) access point shall be provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements, or caused to be relocated by the zoning administrator at such time as the particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is otherwise provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road, or an intersecting local street, or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other improvements, may be required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases where said access points are classified as temporary, such designation shall be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the property in question.
2. Collector Streets
a. On two-lane roadways, one (1) access point per existing tract will be allowed. However, if the frontage is at least two hundred (200) feet, an additional access point may be permitted. Furthermore, the minimum spacing between adjacent access points on this type of facility shall be one hundred (100) feet, measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, except in the case where the street intersects another collector street or arterial street, then said access points shall be spaced a minimum of three hundred (300) feet from the intersection.
b. On multi-lane roadways, the spacing is dependent on whether or not a barrier median exists (prohibiting left-turn movements). If a barrier median exists, access points may be spaced as close as three hundred (300) feet. However, certain turning movements will be prohibited. If a barrier median does not exist, then the minimum
Article XI Off-Street Parking And Access Control Regulations 11-16
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance February 2009 PDS
spacing of access points shall be six hundred (600) feet. In addition, some turning movements may be prohibited.
c. One (1) access point per existing tract will be allowed; however, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point, as provided in F., 2., a., cannot be met, then an access point may be located on a frontage road, or on an intersecting street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing requirements.
d. If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the requirements of this section of the ordinance, one (1) access point shall be provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements, or caused to be relocated by the zoning administrator at such time as the particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is otherwise provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road, or an intersecting local street, or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other improvements, may be required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases where said access points are classified as temporary, such designation shall be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the property in question.
G. WIDTH OF ACCESS POINTS
1. In single-family residential zones, no access point width shall be less than nine (9) feet nor more than twenty (20) feet. In all other zones, access points shall not be less than twelve (12) feet nor more than forty-eight (48) feet in width. The width shall be as measured from the point of curb return to point of curb return, or edge of pavement if no curb exists, excluding the curb radius.
2. The zoning administrator may modify (enlarge or reduce) the width to provide for a more efficient and safe channelization and/or flow of traffic.
H. EXCEPTIONS TO ACCESS POINT REQUIREMENTS: Where situations develop that may require special treatment, the requirements as provided in Section 11.3, A. - G., may be varied by the city legislative body or zoning administrator upon presentation of evidence establishing that the special treatment will have no adverse effects on the roadway safety and capacity that justifies the variance.
Article XI Off-Street Parking And Access Control Regulations 11-17
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance February 2009 PDS
I. ACCESS POINT PROBLEM AREAS: If, after special study, it is determined that the type of use or activity proposed would have an adverse effect on the safety and capacity of the adjacent roadway, the access point spacing requirements, as contained in this section, may have to be increased in order to adequately solve the traffic movement.
J. APPROVAL OF ACCESS POINTS REQUIRED: Plans, at a scale not less than 1" = 100 fee, for all access points, and modifications thereto (including plans to use existing access points where a change of use for any tract of land would generate more traffic than the previous use, thus producing an adverse effect on the adjacent roadway), shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for approval or rejection. Such plans shall show the location of all access points, and access points within six hundred (600) feet in either direction. The proposed access point shall include typical cross-sections of pavement, the base and subbase, proposed grade, and storm drainage, and such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant. If such access points are being located in conjunction with off-street parking and/or loading and unloading facilities, then said plans shall also include parking and off-street loading and/or unloading plans, in accordance with Sections 11.0 and 12.0 of this ordinance.
K. APPROVAL OF ACCESS POINTS ALONG STATE MAINTAINED ROUTES BY KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION: A copy of the Plans for all access points to be constructed along a state maintained route shall also be submitted to the Kentucky Department of Transportation for review and approval during the same time as plans are submitted to the zoning administrator, as provided for in Section 11.2. No access point plans shall be approved, or permits issued, for construction by the zoning administrator, until said access point plans have been approved by the Kentucky Department of Transportation.

ARTICLE XII
OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING REGULATIONS
For all buildings and structures erected, altered, or extended, and all uses of land established as specified herein, after the effective date of this ordinance, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations herein. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the date of the adoption of this ordinance, and provided that construction has not begun within ninety
(90) days of such effective date, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities in the amounts required by this ordinance, shall prevail.
SECTION 12.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. SPACES REQUIRED
1. Every building, or part thereof, erected and occupied for uses permitted in commercial and industrial zones, including conditional uses permitted in residential zones, involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials, or merchandise, and having up to five thousand (5,000) square feet of gross floor area, shall be provided with at least one (1) loading and/or unloading space. A study shall be prepared by the company or operator to determine the additional loading and/or unloading space needs over and above the first space required for the specific use proposed. In determining the number of spaces needed, the study shall take into the consideration the following:
a. estimated and projected arrival and departure rates for scheduled and unscheduled (random) trucks
b. estimated and projected length of truck stop duration for loading and/or unloading of each truck
c. estimated number of trips by vehicle type (i.e., two axle vehicles, semi-tractor trailers, etc.) and size
The zoning administrator shall review the study of estimated and projected loading and/or unloading needs and make a determination if the number of spaces provided are adequate for the use proposed.
2. If it is determined by the zoning administrator, based on existing conditions of the proposed site, the design of the building, and the
Article XII Off-Street Loading And/Or Unloading Regulations 12-2
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
completed needs study, that additional loading and/or unloading spaces are needed to accommodate the facilities than could be reasonably provided, the zoning administrator shall require that additional parking areas, properly designed to handle the parking of necessary trucks, including the maneuvering of the trucks to and from the space, be provided for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded and/or unloaded.
3. If, after approval by the zoning administrator of the number of spaces and any storage of truck parking needed to accommodate the loading and/or unloading of trucks for a specific use, a need exists, based on operation of the specific use, to provide additional off-street loading and/or unloading spaces or storage of trucks than was previously determined, the zoning administrator may require that corrective action be taken to eliminate any deficiencies as follows:
a. limit the time and interval of arrival and departure of trucks, commensurate with the need
b. require necessary additional loading and/or unloading spaces, or require that adequate parking areas be provided for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded and/or unloaded
B. ADDITIONAL LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACES TO BE PROVIDED: Whenever the intensity of any use of a building, or premises is increased through addition of gross floor area, change of use, or increased activity, additional loading and/or unloading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 12.0, A., above, if it is determined by the zoning administrator that the existing spaces are not adequate to serve such increase in intensity.
C. LOCATION OF OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING AREA: All loading and/or unloading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use served. However, permitted uses located in industrial zones may provide parking areas for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded and/or unloaded within three hundred (300) feet from each lot served, upon the approval of the zoning administrator, provided that said off-street storage of trucks are unable to be provided on the same lot, or contiguous to the same lot, as the use being served and further provided that said storage of trucks is located in the same zone as the use being served. Loading and/or unloading areas may be located in the side and minimum required rear yards, provided that all loading and/or unloading facilities shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from the rear lot line and minimum side yard clearances are maintained.
Article XII Off-Street Loading And/Or Unloading Regulations 12-3
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS

Any other use of such space, including repair work or servicing of any kind, other than in an emergency, or the requirement of any payment for the use of such space, shall be in violation of the provisions of this ordinance.
F. NO BUILDING TO BE ERECTED IN OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE: No building of any kind shall be erected in any off-street loading and/or unloading space.
G. OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE SHALL NOT BE REDUCED: The required parking spaces, as set forth and designated in this ordinance, shall not be reduced, except as provided for in this ordinance.
H. LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED: Plans for all loading and/or unloading facilities shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for review and for compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and such other pertinent ordinances of the legislative body. Such plans shall show the number and location of loading and/or unloading spaces, including necessary maneuvering of trucks, and dock and apron approach, and arrangements of access aisles, location of access points onto adjacent streets, provisions for truck circulation, location of curbs on or adjacent to the property, utilities, location of signs, typical cross-sections of pavement, including base and subbase, proposed grade of lot, storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting facilities, and such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant. Where such loading and/or unloading plans include provisions for access points to adjacent streets, then said plans shall also be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 11.3.
SECTION 12.1 DESIGN AND LAYOUT OF OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING AREAS
A. SIZE OF OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE: Each off-street loading and/or unloading space shall be at least fourteen (14) feet in width and at least sixty (60) feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering spaces and shall have a vertical clearance of at least fifteen (15) feet, provided, however, that when it is demonstrated that a particular loading and/or unloading space will

Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
ARTICLE XIV
SIGN REGULATIONS
SECTION 14.1 SHORT TITLE: This Article shall be known as the Sign Article of the City of Edgewood.
SECTION 14.2 PURPOSE AND INTERESTS SERVED
A. The purpose of this Article is to establish a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of signs within the jurisdiction of the City of Edgewood. These regulations are designed to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare by controlling the type, number, location and physical dimensions of signs, to prevent the disruptions, obstructions and hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic that signs may cause, and to enhance the quality of the environment in residential and nonresidential districts.
As a basis for adopting these regulations, the City of Edgewood finds:
1. Signs are an essential form of communication in the built environment, providing way-finding guides to residents, visitors, public safety officials, customers and potential customers of local businesses, delivery people and others.
2. Signs also provide communication on public issues, as the U.S. Supreme Court found in City of LaDue v. Gilleo: Signs that react to a local happening or express a view on a controversial issue both reflect and animate change in the life of a community. Often placed on lawns or in windows, residential signs play an important part in political campaigns, during which they are displayed to signal the resident's support for particular candidates, parties, or causes. They may not afford the same opportunities for conveying complex ideas as do other media, but residential signs have long been an important and distinct medium of expression.
3. Retailers and other businesses depend on signs to help people find their businesses, and, in a large and expensive media market like that of Cincinnati (a market which includes Edgewood), many small businesses depend on signs as one of the most affordable forms of advertising.
4. Although signs thus serve many important purposes in society in general and in Edgewood in particular, there are other considerations that the City of Edgewood weighs heavily.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-2
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
5. Signs may distract drivers and lead to deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists as well as to drivers and passengers and to property damage. Moving, flashing and rapidly changing signs are particularly distracting to drivers. A proliferation of signs on a particular site can have the same effect as moving signs, as drivers try to sort through the visual cacophony to find the information that they want or need.
6. The Edgewood City Council, with the advice of the Kenton County Planning Commission and its professional staff, and with input from residents through the Direction 2030: Your Voice. Your Choice. planning process, has placed an increasing emphasis on preserving the sense of place and the design of the built environment; limiting the size, height and number of signs is an important tool in preserving a sense of place, a tool that accompanies the County’s standards for landscaping.
7. Direction 2030: Your Voice. Your Choice. recommends that policies, regulations and incentives be developed and implemented that preserve and improve the existing community fabric.
8. Balancing these competing considerations is particularly difficult in residential areas, where people value both their pleasing and visually appealing environments and their ability to communicate their opinions regarding candidates and public issues through yard signs.
9. In updating its ordinance in 2016 after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, the Edgewood City Council, working with PDS staff and an outside consultant, has made a major effort to limit content as a factor in its sign regulations. After due consideration, however, it has concluded that one way to leave room for extensive free expression through signs in residential areas while limiting total sign clutter is to maintain significant limits on commercial signs in residential areas. Recognizing the importance of “for sale” and “for lease” signs in maintaining the occupancy of healthy neighborhoods (see the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro), those signs must remain. There is a similar utility in providing for yard sale signs, which allow people to dispose of unwanted items without sending them to a landfill.
10. Although as the Court found in Reed v Gilbert, time limits on signs can be arbitrary, as the Court recognized in 2009 in Pleasant Grove v. City of Summum, a significant distinction between speakers expressing an opinion and signs is that “Speakers, however long-winded, will eventually come to the end of their remarks.” Members of the Edgewood City Council have long noted that signs for political campaigns as well as those advertising pancake breakfasts and spaghetti dinners for civic organizations are often abandoned after the events, contributing to clutter long after they have served their purpose. Although such signs were once typically paper or cardboard that would eventually decay, many today are plastic and will remain until removed. Thus, despite the expressed
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-3
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
concern of the Supreme Court with time limits, the Edgewood City Council finds that it has a substantial governmental interest in clarifying the status of signs for past events that thus no longer serve a purpose so that there is a legal basis for the City of Edgewood to remove them or force their removal.
11. The City of Edgewood has long allowed unlimited numbers of small signs bearing non-commercial messages to allow merchants and others to designate handicapped parking places, provide directions to ATMs and restrooms, warn of guard dogs and other hazards and provide a variety of other place-based information. With the prohibition of commercial messages on such signs, it has been the observation of the Edgewood City Council members and their professional staff members that property owners are judicious and appropriate in posting such signs. The City of Edgewood thus finds that it has a substantial interest in allowing merchants and property owners freely to post necessary informational signs but without allowing an endless proliferation of commercial messages.
12. Although in findings above the City of Edgewood has recognized the multiple values of signs in the built environment, Edgewood officials after consultation with the Planning Commission and representatives of cities and towns in the County concluded several years ago that there is no place for signs of overwhelming size and no relation to context in an urban and urbanizing environment like Edgewood. Although previous versions of these regulations followed the pattern of state and federal laws by defining such billboard as “off-site” signs, this ordinance addresses the same issue by establishing a form of circuit breaker size limit, prohibiting very large signs on small lots, on vacant lots, or on lots with only small buildings.
13. These are complex public policy issues, and the Edgewood City Council, with the help of its professional planners, attorneys and outside consultant, has attempted to balance the competing considerations in a way that it believes best protects the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Edgewood, including its many valued businesses and the thousands of visitors who arrive or pass through the City of Edgewood each month.

information and logos installed on drive-through canopies are also permitted and are not considered signs.

4. Pennants, banners, streamers, balloons, and similar devices;

(3) A sign on which the electronic or electro-mechanical message board includes less than 20 square feet of sign area shall not be erected within 100 feet of property zoned and used exclusively for single family uses; it is the express intent of this provision to allow the use of such technology on signs for institutional uses located in residential districts, provided that the required separation is maintained between the sign and any property zoned and exclusively used for a single-family use.

SECTION 14.13 MASTER SIGNAGE PLANS
A. PURPOSE AND INTENT
1. It is the purpose of the City of Edgewood to require owners, lessees and managers of sites containing multiple signs requiring permits to plan and design signs that are compatible with the buildings on the site, thus enhancing the appearance of the site and of the streetscape that includes it. This Section spells out specific criteria for review for compliance with the section, but the City of Edgewood recognizes that the consideration of issues of design necessarily requires some exercise of judgment, within the specific criteria set out in this Section. Although the City of Edgewood has provided a remedy of appeal for an applicant aggrieved by an action on a proposed master signage plan, it is the intent of the City of Edgewood that the primary remedy for such an applicant is the erection and installation of all of the signs allowed by right, under other sections of this Article. It is thus the intent of the City of Edgewood, that, to the extent that it can guide the scope of review of a court considering an appeal, a
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-28
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
court considering an appeal under this Section reverses or remands the decision of the Zoning Administrator only if it finds that such action is arbitrary and capricious.
B. APPLICABILITY
1. The owner of any site that includes more than one tenant or occupant shall apply for approval of a Master Signage Plan before applying for a sign permit for any detached sign.
C. PROCEDURE
1. The submittal of a Master Signage Plan shall be considered a Stage II Development Plan.
2. The owner(s) shall apply to the planning commission’s duly authorized representative.
3. Where an application for approval of a Master Signage Plan is submitted simultaneously or as part of another Stage II Development Plan, the two shall be processed together. Where an application includes properties not under common ownership, all property owners shall sign the application or shall submit documents granting the applicant the authority to process such an application.
4. The planning commission’s duly authorized representative shall review the submitted Stage II Development Plan with regard to its compliance with the required elements of this Section, for Master Signage Plans, other applicable elements of this Article, and other applicable regulations, and its conformity with any approved Stage I Development Plan for the property. In approving the Master Signage Plan, the planning commission’s duly authorized representative may authorize minor adjustments from the Stage I Development Plan.
5. If a Master Signage Plan application is denied, the applicant may submit a new application with a revised plan at any time.
6. Any person aggrieved by the action of the planning commission’s duly authorized representative on a Master Signage Plan may appeal the decision by filing an application with the Planning Commission.
D. APPLICATION CONTENTS
1. The application for approval of a Master Signage Plan shall contain at least the following information. Where the application is submitted simultaneously with an application for a Stage II Development Plan approval, the Master Signage Plan may refer to portions of the Stage II Development Plan application or approved Stage I Development Plan for related requirements:
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-29
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
a. If the site has not been improved, all information required by Section 9.20, B. for a Stage II Development Plan;

c. A proposed design plan showing signage design at a scale of ½” = 1 ft.
d. Computation of the maximum area for all signs, the height of signs and the number of detached signs allowed on the development site(s) included in the plan under this Article, including incentives authorized below;
e. For properties with multiple tenants or multiple occupants entitled to signs, an allocation of the allowed signage among the eligible tenants or users;
f. An accurate indication on the plot plan of the current or proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not, except that signs not requiring permits need not be shown;
g. The color schemes and design features (excluding specific messages) for proposed signs; and
h. The signatures of all owners or their authorized agents in such form as the legislative body may require.
E. AMENDMENTS
1. A Master Signage Plan may be amended by filing a new Master Signage Plan that conforms to all requirements of this Section in effect at the time of submittal.
F. PROVISIONS FOR NONCONFORMING SIGNS
1. A Master Signage Plan for a property already containing signs on the date of submission of the application shall include a schedule for bringing all signs on the development site into conformance with the Master Signage Plan by a specified date. The conformance schedule included in such Master Signage Plan shall be considered a condition of approval of the Master Signage Plan.
G. CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL
1. A Master Signage Plan shall be approved if and only if the planning commission’s duly authorized representative finds that the proposed plan meets all of the standards set out in this Article. If the planning commission’s duly authorized representative finds that the proposed plan substantially meets such standards, it may approve the proposed plan
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-30
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
subject to conditions that will cause it to meet these standards. Otherwise, the planning commission’s duly authorized representative shall deny the application for plan approval:

b. The total amount of signage proposed for any building, wall, site, or portion of a site, conforms with all applicable standards of this Article;
c. The proposed plan contains all of the information required by subsection D of this Section

(2) The materials and design of freestanding signs shall follow one design scheme, which may or may not be the same as the design scheme for wall signs;
(3) Each design scheme shall require consistency among signs for at least three of the following criteria: lighting design; color schemes; materials; shape; proportion; and/or type faces;
(4) If the design schemes for the wall signs and freestanding signs are different, they shall have in common at least two of the following criteria: lighting design; color schemes; materials; proportion; and
(5) The design scheme for freestanding signs shall use building materials, colors and, where applicable, architectural design features consistent with the materials, colors and architectural design features of the principal building on the site.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-31
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
H. EFFECT
1. After approval of a Master Signage Plan, no permit shall be issued for a sign on the site(s) subject to the Master Signage Plan except in accordance with such plan, and no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in accordance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this Article. In case of any conflict between a provision of a Master Signage Plan and one or more provisions of this Article, this Article shall prevail.
I. SPECIAL SEVERABILITY PROVISIONS
1. The severability provisions of Section 14.17. A., 11., are limited by this subsection. If any procedural aspect of this Section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, it is the intent of the City of Edgewood that this entire Section, but only this Section, should be stricken as unconstitutional, but that any plans previously approved under it should remain in effect, allowing the signs shown on such plans as lawful nonconforming signs, regardless of whether such signs have been erected on the date of such decision. If any substantive part of the standards and criteria for approval of this Section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional it is the intent of the City of Edgewood that such part be stricken and that the rest of this Section remain in full force and effect, in accordance with the principles set out in more detail in Section 14.17, A., 11.

SECTION 14.16 DEFINITIONS AND MEASUREMENTS
A. MEASUREMENTS
1. Area of Signs Other than Wall Signs
a. The gross surface area of a sign, except wall signs, is the entire area contained within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of such sign. For detached signs composed of more than one sign cabinet or module, the gross surface area shall include the sum of the area in each cabinet or module only. If a sign has more than one face, the gross surface area shall be equal to the maximum area of the sign face or faces visible from any ground position along any public right-of-way at any one time.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-36
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
b. The perimeter of a sign will not include lighting fixtures, pole covers, landscaping, framing, decorative roofing, moldings or aprons or other architectural or decorative embellishments, provided they contain no written copy, logos or symbols.
2. Area of Wall Signs
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-37
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
a. The gross surface area of a wall sign is the entire area contained within a single continuous perimeter composed of any straight line geometric figure(s) which encloses the extreme limits of the advertising message(s). If the sign is composed of individual letters or symbols using the wall as the background with no added decoration, color or embellishment, the total sign area shall be calculated by measuring the area within the perimeter of each symbol or letter. The combined area of the individual figures shall be considered the total sign area.
3. Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs
a. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-38
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
4. Measurement of Height of Sign
a. Sign height shall be measured from the elevation at the base of the sign to the highest point of the highest element of the sign, excluding any incidental structural element, such as an uplift cable for a projecting sign. Where the sign is located on a mound or berm, the average elevation of the land 20 feet to each side of the sign shall be used as a basis for measuring height.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-39
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
SECTION 14.17 POLICIES AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION
A. This Article shall be administered, enforced and construed in accordance with the following policies.
1. DISCRETIONARY REVIEW
a. When one or more signs are part of a project or development, or a variance, conditional use permit, exception or special use permit is sought for sign(s), which requires discretionary review, then the sign shall be reviewed without regard to the graphic design or visual image on the display face of the sign, and discretion shall be restricted to structural, location and other non-communicative aspects of the sign. This provision does not override the billboard policy.
2. MESSAGE NEUTRALITY
a. It is the City of Edgewood policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner.
3. REGULATIONS ON OFF-SITE MESSAGES
a. This Article distinguishes in some cases between commercial messages that relate to products or services not offered at the location of the sign (“off-site commercial messages”). The purpose of that distinction is to acknowledge the need of businesses for identification and notice of their businesses at a business location while limiting the proliferation of commercial messages generally. There is no intent to limit noncommercial messages in any way with this distinction.
4. BILLBOARD POLICY
a. New billboards, as defined herein, are prohibited. The City of Edgewood completely prohibits the construction, erection or use of any billboards, other than those which legally exist within the regulatory zoning jurisdiction of the City of Edgewood, or for which a valid permit has been issued and has not expired, as of the date on which this provision is first adopted. No permit shall be issued for any billboard which violates this policy, and the City of Edgewood will take immediate enforcement or abatement action against any billboard constructed or maintained in violation of this policy. In adopting this provision, the City of Edgewood affirmatively declares that it would have adopted this billboard policy even if it
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-40
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
were the only provision in this Article. The City of Edgewood intends for this billboard policy to be severable and separately enforceable even if other provision(s) of this Article may be declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable.
5. MESSAGE SUBSTITUTION
a. Subject to the property owner’s consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted in whole or in part for the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. In addition, any on-site commercial message may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any other on-site commercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot or land use; does not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; does not allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its mounting device; and does not allow the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message or a noncommercial message.
6. REGULATORY INTERPRETATIONS
a. All regulatory interpretations of this Article are to be exercised in light of the City of Edgewood message neutrality and message substitution policies. Where a particular type of sign is proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this Article, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a “structure” as defined in the building code then in effect, then the Zoning Administrator shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type that is expressly regulated by this Article, in light of the policies stated in this Section.
7. NONCOMMUNICATIVE ASPECTS
a. All rules and regulations concerning the non-communicative aspects of signs, such as location, size, height, illumination,
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-41
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance March 2018 PDS
spacing, orientation, etc., stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process.
8. MIXED USE ZONES AND OVERLAY ZONES
a. In any zone where both residential and non residential uses are allowed, the sign-related rights and responsibilities applicable to any particular parcel or land use shall be determined as follows: (1) if specific sign regulations are provided in the zoning district, those regulations shall be applied; or (2) if no sign regulations are provided in the zoning district, residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where a use of that type would be allowed as a matter of right, and nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a conditional use permit or similar discretionary process.
9. PROPERTY OWNER’S CONSENT
a. No sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner(s) of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this policy, “owner” means the holder of the legal title to the property and all parties and persons holding a present right to possession, control or use of the property. The signature of the property owner or authorized agent will be required on all applications for sign permits.
10. LEGAL NATURE OF SIGN RIGHTS
a. As to all signs attached to real property, the signage rights, duties and obligations arising from this Article attach to and travel with the land or other property on which a sign is mounted or displayed. This provision does not modify or affect the law of fixtures, sign-related provisions in private leases regarding signs (so long as they are not in conflict with this Article or other law), or the ownership of sign structures. This provision does not apply to hand held signs or other images which are aspects of personal appearance.
11. SEVERABILITY
a. Generally
(1) If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this Article is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of

SECTION 16.3 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY: It shall be unlawful for an owner to use or permit the use of any building or land, or part thereof, hereafter created, changed, converted, or enlarged, wholly or partly, until a certificate of occupancy, which shall be a part of the building permit, shall have been issued by the building inspector.

SECTION 16.10 INTENT CONCERNING DETERMINATIONS INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: It is the intent of this ordinance that:
A. Where investigation can be made by the zoning administrator, or other designated employee, using equipment normally available to the legislative body, such investigation shall be so made before notice of violation is issued.
B. Where technical complexity, nonavailability of equipment, or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, for the legislative body to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be established for:
1. Causing corrections in apparent violations of performance standards;
2. For protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations; and
Article XVI Administration 16-7
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
3. For protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for administration and enforcement.
C. If the zoning administrator finds, after investigations have been made by qualified experts, that there is a violation of the performance standards, he shall take, or cause to be taken, lawful action to cause correction to, within limits set by such performance standards.
SECTION 16.11 DUTIES OF ZONING ADMINISTRATOR REGARDING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: If, in the judgment of the zoning administrator, there is probable violation of the performance standards as set forth, the following procedures shall be followed:
A. The zoning administrator shall give written notice, by registered mail or certified mail, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the zoning administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation, to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of such notification. The notice shall state that failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation, to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice, constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this ordinance.
B. The notice shall further state that, upon request of those to whom said notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a qualified expert or experts and that, if violations as alleged are found, costs of such investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be paid by the legislative body.
C. If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice, but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, he shall note "violation corrected" on his copy of the notice, and shall retain it among his official records, taking such other action as may be warranted.
D. If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within the established time limit, he shall proceed to take, or cause to be taken, such action as is warranted by continuation of a violation after notice to cease.
Article XVI Administration 16-8
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
E. If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, but requesting additional time, the zoning administrator may grant an extension if he deems it warranted in the circumstances of the case and if the extension will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health, or property.
F. If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice requesting technical determination as provided in this ordinance, and if the alleged violations continue, the zoning administrator shall call in properly qualified experts to investigate and determine whether violations exist.
If expert findings indicate violations of the performance standards, the costs of the investigations shall be assessed against the properties or persons responsible for the violations, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of Section 16.9 of this ordinance.
If no violation is found, the cost of the investigation shall be paid by the legislative body without assessment against the properties or persons involved.

AMENDMENT PROCEDURE
SECTION 17.0 AMENDMENT PROCEDURE
A. FILING OF AMENDMENT APPLICATION: All applications for amendments to this ordinance shall be filed, in writing, with the zoning administrator, to be transmitted to the planning commission, on forms furnished by the zoning administrator (in duplicate). The fee required for applying for such amendment shall be as provided for by the planning commission.
B. PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW REQUIRED: A proposal for a zoning map amendment to this ordinance may originate with the planning commission, any fiscal court or legislative body, or with an owner of the property in question. A proposal to amend the text of this ordinance may originate with the planning commission or with any fiscal court or legislative body. Regardless of the origin of the proposed amendment, it shall be referred to the planning commission for its action before adoption.
C. PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED, NOTICE GIVEN
1. The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed amendment, at which hearing parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least once, but may be published two or more times, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, provided that one publication occurs not less than seven (7) calendar days nor more than twenty-one (21) calendar days before the occurrence of such hearing.
2. In addition to the public notice requirements prescribed herein, when the planning commission, fiscal court, or legislative body originates a proposal to amend the zoning map, notice of the public hearing before the planning commission, fiscal court, or legislative body shall be given at least thirty (30) days in advance of the hearing, by first class mail, to an owner of every parcel of property, the classification of which is proposed to be changed. Records by the property valuation administrator may be relied upon to determine the identity and address of said owner.
D. OTHER HEARING REQUIREMENTS, ZONING MAP AMENDMENT: In addition to the public hearing notice required in Section 17.0, C., above, the following notices shall also be given when a proposal is submitted by a property owner to amend the official zoning map:
Article XVII Amendment Procedure 17-2
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
1. Notice of the hearing shall be posted conspicuously on the property, the classification of which is proposed to be changed, for fourteen (14) consecutive days immediately prior to the hearing. Said posting shall consist of one or more signs, constructed of durable material, and clearly depicting the following information: the words "ZONING CHANGE" (three (3) inch high lettering); current zoning classification of property and proposed zoning classification (three (3) inch high lettering); date, place, and time of public hearing (one (1) inch high lettering); and address, including telephone number, of the planning commission where additional information regarding hearing may be obtained; and
2. Notice of the hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the hearing, by first class mail, with certification by the commission secretary, or other officer of the planning commission, that the notice was mailed to an owner of every parcel of property adjoining the property, the classification of which is proposed to be changed. Where said property adjoins a street or alley, property abutting the opposite side of such street or alley shall be considered adjoining property. It shall be the duty of the person(s) proposing the amendment to furnish to the planning commission the names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining property. Records maintained by the property valuation administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the event such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation administrator's records as having the same address.
3. All procedures for public notice and publication, as well as for adoption, shall be the same as for the original enactment of a zoning regulation, and the notice of publication shall include the street address of the property in question, or if one is not available, or if it is not practicable due to the number of addresses involved, a geographic description sufficient to locate and identify the property, and the names of the two (2) streets on either side of the property which intersect the street on which the property is located. If the property is located at the intersection of two (2) streets, the notice shall designate the intersection by name of both streets rather than name the two (2) streets on either side of the property.
E. FINDINGS NECESSARY FOR MAP AMENDMENT: Before any map amendment is granted, the planning commission, or legislative body, must find that the amendment is in agreement with the adopted comprehensive plan, or in the absence of such a finding, that one or more of the following apply, including the
Article XVII Amendment Procedure 17-3
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
making of a written report, setting forth explicitly, the reasons and substantiation as to how each would apply, and such finding and report shall be recorded in the minutes and records of the planning commission or legislative body.
1. That the existing zoning classification given to the property is inappropriate and that the proposed zoning classification is appropriate; and
2. That there have been major changes of an economic, physical, or social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the adopted comprehensive plan and which have substantially altered the basic character of such area.
F. MINIMUM SIZE OF NEW ZONES: No amendment to this ordinance shall be adopted whereby the zoning classification of an area is changed unless the total area being applied for meets the following requirements as to minimum size: the zoning map shall not be amended, changed, or modified in such manner as to create a free standing zone of less than five (5) acres, except where specific area restrictions are stipulated in this ordinance, or as outlined in the adopted comprehensive plan by the planning commission. For the purpose of computing the total size of an area to be rezoned for compliance herewith, there shall be added to such area: (1) the area of public rights-of-way interior to the area being changed; (2) one-half the area of public rights-of-way abutting the area being changed; and (3) the area of any land which is contiguous to the area being changed (including land located outside the jurisdiction of the legislative body but contiguous thereto and which land already bears the zoning classification sought for the area being changed). For the purpose of this section, neither continuity nor abutment shall be destroyed by the existence of a street, alley, or city's corporation line.
G. PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION
1. MAP AMENDMENT: Following the public hearing held by the planning commission on a proposed map amendment, the commission shall, within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of its receipt, make findings of fact and a recommendation of approval or disapproval of the proposed map amendment to the legislative body, including a statement setting forth explicitly the reasons and substantiation for such action and, in the case of a map amendment, the submission of a written report as required in Section 17.0, E., above. The findings of fact and recommendation shall include a summary of the evidence and testimony presented by the proponents and opponents of the proposed amendment.

The planning commission shall submit, along with their recommendations, a copy of the Development Plan and the bases for their recommendation.
c. The legislative body shall, within ninety (90) consecutive days after receiving the recommendations of the planning commission, review said recommendations and take action to approve or disapprove the proposed Development Plan. Such approval may incorporate any conditions imposed by the planning commission. However, should the legislative body take action to impose different conditions than were reviewed and recommended by the planning commission, then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the planning commission for further review and recommendations, in accordance with the process required for the initial review. Approval of the zoning map amendment shall require that development be in accordance with the approved Development Plan. Additionally, upon approval of the zoning map amendment, the official zoning map shall be amended for the area as shown on the approved development plan.

Upon expiration of said time period, and any extensions thereto, the legislative body may initiate a request for a public hearing by the planning commission, in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining whether said zoning map amendment should revert to its original designation. A public hearing may be initiated if substantial construction has not been initiated within a period of twelve (12) consecutive months from the date of approval of the Development Plan by the legislative body, provided that an extension may be permitted upon approval of the legislative body, or its duly authorized representative, if sufficient proof can be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, and that prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to render the approved Development Plan obsolete. The amount of construction that constitutes initiating substantial construction shall be as approved in the Development Plan.

(2) The board of adjustment shall further make a finding that reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a variance and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
e. In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
Article XVIII Board of Adjustment 18-6
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and punishable under Section 16.9 of this ordinance.
2. Before any variance is granted, the board of adjustment must find that the granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these findings, the board shall consider whether:
a. The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone;
b. The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and
c. The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is sought.
3. The board shall deny any request for a variance arising from circumstances that are the result of willful violations of this ordinance by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance from which relief is sought.
B. VARIANCE CANNOT CONTRADICT ZONING REGULATION: The board of adjustment shall not possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by this ordinance in the zone in question, or to alter the density of dwelling unit requirements in the zone in question.
C. VARIANCE RUNS WITH LAND: A variance applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied for it. A variance runs with the land is transferable to any future owner of land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site.
D. CHANGE FROM ONE NONCONFORMING USE TO ANOTHER: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without the specific approval of the board of adjustment, as provided herein.
Article XVIII Board of Adjustment 18-7
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
1. The board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on applications to convert or change an existing nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, subject to the following:
a. A written application for a change from one nonconforming use to another (including the required fee as per Section 19.0 of this ordinance) and a site plan, if applicable, subject to the applicable requirements of Section 9.19, shall be submitted to the board.
b. Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with Section 18.1 of this ordinance
c. The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney

In the determination of the same or more restrictive classification of use, the applicant shall establish and the board of adjustment shall find:
(1) That the new nonconforming use shall generate less vehicular traffic (automobile and truck) than the prior nonconforming use;
(2) That the new nonconforming use is of a nature which will emit less noise and air pollution than the prior nonconforming use;
(3) That the new nonconforming use will be more in character with the existing neighborhood than the prior nonconforming use, in that it is more in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan, and also, more in conformance with the uses permitted in the zone in which the use is located, than the prior nonconforming use.
e. Any change of nonconforming use granted by the board of adjustment shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance, including, but not limited to, parking requirements, sign regulations and yard requirements, and all other pertinent ordinances of the legislative body.
Article XVIII Board of Adjustment 18-8
Edgewood Zoning Ordinance December 1994 PDS
f. The board of adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at which time its use became nonconforming.

The action, limitations, and conditions imposed, if any, shall be in writing, directed to the applicant, with a copy to be furnished to the zoning administrator.
h. The change of nonconforming use, as may be granted by the board of adjustment, applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied and, therefore, cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different property.
i. In the case where the change of nonconforming use has not occurred within one (1) year after the date of granting thereof, the change of nonconforming use permit shall be null and void and reapplication to the board of adjustment shall have to be made.

WHEREAS the Kenton County Planning Commission and the Fiscal Court of Kenton County, together with its several cities, have duly prepared a comprehensive plan in accordance with KRS Chapter 100, specifically “An Update 2000-2021: Northern Kentucky’s Future - A Comprehensive Plan for Development,” adopted by Planning and Development Services of Kenton County and the Kenton County Planning Commission on December 18, 2001;
WHEREAS, Kenton County, and the incorporated municipalities within it, have long sought to regulate sexually oriented businesses within the limits of the Constitution to protect the County’s many residential neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, the adopted comprehensive plan provides the following policy guidance for regulating such businesses:
Furthermore, the Area-Wide Comprehensive Plan does not identify specific land uses, but instead, categorizes land uses using broad categories. Undesirable land uses, including adult-oriented business may be appropriate within more than one land use category identified within this Plan Update. The following criteria are presented to provide guidance for siting of these uses:
o They should not be near residential areas, schools, churches, child care facilities or other public or semi-public community facilities;
o They should not be within view of the interstate roads.
“An Update 2000-2021: Northern Kentucky’s Future - A Comprehensive Plan for Development,” pp. 5-30 – 5-31.
WHEREAS, recent reviews have found that several of the jurisdictions within Kenton County have no regulations whatsoever to deal with sexually oriented businesses as a specific land use; and
WHEREAS, there are already several sexually oriented businesses in Kenton County; and

WHEREAS, the city of Edgewood finds that the adopted comprehensive plan does not provide adequate information to allow the Planning Commission to make recommendations for the appropriate regulation of sexually oriented businesses; and
WHEREAS, the Kentucky General Assembly has adopted and the Governor has approved Kentucky 2003 H.B. 268, “an act relating to licensing massage therapists”; and
WHEREAS, county officials have long noted a difference between legitimate massage therapists and some sexually oriented businesses which present themselves as “massage parlors” or similar establishments;
WHEREAS, the Planning Commission, acting on behalf of and with funding from the Fiscal Court and the several municipalities within the County, has hired national experts in the field as consultants to study the issues of regulating sexually oriented businesses in the County; and
WHEREAS, the consultants have represented to the Planning Commission and representatives of the Fiscal Court and cities that they will deliver their preliminary report within 4 to 6 months and specific regulatory recommendations shortly thereafter; and
WHEREAS, the city of Edgewood finds that the completion of the study of sexually oriented businesses by national experts, and under the guidance of the Planning Commission, is essential to supplement the comprehensive plan; and
WHEREAS, the city of Edgewood finds that it is essential to preserve the status quo and to avoid the addition of a new sexually oriented business in what may prove to be an inappropriate location until the Planning Commission and the city of Edgewood have available to them the results of the study;

Section 3.10: Appeal of Staff Actions
(B) After the public hearing, the Planning Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove a waiver to these regulations.
(C) The Planning Commission may grant a waiver to these regulations balanced against the public
interest, providing the Planning Commission finds that the waiver will not be detrimental to the
public interest and at least one of the following criteria applies:
(1) That unusual topographical or exceptional physical conditions exist; or
(2) That strict compliance with these regulations would create an extraordinary hardship in the
face of exceptional conditions; or

Section 4.4: Pavement Design Method and Required Thicknesses
4.4-2 Required Thicknesses
(A) Table 4.4-2: Required Subdivision Street Thicknesses shows the required pavement thicknesses for
various Street classifications for Asphalt and Concrete Streets where in situ Subgrade soils can
meet the minimum required Subgrade CBR equal to 2 or greater for Concrete pavements or CBR
of 3 or greater for Asphalt pavements. These thicknesses were determined using the AASHTO
Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1986 and 1993) and the design parameters identified in
Table 4.4-1: Subdivision Pavement Design Parameters Using AASHTO Method. These values
meet requirements for a 50 year life cycle without replacement, assuming resurfacing at 17 and 34
years as shown in the example calculation in Figure C.1-A: Exhibit A.
(B) Wherever the minimum CBR values for Asphalt or Concrete pavements as defined in Table 4.4-1:
Subdivision Pavement Design Parameters Using AASHTO Method cannot be provided by the in
situ Subgrade soils, the Engineer shall: 1) submit an engineered Subgrade improvement design
that increases the CBR value of the in situ Subgrade soils to the required minimum CBR values
for Asphalt and Concrete pavement in Subsection 4.4-1: Pavement Design Method; or 2) submit an
engineered alternate pavement design that takes into account the substandard CBR values.

The purpose of pavement lugs in Subdivision pavements is to provide some additional resistance to
Contraction Joints separating during repeated expansion and contraction cycles over the life of the
pavement in certain open ended and relatively steep downhill pavement conditions. In these open
ended and downhill conditions, resistance to pavement lengthening at contraction joints is
substantially reduced as compared to Contraction Joints in long stretches relatively straight
pavement. In the long, relatively straight streets, the repetitive adjacent slabs help keep the
contraction joints from separating during repeated expansion and contraction cycles. Those
conditions which shall require lugs are related to the geometry of the Streets and are as follows (see
Figure A.1-J: Detail #8, Figure A.1-K: Detail #9, and Figure A.1-L: Detail #10).
(1) The ends of Cul-de-sacs where the Street grade approaching the Cul-de-sac decreases more
than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more than six percent, before there is a change
in direction of Street Drainage. In this condition, install a lug near the end of the Cul-de-sac
across the extension of the two lanes of pavement.
(2) At T-intersections, place a lug on the intersecting street near the intersection, where grade on
the intersecting Street is going up from the intersection more than 20 feet vertically, at an
average grade of more than six percent, before there is a change in the Drainage direction.
(3) On the main line of a Street pavement where the pavement is going straight and downhill
more than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more than six percent and the direction of
centerline deflects horizontally by more than 30 degrees, place a lug just uphill of the start of
the horizontal curve.
a) Lugs shall be placed at least 20 feet uphill from any shallow utility excavation
transverse to the pavement.
(4) The Design Engineer may add other lugs in conditions he considers critical to Contraction
Joint integrity.
(5) Lug locations are to be shown on construction design and as-built drawings.
(J) Joint Sealing Compound
(1) Joint sealing compound shall conform to the following standard designations:
a) Hot-poured elastic type, as specified by AASHTO, latest edition; or
b) Silicone rubber sealant type (non-sag, self-leveling, or rapid cure) conforming to the
KYTC Department of Highways Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, latest edition; or
c) An approved equal, as determined and approved by Staff.

FACTS AND SUPPORT FOR HOW THE REGULATIONS REGARDING STREET PAVEMENT
AND EARTHWORK WERE DERIVED AND INCORPORATED INTO Article 4: Public and Private
Infrastructure AND Article 6: Geotechnical Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements.
4.8-1 Purpose
Pavement in Public Streets, including Subdivision Streets, is one of the largest physical assets by dollar
value owned by various Kenton County legislative bodies (city/county). The purpose of this section is
twofold. The first is to inform all in Kenton County who have responsibilities in the design, construction
and maintenance of Subdivision Streets of important facts about the nature of pavements and their
individual responsibilities in obtaining good long-term pavement performance in new Kenton County
Subdivisions.
The second is to set out some of the critical engineering analysis and reasoning used to establish the
pavement, pavement Subgrade, and pavement Drainage specifications for future Subdivision pavement
contained in Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure, Section 4.4: Pavement Design Method and
Required Thicknesses through Section 4.7: Asphalt Concrete (Asphalt) Paving Mixture and Construction
Specifications, and Article 6: Geotechnical Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements of
these regulations.

Existing Subdivision Pavement 4.8-2 Performance Analysis
During the process of reviewing this 2014 update of the Kenton County Subdivision Regulations there
was a substantial community discussion on Subdivision pavement design, construction and performance.
During the late stages of this community discussion, at the suggestion of the Kenton County Judge
Executive and several city Mayors, and authorization of the Planning Commission Chairman, a
committee of five local pavement professionals with extensive and long-term experience in the design,
construction, and maintenance of Subdivision pavements was formed. This committee was asked, as a
voluntary community service, to do the following: analyze existing Subdivision pavement performance,
evaluate that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance, and make
recommendations that would improve pavement customer value in future Subdivision pavements. All
earlier community discussion on pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process.
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report contains this committee’s final report to the Planning
Commission in this regard. The recommendations of this report were an important source of information
that was used in the formation of these Subdivision pavement regulations.
4.8-3 Important Pavement Facts
There is no perfect pavement, no pavement lasts indefinitely, and all pavements require maintenance,
repair and refurbishment on a timely basis in order to minimize long term pavement costs. All
professional pavement design procedures recognize that all pavements will eventually fail, regardless of
how well they are built, either by the impacts of weathering, the impacts of repetitive heavy vehicle axle
loads, or both. Professional engineering pavement design also recognizes pavement will have local
failures during its life because of the imperfect nature of the natural soil Subgrade, pavement materials,
and construction techniques. Pavements designed by pavement professionals are, therefore, designed
with assumptions and calculations of the need for maintenance, repair of isolated failures, and
refurbishment during the pavement life. All pavement literature recognizes that the three essential
components of good pavement performance are (A) proper pavement design for the in situ conditions,
(B) proper construction consistent with the design, and (C) proper and timely maintenance and repair.
Failure in the proper execution of any one of these three components will lead to very substantial
increases in long term pavement cost and/or inadequate pavement serviceability. These three
components are discussed further below.
(A) Pavement Design
The following is a discussion of certain important elements of the engineering approach taken to
establish the pavement design, materials and construction methods specified for Subdivision
Streets in Section 4.4: Pavement Design Method and Required Thicknesses through Section 4.7:
Asphalt Concrete (Asphalt) Paving Mixture and Construction Specifications, and Article 6:
Geotechnical Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements.
(1) Proper pavement engineering design requires economic analysis of pavement design
alternatives. For an in-depth discussion of the engineering economics of pavements, see
Chapter 3 of the AASHTO ’93 Pavement Design Manual. The economic engineering design
objective used herein is to minimize pavement 50 year net present value life cycle costs to
the pavement Customer while maintaining adequate pavement serviceability. The pavement
“Customer” is defined as the amalgamation of the Subdivision Lot/home purchaser,
occupant, tax payer and citizen. There is no attempt to differentiate any of these Customer
subgroups. Collectively, they are the pavement Customer.
The Customer pays all of the costs of pavement through Lot/home purchase price, rent, and
various forms of taxes.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 120
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Pavement cost over the pavement life cycle includes construction costs; maintenance, repair
and refurbishment costs; and costs related to the time value of money (thus net present
value). These various costs include any overhead and profit that is related to the goods and
services provided.
A 50 year life cycle was chosen for the analysis period because there is substantial local
experience that demonstrates Subdivision pavements, when properly designed, built,
maintained, and resurfaced, can last 50 years or more. A longer analysis period was not
chosen because transportation modes and pavement loading, maintenance and repair methods
and materials, and all sorts of other related factors, are simply not foreseeable beyond 50
years. Pavement designs herein are also designed with a 20 year design life or performance
period, defined as the time that an initial pavement will last before it needs rehabilitation.
Pavement designs presented herein are designed to last at least 50 years, as long as properly
constructed, maintained, and resurfaced over the 50 year period as shown in Subsection 4.8-
3(C): Pavement Maintenance herein. Figure A.1-AA: Detail #25 also shows a method of
extending the pavement life past 50 years using existing refurbishment and resurfacing
methods.
Any alternate pavement design submitted for a particular Subdivision by a pavement design
professional must also include a 20 year design life and a 50 year life cycle maintenance,
repair, and resurfacing analysis, including relevant traffic loading.
(2) The pavement Subgrade is the soil directly under the pavement. Pavements rely on the
Subgrade for structural support. Subgrades must, therefore, be constructed of soils with
adequate load bearing capacity, properly prepared.
Portland Cement Concrete (“Concrete”) is a rigid pavement and spreads traffic loads over a
larger Subgrade area as compared to Asphalt Cement Concrete (“Asphalt”) pavement which
is a flexible pavement. Because of this wheel load distribution difference in the nature of
these two pavement types, Asphalt pavements require a higher minimum Subgrade bearing
capacity than Concrete pavements.
Pavement specifications herein require Subgrade soils that, when properly prepared, will
produce a bearing capacity or California Bearing Ratio (“CBR”) of 2 or greater for Concrete
pavement and CBR of 3 or greater for Asphalt pavement.
A substantial majority (not all) of potential future Subdivision sites in Kenton County have
natural soils that, when properly prepared, will produce an adequate Subgrade bearing
capacity to support Concrete or Asphalt, but not necessarily both. For Subdivision locations
with in situ soils that will not produce these minimum bearing capacities for the pavement
type that the Developer selects, properly designed and built Subgrade improvements will be
required.
Quality control of as-built Subgrades is a very important component of assuring the expected
pavement design performance.
(3) The repetition of Equivalent 18,000 Pound Single Axle Loads (“ESALs”) going over the
pavement during its life is one mode of eventual pavement failure. Therefore, estimates of
ESALs are required to properly design pavements. Pavement designs herein include ESAL
loading estimates during land development construction, building construction, and traffic
activity after full building occupancy. The estimate methods and quantities are shown in
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 121
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Figure C.1-A: Exhibit A. Any alternate pavement designs must be based on these ESAL
estimates, or greater.
(4) Pavement surface and subsurface storm water conditions are another important consideration
in pavement design. The primary engineering design methods for minimizing the negative
effects of storm water on pavement and pavement Subgrades are (1) preventing water from
entering the pavement, (2) providing Drainage that quickly removes excess water that enters
the pavement, and (3) building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of
wheel load and water. Because Asphalt is more porous and has higher reliance on Subgrade
strength as compared to Concrete pavement, accounting for the potential negative effects of
water entering Asphalt pavements and pavement Subgrade is more critical for Asphalt
pavements.
The design features specified in these regulations use all three methods listed above to
minimize the negative effects of storm water on Subdivision pavement.
The primary pavement requirements used in these regulations for effective storm water
surface and subsurface management are as follows:
a) Rural Development Streets
i) Three percent surface cross slope, as shown in Figure A.1-E: Detail #5 and
Figure A.1-F: Detail #6.
ii) Subgrade cross slope of three percent for Concrete Streets and three percent +2
inches for Asphalt Streets, as shown in Figure A.1-C: Detail #3, Figure A.1-D:
Detail #4, Figure A.1-E: Detail #5, and Figure A.1-F: Detail #6.
iii) Drainage ditches on both sides of the Street where the ditch depth is always
deeper than the Subgrade at the outside edge of pavement, as shown in Figure
A.1-E: Detail #5, and Figure A.1-F: Detail #6.
b) Suburban and Urban Streets
Most Subdivision pavements likely to be built in Kenton County will be classified as
urban or suburban. These Streets are built with curb and gutter. The pavement with
curb and gutter serves as a surface storm water conduit which is designed to collect
surface storm water off the Street and off adjoining Subdivision lots and transport that
storm water to Street catch basins which connect to storm sewers. Street design
requirements herein are designed to get and keep storm water in the gutter flow line of
these Streets as much as practical.
i) All Streets
a) Curb and gutter and three percent surface cross grade to get and keep storm
water in the gutter line until it is collected at catch basins (see Figure A.1-C:
Detail #3 and Figure A.1-D: Detail #4.
b) Build Public Sidewalk so that the edge nearest the Street is built six inches
above the adjacent Curb on sloped Curbs and three inches above the Curb on
Barrier Curbs. This maintains positive street Drainage even after multiple
pavement overlays (see Figure A.1-C: Detail #3 and Figure A.1-D: Detail
#4).
c) Install continuous edge drain at the outside edge of the pavement on both
sides of the Street, as shown in Figure A.1-C: Detail #3, Figure A.1-D:
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 122
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Detail #4, Figure A.1-X: Detail #22, and Figure A.1-Y: Detail #23. This
edge drain will help drain the Subgrade, help keep surface water from the
outside edge of the pavement out of the Subgrade, and will help drain Joints
in Concrete and the Asphalt/Concrete Curb and gutter interface.
d) Provide for Subgrade Drainage and edge drain Drainage at all paired catch
basins, as shown on the Required Street Cross Section Construction at Catch
Basin Crossings in Figure A.1-B: Detail #2.
ii) Concrete Streets
a) All pavement Joints are properly sealed with joint sealing compound to
minimize water penetrating those Joints and getting into the Subgrade.
b) All pavements are built with a three percent Subgrade cross grade (see
Figure A.1-C: Detail #3 and Figure A.1-E: Detail #5) continuous from
centerline to edge of Curb, which will help any water that gets into the
Subgrade to the outside of the Curb and to the edge drain.
iii) Asphalt Streets
a) The surface course of Asphalt has been designed to minimize the water that
will penetrate the pavement and get into the Subgrade.
b) The finish course of Asphalt is built ¼ inch above the Curb apron to force
any surface water toward the gutter line rather than allow the water to lay out
in the pavement surface for extended periods of time.
c) The Curb apron is built with a six percent cross pitch to keep water in the
gutter line.
d) The Asphalt Joint at the Concrete Curb apron is sealed with Joint sealer to
keep water from penetrating through that Joint into the Subgrade.
e) The Subgrade is built with a three percent plus two inch cross slope and is
built continuously from the centerline to the outside of the Curb to help drain
the Subgrade and help minimize the potential for water penetrating into the
Subgrade from the outside edge of the pavement.
f) The first course of pavement base (Asphalt or KYTC crushed stone base) is
continuous from the centerline to the outside edge of the pavement, and the
Concrete Curb and gutter is built on top of the first course of base, which
will help keep water from penetrating the Subgrade at the outside edge of the
pavement and will help support the Curb and reduce potential for Curb
breakage.
In regards to “…building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of wind
and water,” the Subgrade design parameters used in Table 4.4-1 account for substantial
Kenton County seasonal variability in Subgrade support consistent with substantial change in
water content of Subgrade soils season-to-season.
(5) There are many other design, material, and construction method details set out in Section 4.4:

Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements, and Appendix A: Standard

Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Construction Drawings that are important to good pavement performance. Because these
details are not discussed here does not diminish their importance.
(B) Pavement Construction Quality Control
Construction quality control, which means building the pavement with good construction practices
and in substantial conformance with these Subdivision regulations and the approved construction
design drawings, is the responsibility of the Subdivision Developer and its agents who are the
Engineers and construction Contractors hired by that Developer to design and build that
Subdivision’s improvements. The Planning Commission’s role in construction quality control is,
through its Staff or other quality control service provider, to confirm and document that the
Subdivision design drawings satisfy these regulations and that the in-place Subdivision
improvements are built in substantial accordance to these Subdivision regulations and the
Subdivision design drawings.
(C) Pavement Maintenance
The need for and benefit of timely and adequate maintenance by the Street pavement’s owners is
documented throughout the pavement literature. Failure to properly and timely maintain
pavements will lead to substantially increased Customer pavement costs and/or diminished
pavement serviceability.
(1) Recommended 50 Year Life Cycle Maintenance
The following is a schedule for maintenance, repair, and resurfacing that can be expected in
an effort to minimize Customer 50 year life cycle costs for Subdivision pavements.
a) Recommended Asphalt Pavement Owner Maintenance
Minor Maintenance:
• Joint and crack seal every three years
• Spot Curb repair
• Spot pavement repair
Major Maintenance:
• At approximately +17 years:
- Spot Curb repair, as necessary
- Spot base repair
- Mill Asphalt two inches deep at the Concrete Curb apron to zero inches at
six feet out from the Curb Apron
- Install new two inch Asphalt surface with a four percent Curb apron to
centerline cross slope.
- Seal the Asphalt/Curb Apron interface
• At approximately +34 years:
- Spot Curb repair
- Spot base repair
- Pavement fabric over joint between Asphalt and Curb
- New two inch Asphalt surface overlay
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015

Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
b) Recommended Concrete Pavement Owner Maintenance
Minor Maintenance:
• Joint and crack seal every three years
• Inspect Driveway apron expansion material for signs of pavement lengthening;
take remedial action as necessary (See Subsection 4.8-3(C)(1)c): Management
of Concrete Pavement Lengthening, below.)
• Localized failure repairs
Major Maintenance:
• At approximately +17 years:
- Spot Curb repair
- Spot slab repair
• At approximately +34 years:
- Spot Curb repair
- Spot slab and Joint repair
- Inspect for erosion (tunneling) under pavement, mud jack as necessary
- Mill Concrete two inches deep at or near the Concrete gutter line to zero
inches deep six feet out from the gutter line.
- Install Asphalt skim coat and Stress Absorbing Asphalt Membrane
Interlayer (SAMI) over the width of the pavement.
- Install 1½-inch deep Asphalt surface overlay with a four percent gutter line
to centerline cross slope.
c) Management of Concrete Pavement Lengthening
Concrete pavements can expand in length later in the pavement’s life as described on
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report - Problem #12(b). While the
pavement design features incorporated into this regulation along with proper owner
pavement maintenance will minimize this lengthening, the potential for lengthening
and the related potential negative impacts cannot be eliminated.
The design feature incorporated into these regulations which will allow for the
identification and management of any potential negative impacts to improvements on
private property is the placement of a total of three inches of expansion joint material
within the Street Right-of-way at each Driveway apron, as shown in Figure A.1-T:
Detail #18, Figure A.1-U: Detail #19, and Figure A.1-V: Detail #20.
The pavement owners’ regular inspection (every three years) of the expansion material
to see if the three inches of expansion material has “closed up” to two inches or less is
required. If the expansion material has “closed up” to two inches or less, remedial
action consisting of saw cutting the Driveway apron next to the Curb to allow for
additional expansion is required.
The preceding is one set of proven long-term pavement management strategies that
have been used on Northern Kentucky Subdivision Streets. There are others that have
been effective. When these strategies are properly and timely executed on pavement
designs in these regulations (properly constructed), the result should be satisfactory
pavement performance for at least 50 years without pavement replacement.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 125
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
As new, more cost effective maintenance and repair strategies are developed over time,
they should be adopted for use.
(2) Extending Pavement Life Beyond 50 Years
Figure A.1-AA: Detail #25 shows a methodology of extending pavement life that should
allow most Subdivision pavements, properly built and maintained under these regulations, to
have their life extended beyond 50 years without replacement. Obviously, many things can
and likely will change over the next 50 years that will substantially change the best course of
action for refurbishment or replacement of these Subdivision pavements.

Section 5.1: Purpose
Article 5: Green Infrastructure (GI) Options
Section 5.1: Purpose
5.1-1 Green infrastructure uses natural processes to ameliorate the negative effects of urban development,
including reducing heat island effects, air pollution, water pollution and excess storm water runoff.
Integrated stormwater management is a subset of green infrastructure. The use of integrated stormwater
management is encouraged because of its connection to effective development practices and
environmental quality. The influence of the natural flow regime (hydrology) of a given watershed on
overall stream integrity (chemical, physical, biological) is well established, and as such, maintaining the
natural flow regime is a priority for stormwater managers. The proper use of integrated stormwater
management practices can achieve this goal and dramatically improve stormwater runoff quality,
decrease runoff volume, reduce infrastructure costs, protect the integrity of downstream streams and
rivers, and create more interesting places to live. Stormwater management practices include a broader
understanding of watershed management and ecosystem function, coupled with overall site design and
layout, and implementation of an impervious area reduction strategy. The creation of impervious
surfaces on a site can dramatically impact a community’s watersheds, wastewater treatment systems, and
water supplies by altering the landscape’s inherent ability to slow, filter, and absorb stormwater runoff
(i.e. alters the natural flow regime). Development or redevelopment of a site can be accomplished while
reducing the overall negative impact to receiving streams, by applying carefully considered stormwater
management techniques which mimic natural hydrology. To further these more general purposes, this
article:
(A) Establishes site design components to promote more effective use of individual stormwater
management techniques to prevent negative impacts rather than mitigating them;
(B) Provides the ability to utilize simple, nonstructural methods for stormwater management that are
lower cost and lower maintenance than structural controls;
(C) Encourages the management of stormwater as close to the point of origin as possible and
minimizes collection and conveyance, establishing a strategy to determine what portions of
stormwater are to be filtered into the ground on site and what portions of stormwater are to flowthrough
the site for management elsewhere;
(D) Provides benefits to the environment as well as to the development community by improving water
quality and restoring aquatic habitats while controlling flooding. This approach can increase
rainfall infiltration and groundwater recharge with potentially large environmental benefits and
potentially lower net costs – both to the environment and to the Developer. The integrated
stormwater management techniques provide innovative options for Developers to rethink overall
site design and layout to utilize a site more efficiently while providing better stormwater
management opportunities than traditional gray infrastructure;
(E) Uses multiple impervious area reduction techniques within the context of an overall site design to
reduce the negative runoff impact created with the development or redevelopment of a site and
ideally reduce the amount of underground pipe infrastructure necessary on a site;

Article 5: Green Infrastructure (GI) Options
Section 5.2: Site Layout Strategies
(F) Promotes the aesthetic value of integrated stormwater management. In addition to the benefits of
maintaining healthy waterways and the multiple environmental benefits supporting healthy
communities found in the use of integrated stormwater management, the use of these techniques
can provide aesthetic value to a community with the use of added vegetation to the landscape. By
integrating natural processes into the built environment, these techniques provide stormwater
management, Flood mitigation and control, and air quality management with more aesthetic appeal
than standard gray stormwater infrastructure.
Section 5.2: Site Layout Strategies
5.2-1 Overall site layout strategies are encouraged to be incorporated into an integrated stormwater
management plan. Site layout strategies are the first step in managing stormwater in a way that mimics
natural hydrology. Using land more efficiently for development, preserving critical ecological areas, and
reducing runoff through better site design are vital to maintaining a healthy watershed. Stormwater
management works most effectively in conjunction with an overall site design strategy which identifies
how the stormwater impacts created by the development will be addressed.
5.2-2 A site design strategy should include identification of which portions of expected stormwater will be
managed using either infiltration methods, retention methods, or flow-through methods. Shifting the
focus toward the utilization of rainwater as a resource that should be managed as close to where it falls as
possible and away from addressing rainwater solely as a waste that should be removed from a site will
increase the efficiency of stormwater management.
5.2-3 Effective stormwater management will utilize multiple methods aimed at managing runoff through both
infiltration into natural systems as well as use of management methods which remove water from the site
through piping infrastructure without adding significant impacts to local waterways and watersheds. The
elements work collectively to lessen the negative impacts to nearby waterways and watershed systems.
5.2-4 Efficiently designing a site should include conscious efforts to minimize the impervious areas created by
new streets, pedestrian pathways, parking Lots, and/or buildings.
Section 5.3: Elements of Integrated Stormwater Management
5.3-1 The following elements are examples of integrated stormwater management which, when used in
coordination with effective site design strategies, can aid in lowering the negative impact to local
waterways and watersheds. Once a strategy has been established to minimize collection and conveyance,
these elements can be utilized, in varying combinations, to successfully implement stormwater to be
filtered into the ground on site and stormwater to flow-through the site for management elsewhere.

Section 5.3: Elements of Integrated Stormwater Management
(A) Narrower Right-of-way Widths
Whether used in conjunction with narrower pavement widths or traditional width pavements,
narrowing the Right-of-way established within a site is a significant opportunity to reduce the
quantity and increase the quality of storm water runoff by allowing structures to be set closer to the
street. Because of the topography that is typical for this region, many developments involve land
that includes ridge tops, hillside slopes and headwater streams. As such, development plans often
include streets and structures constructed along ridge tops with back yards that extend down the
hillside slopes and into headwater streams. Placing structures closer to the ridge top lessens the
need for earthwork and tree removal along these hillside slopes which keeps more undisturbed land
on the slopes and near the headwater streams. In addition to the added benefit of helping to ensure
hillside stability, lessening hillside disturbance and tree removal will result in a lesser impact to the
natural flow regime, and therefore a lesser impact to water quantity and water quality in these
headwater streams as well as the corresponding receiving streams downstream of the site. See
Figure 5.3-A.

Section 5.3: Elements of Integrated Stormwater Management
(B) Grassy Swales (Bioretention Swales) Without Curb and Gutter and Grassy Swales With
Curb and Gutter Containing Cut-outs and Flumes
Swales are long and narrow depressions in the landscape which incorporate vegetation to gradually
move stormwater through a site by use of gentle slopes to guide runoff through the system. Swales
are primarily used to slow the speed of stormwater runoff as it moves through a site though some
infiltration can occur when slopes (less than five percent) and soils are favorable. The vegetation
used within swales typically requires lower ongoing maintenance than that of traditional
landscaping. When used in combination with Curb and gutter containing cutouts and flumes, the
swales provide the same benefit as traditional swales without Curb and gutter by collecting
stormwater outside of traditional gray infrastructure associated with the site and decreasing the
impacts of development to the overall man-made stormwater management system. However this
system offers the added benefit of providing Curb and gutter along the edge of streets to help
buttress asphalt pavements, create a well-defined pavement edge and increase the overall pavement
edge lifespan. See Figure 5.3-B and Figure 5.3-C.

(C) Infiltration Gardens (Biofiltration Swales or Rain Gardens)
Infiltration gardens are shallow depressions in the landscape which provide larger, often unused or
left-over areas on a site to filter stormwater into the natural soils and groundwater system. Use of
infiltration gardens can significantly lessen the amount of stormwater collected into piping
infrastructure. The vegetation used within infiltration gardens typically requires lower ongoing
maintenance than that of traditional landscaping. See Figure 5.3-D.

(D) Pedestrian Walkways as a Design Element
Alternative pedestrian ways which are outside of the requirements set forth in Table 4.1-1 can be
created to constitute a pedestrian circulation system equal to the level of effectiveness that
traditional Sidewalk on one or both sides of the street would provide. Rather than including
Sidewalks only within the Right-of-way along the Street, integrating a well thought out pedestrian
circulation system throughout a site can reduce impervious surface while potentially lowering the
construction cost and raising the stormwater management benefits of the overall site. Incorporating
a strategic system of Pedestrian Walkways linking key destinations within a site (in conjunction
with aligning connections for travel outside the site) will increase usability of walkway networks.
Additionally, incorporating materials such as mulch, gravel, or other pervious material can further
reduce the hard surface runoff. When adding Sidewalks to one or both sides of every street, often
important pedestrian connections are not made, the Sidewalks themselves are under (if-at-all)
utilized, and excessive impervious surfaces are created.

(E) Planter Boxes
Planters are long narrow, often rectangular landscaped areas with vertical walls and flat, unsloped
bottoms, and are able to store a greater volume of water than swales, because they are typically
deeper, and provide more capacity. Water flows into the planter, absorbs into the topsoil and
plants, fills to a predetermined overflow elevation, and discharges into the overflow system
provided. Two types of planters are used for stormwater management.
(1) Flow-through Planters
Flow-through planters have a sealed bottom and sides and absorb only as much water as the
soil and plants in the planter can accommodate. They allow water to slowly travel through
the soil profile prior to overflowing into a subsurface underdrain system. See Figure 5.3-F.

(F) Permeable Pavement
If underlying soils allow for the natural infiltration of rain water, constructing pavement using
permeable materials can allow for stormwater to filter through the pavement and into the natural
ground water system while still providing the structural integrity necessary for the site’s
automobile and pedestrian traffic. The use of Permeable Pavement can mitigate the overall impact
of the development to the piping infrastructure systems while maintaining full functionality of the
developed site. See Figure 5.3-H, Figure 5.3-I, and Figure 5.3-J.

(G) Preserving Existing Trees and Planting New Trees
Preserving trees and planting new trees on a site adds to the ability to effectively slow, absorb, and
filter rainwater. Trees naturally work to physically slow the flow of water through a site by
intercepting stormwater on their leaf surfaces as well as through their root structure. Not only do
trees collect water for their growth, their physical presence on the landscape intercepts the flow of
water downhill and slows its movement. See Figure 5.3-K.

By-Right
5.5-1 The following two Integrated Stormwater Management elements are permitted to be used in two separate
and distinct methods. These elements are permitted to be used as elements of Integrated Stormwater
Management anywhere in Kenton County when the criteria outlined in Section 5.4-1 have been
substantiated. However, the “by-right” use of the following Integrated Stormwater Management
elements can be utilized without requiring that any special conditions be met, as long as the element is
being used in the specific applications outlined as follows:
(A) Narrower Pavement Widths
Narrowing pavement widths is a significant opportunity to reduce stormwater runoff by reducing
the total amount of impervious surface and therefore, reducing the amount of stormwater requiring
collection into pipe infrastructure for maintenance off-site. The use of narrower pavement widths
is allowed by-right when used in conjunction with a Rural Development type. Rural Development
types are single and two-family residential developments that contain lot widths equal to or greater
than 300 feet and contain no on street parking. See Subsection 4.1-10: Allowable Pavement
Design.
(B) Grassy Swales and Shoulders Without Curb and Gutter
Swales are long and narrow depressions in the landscape which incorporate vegetation to gradually
move stormwater through a site by use of gentle slopes to guide runoff through the system. Swales
are primarily used to slow the speed of stormwater runoff as it moves through a site though some
infiltration can occur when slopes (less than five percent) and soils are favorable. When used
without curb and gutter systems, swales can more easily collect stormwater uninhibited by the
physical barriers created by traditional Curbs. Additionally, without the traditional gutter system,
stormwater can more easily flow directly into swales (infiltration systems) rather than into manmade
stormwater management system. Grassy swales and shoulders without curb and gutter is
allowed by-right when used in certain situations such as: (1) in developments that prohibit on-street
parking and contain minimum Lot widths that equal or exceed 300 feet; or (2) along streets that
serve as an entrance to the development and contain no residences and no parking. See Subsection
4.1-13: Roadside Swales.

Section 6.2: Earthwork Specifications, Evaluation, Material Testing and Reporting for Earthwork Within the Public Street
Right-of-Way and Private Street Easements, and Areas Structurally Supporting the Public Street Right-of-Way and Private
Street Easements
(2) The Subgrade shall consist of cohesive soils, clean #57 crushed limestone, crushed stone
base, or Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM). Any aggregate material used to replace
part of the cohesive Subgrade soil must be drained, per Figure A.1-W: Detail #21 so that no
standing water can collect and be held in the aggregate Subgrade.
(3) Clean granular soils that do not exhibit a well-defined moisture-density curve shall be
compacted to a firm, non-yielding condition and to at least 80 percent relative density as
determined by the testing methods contained in ASTM D4253 and D4254, latest edition.

inspector for conformity with the cross section shown on the approved Improvement
Drawings immediately prior to placing the pavement. Pavement shall not be placed on any
part of the Subgrade which does not conform to the cross section shown on the approved
Improvement Drawings.
(C) Final Subgrade Proofrolling
(1) Proofrolling is the final test to be performed immediately prior to beginning the paving
operations.
(2) Prior to the placement of pavement materials and after confirming proper density and
moisture content of the Subgrade soils, all Street Subgrades shall be proofrolled to test the
stability and uniformity of Subgrade materials.

aggregate.
(4) Proofrolling shall be performed at walking speed with at least two passes made in each drive
lane direction with the outside wheel generally traveling along the inside line of the future
Curb during one pass, and the wheel-paths offset one-half of the truck width during the
second pass to maximize subgrade coverage. Extra proofroll passes shall be made at the
discretion of the Staff inspector.

Street Easements
(6) In all cases, repaired areas shall be retested for compaction and proofrolled again before
proceeding with the placement of pavement materials. Rutting can typically be repaired by
scarifying, aerating, and recompacting, while areas of pumping will more likely require a
more significant repair with depth often including the removal and replacement of unsuitable
Subgrade materials.
(D) Final Subgrade Inspection Testing and Reporting Requirements
(1) Both the Staff inspector and the Geotechnical Technician have final Subgrade review,
testing, and reporting responsibilities.
(2) The Geotechnical Engineer shall provide soil testing to develop an opinion of adequate
bearing characteristics of the final Subgrade soils. Those tests will include, but are not
limited to, moisture content testing, density testing, and verification of soil types being
adequate to produce the required CBR values for the pavement. Moisture content testing,
density testing, and verification of soil types being adequate to produce the required CBR
values for the pavement shall be performed by the Geotechnical Engineer at intervals no less
than one test per 100 lineal feet of Street for Streets of 500 lineal feet or less, or one test per
200 lineal feet for Streets over 500 lineal feet.
(3) The Geotechnical Technician and the Staff Inspector shall review the proofrolling described
in Subsection 6.2-7(C): Final Subgrade Proofrolling and determine whether the Subgrade
passes the proofroll.
(4) Paving operations shall only be permitted to begin after passing inspection results are
achieved from Subsection 6.2-7: Street Pavement Subgrade, Subsection 6.2-7(C): Final
Subgrade Proofrolling, and Clause 6.2-7(D)(2). Inspection reports referenced in Clause 6.2-
7(D)(1) and Clause 6.2-7(D)(2) shall be placed in the Staff project file and Staff shall make
their inspection records available to the Developer.
(5) Street paving shall occur within 30 hours after passing inspection results are achieved from
Clause 6.2-7(D)(1) and Clause 6.2-7(D)(2). A ¼ inch rain event or sub-freezing temperature
occurrence between a passing proofroll and Street paving shall void the proofroll and
geotechnical testing and shall require re-evaluation.
(6) For concrete pavements, small pours of up to one hundred square yards to complete
intersections, cul-de-sacs, etc. do not require subgrade re-proofrolling after initially passing a
proofroll as part of a large subgrade preparations and testing. Moisture conditioning and rerolling
may be required.
Controlled 6.2-8 Low Strength Material
(A) CLSM may be used in place of compacted clayey soils to uniformly backfill utility trenches,
manholes, etc.
(B) CLSM shall not be used in place of clean, free-draining #57 crushed limestone specified for and
intended as Drainage backfill around catch basins and manholes or in trench drains, such as
between catch basin pairs.

7.4-1 Analysis Scenarios
(A) The TIS shall examine the before and after conditions within the study area to a degree sufficient to
document the operational and safety impacts of the proposed development and access plan. The
before and after conditions shall be termed the “No Build” and “Build” conditions.
(B) The “No Build” condition shall include:
(1) Existing traffic volumes forecasted to the appropriate analysis year;
(2) Existing Street geometry,
(3) All applicable Traffic Control devices;
(4) Any traffic generated by proposed adjacent developments;
(5) Any funded Improvements within the study area; and
(6) Any Transportation System Management (TSM) Improvements, such as signal timing and/or
phasing optimization and reconfiguration of existing lane uses that may improve the
operation of the transportation system.
(C) The “Build” condition shall include:
(1) “No Build” traffic volumes;
(2) Site generated traffic; and
(3) Any Street Improvements proposed with the development.
(D) “No Build” and “Build” analysis shall be conducted for the anticipated year of opening and a
design year assuming a 10-year horizon. Opening year “Build” analysis should only include that
portion of development which is anticipated to be completed at opening. Design year analysis
shall include the full build-out potential of the development. In the event that the full build-out of
the development is anticipated to extend beyond the 10-year horizon, the design year shall be the
anticipated year of full build-out.
(E) All scenarios evaluated shall include analysis of the weekday AM and PM peak hours. The
Applicant should work with Staff to determine whether the peak hour of the development or the
peak hour of the adjacent Street traffic is to be analyzed to evaluate the worst-case scenario. When
a proposed development is anticipated to generate a high volume of traffic during non-traditional
peaks, such as a noon peak, late night or weekend peak period, these periods should also be
examined. The need to study additional periods of operation shall be at the discretion of Staff.
7.4-2 Data Collection
The data collection efforts for the study shall be consistent with the level of analysis required. At a
minimum this shall include two-hour turning movement counts conducted in 15-minute intervals at all
study intersections for all peak periods examined. When traffic patterns are affected by the presence of
non-traditional peaks such as school trips, the peak hour turning movement count shall be expanded to
include both peak periods. The peak hours should be determined by a 24-hour count of the adjacent
Street traffic on a typical weekday (i.e., Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday). Previously collected data
and traffic volumes may be used in the analysis at the discretion of Staff.

Article 7: Traffic Impact Studies
Section 7.4: Study Requirements
7.4-3 Future Traffic Volumes
Future traffic volumes used to evaluate the opening year (if different from existing year) and design year
conditions shall be determined by applying an appropriate growth rate to reflect anticipated changes in
demand on the Street network. This growth rate shall be determined from comparison of historical traffic
volumes in the study area. Other methods of forecasting traffic volumes, such as socio-economic
analysis and the use of travel demand models may also be used to determine future traffic growth rates at
the discretion of Staff.
7.4-4 Trip Generation and Distribution
(A) Trips generated by the proposed development shall be calculated using the most current edition of
the ITE Trip Generation Manual methodologies.
(B) Trips generated by the development should be distributed onto the Public Street network consistent
with existing traffic patterns in the area, identified by origin destination studies of adjacent
developments or traffic counts of adjacent Streets. This methodology may be replaced with more
refined trip distribution approaches derived from market research studies, travel demand models, or
other methodologies at the discretion of Staff.
7.4-5 Operational Analysis
Operational analysis shall be conducted for all intersections within the study area for all analysis
scenarios identified in Subsection 7.4-1: Analysis Scenarios. At a minimum, operational analysis shall
include, but is not limited to:

should be consistent with Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)/Highway Capacity Software (HCS)
methodologies for unsignalized and signalized intersections. Roundabout analysis shall utilize
RODEL/ARCADY analytical procedures. Analysis results should be summarized with LOS and
delay by lane group and intersection totals. For roundabout analysis, LOS shall be determined
using both signalized and unsignalized HCM thresholds.
(B) Analysis shall be evaluated using the following parameters unless justified by additional study at
the discretion of Staff.
(1) Peak Hour Factor (PHF) = 0.90
(2) Lost Time = 2.0 sec
(3) No right turns on red (RTOR)
(4) HCS arrival type = 3
(5) Yellow and red clearance intervals shall be calculated based on ITE recommended
procedures.
(6) Pedestrian phases and minimum clearance times shall be accommodated for all potential
pedestrian crossings.
(7) Where applicable the minimum green time per phase shall be equal to or greater than the
minimum pedestrian clearance time.
(C) Queuing analysis shall be conducted for all controlled movements in the study area. Queuing
analysis should report 95th percentile queues for all scenarios and periods examined, and identify
any conflicts between adjacent queues and/or queues and permitted turning movements.

(D) Turn lane analysis shall be conducted for all Unsignalized Access Points to the proposed
development. This analysis shall determine if a right or left-turn lane is warranted at a location to
improve operations or safety and shall identify the proper length of turn lane to accommodate any
storage or deceleration requirements. Turn lane analysis shall be conducted in accordance with
KYTC design and permit standards.
(E) Signal warrant analysis shall be conducted for all existing and proposed traffic signals providing
access to the development. Signal warrant analysis shall also be required before any existing
traffic signal is removed. Signal warrant analysis shall be conducted in accordance with most
recent version of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
(F) When a TIS is required under the conditions of Subsection 7.2-3, corridor level analysis shall also
be provided. Corridor analysis shall estimate average travel speed along each contiguous Street or
Street(s) in the study area, and shall include all controlled Access Points in the study area defined
in Subsection 7.2-3. Corridor analysis shall be conducted using the latest version of Synchro
software.
7.4-6 Safety Analysis
When the study area includes a corridor or intersection which has been identified as a high accident
location by KYTC, OKI, Staff, or the applicable Legislative Body, safety analysis shall be conducted and
included in the TIS. Safety analysis shall be conducted using the three most recent years of crash data
available. Engineering judgment shall be used when reviewing and analyzing existing crash patterns in
areas where Improvements have been implemented within the period of the crash data. At a minimum
safety analysis shall include but is not limited to:
(A) Determination of crash rates for the subject location;
(B) Statistical analysis of crash data by time, light conditions, day of week, pavement conditions, crash
type, and contributing factors;
(C) Development of crash diagrams based on crash reports. This shall also include analysis of the
Street environment to identify factors which may contribute to significant recurring crashes at the
location; and
(D) Identification and analysis of potential impacts associated with site traffic and/or the proposed
access plan on the existing crash patterns.
Section 7.5: Mitigation
7.5-1 When a proposed development and/or access plan is shown to result in an unacceptable LOS, or reduce
the LOS of adjacent Access Points, intersections or corridors, as defined in Subsection 7.5-3: Operational
Thresholds, the Applicant shall identify the extent of mitigation Improvements necessary to offset the
impact of the development.
7.5-2 Mitigation Improvements may include, but are not limited to, modification to signal systems,
construction of turn lanes or Medians, access Streets, shared Access Drives, etc. When mitigation
Improvements are proposed analysis shall be conducted for the “Build” condition for the year of opening
and the design year with the proposed Improvements. This analysis shall be consistent with and in
addition to the “No Build” and “Build” analysis required in Section 7.4: Study Requirements.

REPORT TO THE KENTON COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION
FROM THE KENTON COUNTY STREET STANDARDS ENGINEERS COMMITTEE (SSEC)
Members: Mark Brueggemann, P.E.; Joe Kramer, P.E.; Jim Viox, P.E.; Ted Vogelpohl, P.E.;
Henry Fischer, Chairman
BACKGROUND
In 2008 the Kenton County Planning Commission (KCPC) initiated an effort to update the Kenton County
Subdivision Regulations. As a part of the update process, input was solicited from various interested groups in
Kenton County. Among those responding, the Kenton County Mayors’ Group, the Kenton County Judge
Executive, the Land Development Council of the Home Builders Association of Northern Kentucky (HBANKY),
and the Northern Kentucky Society of Professional Engineers (NKSPE) were particularly active in their response.
By mid-2013, there was consensus agreement among the interested groups and the KCPC staff on most parts of the
updated draft regulations. The area where there remained substantial disagreement among the parties mentioned
above was that part of the regulation draft that dealt with requirements for future subdivision street pavements.
During the late stages of this community discussion, at the suggestion of the Kenton County Judge Executive and
several city Mayors, and authorization of the Planning Commission Chairman, a committee of five local pavement
professionals with over 150 years of collective experience in the design, construction, reconstruction, and
maintenance of subdivision pavements was formed and took on the name of Kenton County Street Standards
Engineers Committee (SSEC). The committee members are listed above. This committee was asked, as a
voluntary community service, to do the following: analyze existing subdivision pavement performance, evaluate
that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance, and make recommendations that
would improve pavement customer value in future subdivision pavements. All earlier community discussion on
pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process.
The committee established a problem analysis and decision making approach with the objective of providing
Kenton County subdivision pavement customers (home purchaser/owner, home occupant, taxpayer, citizen)
maximized long-term pavement value. Over the course of a year, the committee met for two hour meetings,
normally twice weekly, to generate their analysis and recommendations. In addition, there were meetings and
conversations with many other individuals and groups seeking their advice, input, and consensus agreement. Those
groups included:
• The Kenton County Planning Commission Subdivision Regulations Committee
• Kenton County Planning Commission
• Kenton County Mayors’ Group Subdivision Regulation Review Committee
• Various Northern Kentucky city and county engineers
• Various Northern Kentucky city and county public works officials
• Brian Wood, P.E. – Executive Director of Plantmix Asphalt Industry of Kentucky
• Local concrete and asphalt producers
• Local subdivision improvement contractors
• The Northern Kentucky Society of Professional Engineers continuing education session (Feb. 24, 2014)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN
THE KENTON COUNTY SUBDIVISION REGULATION STREET STANDARDS
The following represents the consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in Kenton
County subdivision street regulations by the SSEC. Besides many hours of analysis and discussion by our
Committee, input into the analysis and decision making process was solicited, received, and considered from a
broad spectrum of those involved in the design, construction and maintenance of subdivision streets, especially
those who have been involved in the KCPC subdivision regulation update process. In addition, many sources from
the professional pavement design and maintenance literature were considered and used.
It is noteworthy that the recommendations contained in this report are the unanimous recommendations of the
members of the SSEC.
The SSEC hereby respectfully requests that the KCPC accept the following analysis and incorporate these
recommendations into the revised Subdivision Regulation street standards now under their consideration.
PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
Realistic problem solving requires accurate definition of the problems and their root causes. That is the aim of the
following as it relates to problems in existing Kenton County subdivision pavements and improvements for the
design and regulation of future pavements.
The following is a list of the most critical problems and opportunities for improvement that have been identified in
Kenton County subdivision pavements installed from roughly 1985 (28 years old) to 2000 (13 years old). The
significance of 1985 is that, in 1985, there was a substantial effort by the Northern Kentucky engineering,
homebuilding, and local government community to improve new subdivision pavement performance. This 1985
effort resulted in a substantial upgrade and standardization of subdivision pavement regulations across Northern
Kentucky, including Kenton County. The subdivision pavements built from 1985 to 2000 in Kenton County were
built under those 1985 regulations. There was little to no change in the pavement regulations during that period.
Jim Viox, Henry Fischer, and Thelen Associates, Inc. (George Thelen then and Ted Vogelpohl now) have been
participants in both the 1985 update effort and this current update effort. This continuity has benefitted this current
effort greatly. It is also noteworthy that very significant improvements in pavement performance and citizen/
homeowner/ taxpayer pavement value resulted from that 1985 effort. Hopefully, as much or more value can be
gained from this current effort.
PROBLEMS COMMON TO ASPHALT AND CONCRETE PAVEMENT
1. Pavement performance standards are not clear in the current regulations. Pavement design parameters,
performance expectations, and procedures for and the importance of proper pavement maintenance are not
set out. This has often resulted in unclear and unrealistic expectations for pavement performance and
maintenance within the Kenton County community.
2. Quality assurance efforts in pavement construction in some cases have been lacking, leading to premature
pavement failure. Related to this problem is the fact that some construction and material specifications in
the current subdivision regulations are inadequate to insure quality pavement performance. In other
instances, the existing regulations don’t provide an adequate description of material and construction
specification tolerances that can be achieved using good material control and construction practices. This
lack of proper tolerances leads to ambiguity, confusion, and arbitrary decision making during construction
on what the acceptable material and construction standards are. Various aspects of this quality assurance
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 201
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
effort are the responsibility of the developers, the design and geotechnical engineers, the construction
contractor, and the KCPC and its designated inspection agency.
3. In many cases, subdivision streets in Kenton County communities have not been adequately maintained by
their owners, thus shortening pavement life and substantially increasing ultimate customer long-term
pavement costs.
4. There is no consideration given in existing regulations pavement design of how to extend pavement life
beyond the 20 year design life.
5. Subgrade strength is, in some cases, being degraded because of water penetrating into and weakening the
subgrade. There is a need for improvement in the drainage characteristics of subdivision pavements (both
surface and subsurface); there are design shortfalls as well as construction quality control and maintenance
shortfalls. This problem is much more critical in asphalt pavements because of asphalt’s high reliance on
subgrade strength as compared to concrete’s reliance on uniform subgrade support.
6. Pavement failures caused by utility ditch settlement under the street. This is a more costly per occurrence
but less frequent problem for concrete pavements.
7. Existing subdivision regulation standards for streets in industrial and commercial subdivisions are often
inadequate for the heavy truck traffic loading these streets must support.
PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO ASPHALT STREET PAVEMENTS
8. When asphalt pavements came into common use in Kenton County in the early 1990’s, there was a failure
to recognize and address the fact that asphalt pavements are more dependent on subgrade strength than
concrete pavements. Often there was an assumption that subgrade strength that was good enough for
concrete was good enough for asphalt. This isn’t true. This assumption led to some asphalt pavement
failures caused by inadequate subgrade preparation and/or inadequate subgrade materials.
9. Asphalt pavement subgrade weakening caused by inadequate pavement surface and subsurface storm water
management. Root causes include inadequate subgrade and surface cross slope, both in design and
inadequate quality control; water penetrating the asphalt/curb apron interface due to the asphalt being
finished below the curb apron; inadequate curb apron cross slope to the gutter line; the asphalt subgrade
being cut lower than the adjacent curb subgrade, thus trapping water under the asphalt; water penetrating
the subgrade from the area outside the curb; and inadequate sealing and maintenance of the asphalt/curb
apron interface. Another problem in this area relates to the improper use of more brittle asphalt materials
designed specifically for highway use. When more brittle asphalt materials are used in subdivision
pavements, premature surface cracks develop in the body of the pavement, allowing water to penetrate
through the pavement into the subgrade and accelerating deterioration of the pavement subgrade.
10. There are inadequate quality assurance requirements in the current regulations for asphalt material and no
asphalt in-place density requirements or testing.
11. In some limited cases, there have been excessive premature asphalt street concrete curb and gutter failures.
Some causes include: improper or inadequate isolation joints at structures (catch basins); inadequate curb
cross section bending strength and/or inadequate subgrade support; and inadequate concrete material
quality leading to D-cracking and other freeze-thaw concrete deterioration.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 202
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO CONCRETE STREET PAVEMENTS
12. Premature pavement failures caused by in-place concrete not being resistant enough to natural multi-year
freeze-thaw and expansion/contraction cycles. Causes include:
a) Concrete mixes (coarse aggregate type and cement content) that are not resistant enough to concrete Dcracking
and the use of appropriate de-icers. Note that some inappropriate de-icers will cause concrete
deterioration even with appropriate concrete mixes. The D-cracking problem leads to deterioration at
the joints as well as total concrete failure in the body of the concrete slabs.
b) Excessive concrete street lengthening or “growth” problems that are caused by the use of expansion
joints in the pavement, expansive gravel 57’s coarse aggregate, premature load transfer failures at
contraction joints, joint seal failure and poor maintenance. Another pavement condition that can
contribute to the problem is where pavement lengthening is relatively unrestricted, such as at the end of
downhill cul-de-sacs. Measures to manage potential pavement growth impacts on private property
outside of the pavement can also be improved.
13. Premature contraction joint load transfer failure which causes rough vehicle ride and eventual slab failure.
This problem is caused by the separation of the contraction joints due to the use of expansion joints and
more recently (since 1990) by the use of substantial amounts of #8 gravel in pavement concrete mixes. The
addition of #8 gravel and corresponding reduction in 57’s gravel decreases the percentage of total aggregate
above ½” in size, and thus decreases the aggregate interlock across the contraction joint. Inadequate joint
seal maintenance is another contributing factor to this problem. This type failure also contributes
significantly to concrete problems described in number 12 above.
RECOMMENDATION OBJECTIVE
The most serious and improvable existing subdivision pavement problems have been identified along with their
root causes. The objective now is to find solutions to those problems that yield the pavement customer (house
purchaser, home owner, occupant, taxpayer, citizen) the lowest possible 50 year net present value for the pavement
life cycle costs. Net present value accounts for the time value of money, which is the basis for evaluating any
pavement option. Initial construction costs, pavement joint maintenance, localized failure repair, and resurfacing
costs are the primary life cycle costs. 50 years was selected as the reasonable period to evaluate pavement use,
performance, and maintenance. It is anticipated that the life of most subdivision pavements as designed here can be
extended beyond 50 years when properly constructed and maintained with additional refurbishment and repair
some time after 50 years.
The following Committee recommendations are consistent with this preceding objective. Note that local suburban
subdivision streets, which represent the bulk of subdivision streets built in Kenton County, are used as examples in
many of these recommendations and exhibits. These recommendations are easily adapted to other classes of
subdivision streets.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. For all engineering, material, and construction specifications in the subdivision regulations, including those
recommended herein, establish realistically achievable definitions, including allowable variances and
tolerances.
Benefit: Meeting this objective will substantially help clarification of pavement expectations for all
involved in the subdivision process. It will also help minimize ambiguity and arbitrary decision making on
as-constructed pavement variances in the future.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 203
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
2. Include a Pavement Performance and Design section in the subdivision regulations that sets out a 20-year
design life and 50-year life cycle maintenance and resurfacing plan. Also include other subdivision
regulation pavement design parameters, the proper expectations for pavement performance, the differences
in performance characteristics between asphalt and concrete, the need for maintenance, and other related
subjects. Figure C.1-A:Exhibit A contains the SSEC parameter selection and example design calculations
for subdivision pavements. Exhibit B contains the SSEC 50-year life cycle expected minimum
maintenance requirements.
Benefit: Addresses problem #1 and helps address problems #3 and #4.
3. After revised regulations are adopted, establish an effort whereby a group of local engineers, contractors,
developers and governmental officials collaborate to improve the governmental pavement construction
inspection program. The focus should be to determine those factors or items that are most important to be
inspected to insure proper pavement performance. Then once those factors are determined, train inspection
personnel how to inspect those factors and document those inspections. The formation of a longer term
inspection oversight group should also be considered.
Benefit: Addresses problem #2.
4. Suggest to the Kenton County Mayors’ Group that a pavement management system such as the one used
currently by the City of Florence would be a good idea for implementation in Kenton County. Properly
implemented, this type of system will significantly improve long-term customer pavement value.
Benefit: Helps solve problem #3.
5. Adopt a structural subgrade strength minimum for the standard subdivision pavement design of CBR = 2 or
greater for concrete and CBR = 3 or greater for asphalt. Require site specific improvements in design and
construction of the subgrade and/or pavement by a Registered Engineer where these CBR requirements
can’t be met with the proposed subdivision’s natural soils and proper compaction.
Benefit: Help address problems 5 and 8.
6. Adopt a requirement for geotechnical reports regarding pavement design and subgrade support at multiple
stages of subdivision approval, as described in Exhibit C. These reports will also address other important
soil slope stability and structural issues.
Benefit: Assures adequate subgrade structural support for pavements. Helps address problems 5 and 8.
7. Establish minimum subdivision regulation pavement design for industrial and commercial subdivisions
with stated design parameters, including ESAL loading. Require planned traffic (ESAL) loading analysis
by a registered engineer for all commercial and industrial subdivisions. Where planned traffic loading
exceeds standard design loading or where minimum required CBR’s are not met, require the necessary
improvements in pavement design and construction. See Exhibit A for proposed industrial/commercial
pavement designs.
Benefit: Solves problem #7.
8. Increase subgrade cross slope from the current 2%. Use a subgrade cross slope of 3% for concrete and
4.5%+ for asphalt pavements (see Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit F).
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
9. Increase finish surface cross slope of all pavements from 2% to 3% (see Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit
F).
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
10. Use concrete sloped curb (see Exhibit E) and eliminate use of current concrete rolled curb.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 204
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
Benefit: Helps solve problems 4 and 11 and improves vehicle ride when accessing driveways.
11. Use ODOT 6” chair back curb or equivalent instead of KTC 6” vertical curb. Allow horizontally sawed
driveway apron cuts in this curb type.
Benefit: The ODOT curb is more approachable when parking a car adjacent to the curb and less likely to
damage wheel rims.
12. Require that the front top edge of the sidewalk along the street be constructed 6” +1” above the top of
sloped curb (see Exhibit G).
Benefit: Help solve problem #4 by allowing for future significant asphalt overlays while still maintaining
adequate street drainage (see Exhibit H).
13. Require edge drains along all curb lines as depicted in Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit F.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
14. Require that telephone and electric crossovers under the street and three feet beyond the street to be
installed as follows: Separate the parallel ducts by at least 2” horizontally using spacers; cover with 6” of
fill sand; properly compact with a vibratory plate compactor; add additional conduit as necessary, properly
separated. Cover with fill sand properly compacted. Backfill remaining trench with KTC dense grade
aggregate (DGA) properly compacted up to subgrade (see Exhibit G). Other shallow utility ditches under
the pavement, other than those described in 15 below, are to be similarly bedded, covered, and backfilled.
Benefit: Helps solve problem #6.
15. Require storm catch basins and catch basin storm crossovers to be bedded, covered, backfilled, and drained
into one catch basin as depicted on Exhibit H. Make sure 57’s crushed stone is exposed to the base of the
pavement. Properly compact all materials.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5, 6 and 9.
16. Adopt subdivision street classifications, including number of lots served, street width, subgrade slope,
pavement thicknesses, and curb type, as shown in Exhibit I.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 1, 4, 5 and 9.
17. Adopt the standard of always having the pavement base course, whether stone-based or full-depth asphalt,
extend under the curb as shown in Exhibit D and Exhibit E.
Benefit: Allows for the required use of a 24-inch wide curb instead of the current standard 30-inch wide
curb and helps solve problems 5, 9 and 11.
18. Adopt asphalt material standards which more narrowly define those KTC asphalt material standards which
are appropriate for residential subdivision pavements. Set out testing requirements for asphalt aggregate
and liquid asphalt content. Also establish density testing requirements for in-place pavement. Use KTC
crushed stone base material for stone-based pavements. Require regular reporting and passing results of
KTC gradation requirement from base material sources.
Benefit: Helps solve problems #2 and #10.
19. For asphalt pavements, increase the cross slope of the apron of the 24” concrete curb and gutter section to
6% (see Exhibit D and Exhibit E). Require the asphalt surface at the apron to be finished 1/4” + 1/8” above
the apron and properly sealed.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
20. Install finish course of asphalt no later than one year from the date of installation of the asphalt base and
intermediate course (see Exhibit D and Exhibit E). When the finish course of asphalt is installed
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 205
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
immediately as a part of initial construction, asphalt base material may be substituted for intermediate base
material.
Benefit: Insures that asphalt streets are completed on a timely basis.
21. Specify concrete mixes used for concrete pavements to have six bags of cement per cubic yard. Require all
large aggregates (above #8’s) to be crushed limestone. Require that #4 limestone be included in the
pavement mix. A maximum aggregate size of 57’s is appropriate for concrete curb and gutter. Require
KTC approval of hardness requirements for crushed limestone aggregate sources. See Exhibit J for SECC
recommended concrete aggregate content and a discussion of the importance of large aggregate size in
concrete pavement.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 12 and 13.
22. Eliminate expansion joints in concrete pavements. Use skewed contraction joints as shown in Exhibit K.
Place contraction joints at a maximum spacing of 15’ O.C.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 12 and 13.
23. For concrete pavements, provide 3” of expansion joint material in the driveway apron area within the right
of way (see Exhibit L) to provide for the management of any concrete pavement growth that does occur.
Inspect placement when inspecting driveway apron/sidewalk construction. City/County street maintenance
personnel will monitor any closing of expansion joints, as a part of normal street maintenance, and take
appropriate action.
Benefit: Provides for management of street growth problems outside of the pavement, when they do occur
(problem #12.b).
24. Use pavement lugs in concrete pavement as shown in Exhibit M to help minimize potential pavement
growth in critical pavement geometric conditions. These critical conditions, which are identified in Exhibit
N and Exhibit O, have historically been the pavement geometric conditions where subdivision pavement
growth problems have been more likely to occur.
Benefit: This should help mitigate the problem described in problem #12.b.
25. The KCPC should consider the merits of replacing the current cul-de-sac design with the Hamilton County
teardrop cul-de-sac design (see Exhibit P).
Benefit: This teardrop design might make turn around for public service vehicles easier than the current
design.
The preceding represents our group consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in
future Kenton County subdivision pavements.
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS
As a part of the SECC’s work, they solicited and received the cooperation from three local developers (Arlinghaus,
Drees, and Fischer), several local governmental entities, local construction contractors, and material suppliers in the
construction of several pavement demonstration projects. These demonstration projects were built in 12 different
new subdivision sections throughout Northern Kentucky during the period of September 2012 through July 2014.
The purpose of these demonstration projects was to evaluate the constructability, ease of quality control, cost,
and—to the extent possible—probable long-term performance characteristics of various material specifications,
construction methods, and construction details. Included among the tested alternatives were many of the final
recommendations of this report which have been suggested for adoption in the Revised Subdivision Regulations for
Kenton County. There were also alternatives tested that were not used in the SECC’s final recommendations.
These demonstration projects greatly enhanced the confidence of the SSEC in their final recommendations.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 206
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
Among the final SSEC recommendations contained in this report that were tested in these demonstration projects
were critical parts of recommendations number 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
CONCLUSION
The recommendations for improvement are in the areas of design, construction standards, construction quality
control, and maintenance of pavements, which are interdependent and all necessary to insure good
homeowner/taxpayer pavement value. The SECC also recognizes that proper pavement performance expectation
setting for all involved in the regulation, design, construction, and maintenance of subdivision pavements is a
critical component of obtaining good pavement value. Hopefully, our work here will help improve communication
in this regard.
Our work on problem definition and recommendations is now complete. We now respectfully ask the Commission
to accept our work product and have your staff help us incorporate this work product into the current Kenton
County draft subdivision regulations which will be considered for adoption by the KCPC at public hearing.
Thank you for your consideration.

After this report was submitted to the Kenton County Planning Commission in draft form, the Commission
Chairman asked this Committee to work with the KCPC Staff to integrate these recommendations into the KCPC
draft subdivision regulations for consideration of adoption by the Planning Commission. This Committee did so, as
requested.

Design Life: The service or performance period before a new
pavement requires rehabilitation, or the time during which
a new pavement deteriorates from its initial serviceability
to its terminal serviceability. Selected as 20 years.
Life Cycle Analysis: The extended pavement service or analysis period
including maintenance, resurfacing and rehabilitation
beyond the Design Life. Selected as 50 years.
Drainage Coefficient: Selected as 1.0 based on poor quality of drainage and
pavement structure being exposed to moisture levels
approaching saturation up to 5 percent of the time.
Reliability: Factor that incorporates some degree of certainty that the

cycle. Selected 80 percent.
Deviation: Standard deviation that accounts for reliability of AASHTO
Road Test data for local conditions. Selected 0.35 for
concrete pavement and 0.45 for asphalt pavement.
Initial Serviceability: Serviceability is described as the ability of a pavement to
serve its intended traffic. The AASHTO serviceability
scale is 0 to 5, with 5 being a flawless pavement and 0
being a pavement that is impossible to travel. Initial
serviceability is a function of pavement type and
construction quality. Selected 4.2 for concrete and 4.5 for
asphalt.
Terminal Serviceability: The lowest serviceability that will be tolerated before
rehabilitation. Selected 2.5 for concrete and asphalt

(minimum) for concrete pavements and 3 (minimum) for
asphalt pavements. Selected a modulus of subgrade
reaction (K) of 50 pci to correlate with CBR = 2 for
concrete pavements. Selected a resilient modulus (MR)
of 2,700 psi to correlate with a CBR = 3 for asphalt
pavements, which accounts for seasonal environmental
and climatic factors, roadbed soil quality and roadbed soil
moisture and freeze-thaw conditions.

Commercial/Industrial Street
Reviewed several existing Northern Kentucky commercial/industrial subdivisions to
evaluate truck traffic. Selected 3,500,000 ESAL for 20-year design life as base value
for commercial/industrial pavements. Each project to have documentation of projectspecific
ESAL. If project-specific ESAL greater than 3,500,000, then a project-specific
design is required.

Year 34 to Year 50 ESAL:
For residential streets, 85% (17/20) of average 20-year
post-construction ESAL, without site development work
and house construction traffic. For commercial/industrial,
85% of 20-year ESAL.

Concrete Commercial/Industrial Street Example:
Using applicable parameters from Table 4.4-1, the calculated doweled concrete
pavement thickness for 3,500,000 ESAL (20-year Design Life) is 9 inches. For a
50-year Life Cycle, the total ESAL are:

20 Years
ESAL 50 Years 50 = 



= 
Increasing the doweled concrete pavement thickness to 10 inches yields a
calculated ESAL = 8,982,500, which is greater than ESAL50 (8,750,000).
After the asphalt and concrete pavement thickness adjustments for 50-year Life Cycle
considerations are made, the calculated thicknesses in Table 4 become the required
thicknesses in Table 4.4-2.

4 6-8 inch KYTC crushed stone base for residential pavements to be installed in one lift (pug milled) and properly compacted (one
lift). Any crushed stone base greater in thickness than the above noted 6-8 inches must be installed in two lifts. Asphalt base can
be replaced with a structurally equivalent thickness of crushed stone base as long as the following minimum asphalt thicknesses are
maintained: minimum total Asphalt thickness equals 4.5 inches local, 5.5 inches subcollector, 6.5 inches residential collector, and
7.5 inches commercial/industrial
5 Number of lots served for a particular Street is defined as the number of lots which that Street serves as the sole access or, where
a number of Lots are served by more than one access, it is an approximation of the number of lots served that is equivalent to one
access.
- Example 1: A particular section Street serves as the sole access to less than 200 Lots. That Street would then be a
Local Street.
- Example 2: An area of existing and future residential development of 450 Lots is served by more than one access Street.
Only those Streets that will carry traffic and ESAL loading higher than a Subdivision Street that provides sole access to
more than 200 Lots will be classified as a subcollector Street.

ALTERNATE PAVEMENT DESIGNS
The above calculations are based upon a CBR of 2 for concrete pavements and a CBR
of 3 for asphalt pavements, per Table 4.4-1. The following Table 5 presents the
Structural Numbers for Alternate Asphalt Pavement Designs for CBR values ranging
from 2 to 7, for use in Alternate Designs when the documented CBR value is not 3.
Design for CBR values less than 2 is not recommended; rather, the subgrade soils
should be improved to CBR = 2 or greater. The Structural Numbers in Table 5 include
the adjustment for the 50-year Life Cycle consideration.

The thicknesses in Table 6 illustrate that there is very little variation in calculated
pavement thicknesses with changes in CBR. For all street classifications, there is only
0.53” to 0.67” variation in concrete thickness when the CBR changes from 2 to 7.
Therefore, it is recommended that all alternative concrete pavement designs use the
same required thicknesses as the base or standard designs. The required thicknesses
for each street classification, adjusted for 50-year Life Cycle considerations, are given in
Table 7.

EXHIBIT C
SUBGRADE QUALITY VERIFICATION
A qualified geotechnical engineer will provide the verification of the site specific subgrade support. The City of
Cincinnati’s list of qualified geotechnical engineers will be used as the base “approved” list for geotechnical
engineers with the ability of KCPC to add to or delete from that list. The following steps will be taken:
a. At the preliminary subdivision plan stage, the geotechnical engineer will use his local soils
knowledge, USGS soils mapping, and a visual field reconnaissance to report on the likelihood of soils
on that specific site meeting the minimum CBR values for subgrade. The report will also include
observations relative to the site’s suitability for building support.
b. At construction drawing submittal, the geotechnical engineer will submit a report on the soil types,
the expected CBR of those soil types that exist on that section of lots being submitted (or possibly
on the subdivision as a whole). This submittal will also include information on other issues of
structural subsurface stability for proposed subdivision public land improvements planned for the
site. These judgments will be based on the results of soil borings, open trench exploration, soil
testing, etc. that are sufficient for the geotechnical engineer to render his engineering opinion.
c. During mass earthwork, subgrade materials will be evaluated as to their meeting required densities
and as to the subgrade materials being used being capable of producing the CBR required to meet
the base subdivision street design when compacted to the required densities. Reports as to these
results will be submitted by the geotechnical engineer to the KCPC prior to the installation of
pavement. If subgrade soils are substandard, remedial subgrade/pavement enhancement will be
designed and submitted to KCPC.
d. Prior to pavement being installed, the subgrade will be tested for density, moisture content, proof
rolled, inspected for uniformity and proper subgrade profile according to approved procedures of
the KCPC by properly qualified and supervised inspectors.

There are numerous issues to consider in the selection of aggregate type and distribution in concrete
mixes. In un-reinforced concrete pavement with non-doweled contraction joints (all Kenton County Sub
Reg pavements except commercial/industrial), having a relatively high percentage of large, angular
aggregate supports good long-term contraction joint performance. The comparative measure of
aggregate size distribution used for concrete is the percentage retained on various size sieves.
The following table compares aggregate distribution for typical pavement mixes used in Northern
Kentucky in the 1980’s and earlier, the mid 1990’s through today, and the SSEC recommended
pavement aggregate mix.

GENERAL RULES OF TOOLED CONTRACTION
JOINT LAYOUT
1.) Skew joints 2' in each 12.5' lane; 2'-4" skew in each 14' lane.
2.) Always have the driver's side front wheel of the vehicle hit the skewed
joint first.
3.) Maximum joint spacing = 15'; adjust joint spacing as necessary to
keep spacing above a 8' minimum.
4.) On horizontal curves, layout joint spacing along centerline at 14' O.C.;
visually determine a radial line from the centerline back to the curb;
measure back (forward) from that point 2' to set the skew, remembering
the driver's side front wheel of the vehicle hits the skewed joint first. Tool
the joint at the skewed line.
5.) At intersections, catch basins and cul-de-sacs, follow joint layout
shown.
