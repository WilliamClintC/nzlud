      (2)   Acts by assistants.  When a statute, code provisions or

well may do as the principal, that requisition shall be satisfied by the

      (3)   Gender; singular and plural; tenses.  Words denoting
the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter
genders; words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the

enumeration of terms is not to be limited to the class enumerated unless
expressly so limited.

§ 31.01  AUDIT OF CITY’S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.

CHAPTER 32: ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND PENALTIES



Section



   32.01   Purpose



   32.02   Administrative offense defined



   32.03   Notice



   32.04   Payment



   32.05   Failure to pay



   32.06   Disposition of funds



   32.07   Offenses and penalties



§ 32.01  PURPOSE.



   Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this chapter
are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost
effective and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain city code provisions. The procedures are intended to be
voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with administrative
offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as
is provided for thereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in
the procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in
accordance with law. Likewise, the city in its discretion may choose not to
initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the
first instance. In the event a party participates in the administrative
offense procedures, but does not pay the monetary penalty before the seven
day deadline, the administrative offense agreement becomes null and void and
the citation will be forwarded to Otter Tail Court Administration to be
processed through the appropriate methods.
(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03)



§ 32.02  ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE DEFINED.



   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:



   ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE.  A violation of a provision of the city
ordinances and is subject to the administrative penalties set forth in the
schedule of offenses and penalties referred to in Resolution No. 53 entitled
"Resolution adopting Administrative Offense Penalties" and any future
resolutions which add to this list.



(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03)



§ 32.03  NOTICE.



   Any officer of the Perham Police Department, the Perham Building
Official or any other person authorized by the City Manager and having
authority to enforce city ordinances shall, upon determining that there has
been a violation, notify the violator or, in the case of a vehicular
violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation. Said notice shall
set forth the nature, date and time of the violation, the name of the
official issuing the notice and the amount of the scheduled penalty.
(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03)



§ 32.04  PAYMENT.



   (A)   Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within
seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on
the schedule of penalties for the violation. The penalty may be paid in
person, or by mail, and payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the
violation.



   (B)   Payment of the administrative penalty shall not relieve the
violator or their obligations or prevent the city from taking such actions as
may be necessary to correct immediate threats to health and safety or abate
nuisances. Any such actions shall be taken in accordance with applicable
ordinances and statutes.



(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03)



§ 32.05  FAILURE TO PAY.



   In the event a party charged with an administrative offense fails to
pay the penalty, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought
against the alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes. If the

not request services but a fire or other situation exists which, at the
discretion of the Fire Department personnel in charge, requires fire service,

must give the property owner notice of its intent to certify the unpaid fire
service charge by September 15.

DISCHARGE OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE



§ 51.015  PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.



   (A)   In cases where, and in the opinion of the approving authority,
the character or the wastewater from any manufacturing or industrial plant
building or other premises is such that it will damage the system or cannot
be treated satisfactorily in the system, the approving authority shall have

it from entering the city system.



   (B)   No person shall discharge any unpolluted industrial water to
the sanitary sewer system without the approval of the approving authority.



   (C)   Except in quantities or concentrations or with provisions as
stipulated herein, it shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, or
individual to discharge waters or wastes to the sanitary sewer containing:



      (1)   Free or emulsified oil and grease exceeding on analysis
an average of 100 parts per million (834 pounds per million gallons) of
either, both, or combinations of free or emulsified oil and grease if, in the
opinion of the approving authority, it appears probable that such wastes:



         (a)   Can deposit grease or oil in the sewer line in
such manner to clog the sewers.



         (b)   Are not amenable to bacterial action and will
therefore pass to the receiving waters without being affected by normal
wastewater treatment processes.

§ 51.017  MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.



   (A)   The water consumption during the billing period, as determined
from the meter records of the Water Department, shall be the valid basis for
computing the wastewater flow, unless actual wastewater flow measurement by a
recording meter of an approved type is required by either the approving
authority or industry. The owner shall install and maintain such device in
proper condition to accurately measure such flow. Upon failure to do so, the
water consumption shall be the basis for determining the applicability of
this subchapter and computing the industrial service charge. When water is
obtained from a privately owned source, a water meter and/or wastewater meter
satisfactory to the approving authority shall be installed and maintained at
the persons expense.



   (B)   When water is contained in a product, is evaporated, or is
discharged in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage, an application
may be made for a reduction in the volume of waste discharged to the public
sewer, provided supporting data satisfactory to the approving authority is
furnished. This data shall include a flow diagram, the destination of the
water supply and/or waste, and supported by submetering data obtained on the
process piping at the expense of the private owner.

wastewater shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s
expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable
to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to
the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the city prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.



   (B)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available by the city to officials of the EPA or MPCA upon
request.

   (A)   The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service of a
user and/or wastewater discharge permit (after informal notice to the
discharger) when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
an eminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons,
to the environment, or to the wastewater disposal system or would cause the
city to violate any condition of its NPDES or state disposal system permit.



   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop the
discharge. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the wastewater disposal system or endangerment to any individuals.
The city shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the slug or accidental discharge and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within
15 days of the date of occurrence.



(Ord. 141, passed 11-6-89)



§ 51.039  REVOCATION OF PERMIT.



   In accordance with the procedures of this chapter, the city may revoke
the permit of any user which fails to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his or her discharge, which fails to
report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics,
which refuses reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring, or for violation of conditions of its permit, this
chapter, or applicable state and federal regulations.



(Ord. 141, passed 11-6-89)



§ 51.040  NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.

this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation,
or requirement contained herein, the city may serve upon such person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the
date of the notice, unless a shorter time frame is necessary due to the
nature of the violation, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall
be submitted to the city by the user.



(Ord. 141, passed 11-6-89)



§ 51.041  COSTS OF DAMAGES.



   Any user violating any of the provisions of this chapter or who has
discharge which causes a deposit, obstruction, damage, or other impairment to
the city’s wastewater disposal system shall become liable to the city for
any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violation or discharge. The city
may add to the user’s charges and fees the costs assessed for any cleaning,
repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Any refusal
to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

allocated to all users. Two options for the debt service charge are presented
in Appendix B.



   (C)   Calculation of unit costs for treatment of flow, BOD, and
TSS.  For purposes of determining the proportionate charges, unit costs for
treatment of flow, BOD, and TSS shall be determined and fixed annually in the
sewer service charge system according to the following procedure. Divide the
OM&R costs attributable to billable flow, BOD, and TSS respectively by the
total annual billable volume and loadings of flow, BOD, and TSS to arrive at
unit costs.

      (1)   Measurement of wastewater volume.  The charges assessed
residential users and those users of other classes discharging normal
domestic strength wastewater shall be established proportionately according
to billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated
as follows:



         (a)   Residential users.  Billable wastewater volume
for residential users shall be calculated on the basis of metered water
usage. The wastewater will be billed monthly based off of actual water usage
for the months of November through April. May through October the wastewater
shall be calculated by an average water usage from the prior November through
April months. The city may require residential users to install water meters
for the purpose of determining billable wastewater volume.



         (b)   Nonresidential users. 



            1.   The billable wastewater volume of
nonresidential users may be determined in the same manner as for residential
users, except that if the city determines that there are significant seasonal
variations in the metered water usage of nonresidential users resulting in a
proportionate increase (or decrease) in wastewater volume, then billable
wastewater volume shall be:



               a.   Calculated on the basis of quarterly
metered water usage as recorded throughout the year, or



               b.   Calculated on the basis of wastewater
flow meters.



            2.   The city may, at its discretion, require
nonresidential users to install such additional water meters or wastewater
flow meters as may be necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.



      (2)   Determination of loadings from metered water usage. 
The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated from the volume of
metered water usage, as determined above, where the billable quantities will
be those attributable to wastewater at a concentration of 250 mg/l BOD and
300 mg/l TSS (normal domestic strength wastewater).



   (B)   Determination of sewer service charges for normal domestic
strength users.  User charges for normal domestic strength users shall be
determined as follows:



      (1)   Calculation of unit costs for treatment of normal
domestic strength wastewater:



            Un = Uf + [(Ubod)(1.560)] + [(Utss)(1.871)]



         Where:      Un      =      Unit cost of
operation, maintenance, and replacement to treat normal domestic strength, in
$/CCf.

               1.560      =      Lbs. of BOD in 1
CCF of normal domestic strength wastewater.



               1.871      =      Lbs. of TSS in 1
CCF of normal domestic strength wastewater.



      (2)   Calculation of sewer service charge for normal domestic
strength wastewater:



            SSC   =   Br + DSC + (Un x Bwv)



         Where:      SSC   =   Sewer service charge



               Br   =   Base rate



               DSC   =   Debt service charge

Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 52.05  CONNECTIONS BEYOND CITY BOUNDARIES.



   Where water mains of the city are in any street or alley adjacent to or
outside the corporate limits of the city, the City Council may issue permits
to the owners or occupants of the properties adjacent or accessible to the
water main to make proper water service pipe connections with the water mains
of the city and to be supplies with water in conformity with the applicable
provisions of this chapter and subject to any contract for the supply of
water between the city and any other city.



Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 52.06  CONNECTION TO SYSTEM REQUIRED; USE OF PRIVATE WELLS.



   (A)   The installation of new private water wells on any property to
which municipal water service is available is prohibited. “Private water
wells” shall mean any well not owned by the City which is drilled or
installed for the purpose of removing water through mechanical or not
mechanical means, excluding water wells drilled for such purposes as
dewatering, groundwater monitoring, heating or cooling, elevator borings, or
environmental bore holes.  For the purposes of this chapter, "available"
shall mean that the property is either contiguous to the city street served
by municipal water or benefits from an easement that enables service from
said city street whereby they could connect to municipal water without
further consent from any other landowner.



   (B)   Private water wells lawfully in existence on March 9, 2015,
and private water wells installed subsequent to March 9, 2015, on properties
to which municipal water service is not available at the time of
installation, may remain in use provided they comply with all applicable
regulations, including but not limited to 42 USC § 300f - 300j-26 and M.S.
§ 144.381 - 144.387, provided private water wells lawfully in existence on
March 9, 2015, shall not be expanded.



   (C)   All new homes or buildings shall connect to the municipal
water system if water is available to the property.  At the time as
municipal water becomes available to existing homes or buildings, a direct
connection shall be made to the municipal system within a period of time as
determined by the City Council.  If the connection is not made pursuant to
this chapter, a charge shall be made in an amount established by § 52.51.



   (D)   Any person owning property upon which there already exists a
private water well and is connected to the municipal water system shall
ensure there is no means of cross-connection between the private water well
and the municipal water supply.  Hose bibs that will enable the
cross-connection of the two systems are prohibited on internal piping of the
private water well system.  Where both private and municipal water systems
are in use, outside hose bibs shall not be installed on both systems.



   (E)   The City may at reasonable times enter upon the property on
which a private water well exists and make such examinations and
investigations as to conditions and sanitation as may be deemed reasonable
and necessary by the City to insure and protect the public health of
municipal water consumers by the control of actual and/or potential
cross-connections. If any person refuses to allow their property to be
inspected, the City reserves the right to seek an administrative search
warrant in order to conduct the examination or investigation. As an
alternative to an examination or investigation by the City, the property
owner may obtain an inspection from a professional well inspector, of the
property owner's choosing and at the property owner's expense, to ascertain
whether there is a prohibited actual and/or potential cross-connection.



   (F)   If an existing private water well is not to be used after the
time a municipal water connection is made, the private water well is to be
sealed in accordance to M.S. Ch. 103I and Minn. Rules, Ch. 4725 within 30
days of the connection being made to the municipal water connection.

§ 52.27  REPAIRS.



   (A)   Determination of need for repairs. Based on the information
supplied by the property owners or available to the city, the city will make
a determination whether a problem exists in the water main which is the
city’s responsibility. If the problem appears to exist in the service line
for which the city has no responsibility, the private owners will be
responsible for correction of the problem.



   (B)   Thawing of water services. The city will not attempt to thaw
water services on request of the resident. If the problem is found within the
service line for which the private owner is responsible, the private owner
will be responsible for thawing the service and correction of the problem.



   (C)   Excavation or repair of water service.



      (1)   The city will arrange for the investigative digging up
and repair of any water service where the problem apparently exists within
the public right-of-way.



      (2)   Unless it is clearly evident, however, that the problem
is the responsibility of the city, the excavation and repair will not be made
until the property owner requests the city in writing to excavate or repair
the service and agrees to pay the cost.



      (3)   The owner further agrees to waive public hearing and be
special assessed the cost of the excavation and repair if the problem is
found to be other than the city’s responsibility. The city will make the
determination for responsibility of the cost of investigation or repair.



      (4)   The matter of whether the dig up is done by city forces
or contracted would depend on the urgency or need of repair and the
availability of city forces to do the work. Recovery by the city for faulty
construction will depend upon the circumstances and the decision of the City
Attorney on the likelihood of recovery.



   (D)   Failure to repair. In case of failure upon the part of any
consumer or owner to repair any leak occurring in his or her service pipe
within 24 hours after verbal or written notice thereof, the water may be

or her bill shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be
represented in person and by counsel or any other person of his or her
choosing and may present orally or in writing his or her complaint and
contentions to the city official in charge of utility billing. This official
shall be authorized to order that the customer’s service not be
discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final determination of
the customer’s complaint.



      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be
entertained; only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered.
In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing
procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time
specified, but in no event until the charges have been due and unpaid for at
least 30 days.



      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue
utility service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be
reinstated only after all bills for service then due have been paid, along
with a turn-on charge as established by the City Council by resolution.



   (C)   Cold weather rule. Pursuant to M.S. § 216B.097, as it may be
amended from time to time, no service of a residential customer shall be
disconnected if the disconnection affects the primary heat source for the
residential unit when the disconnection would occur during the period between
October 15 and April 15, the customer has declared inability to pay on forms
provided by the city, the household income of the customer is less than 185%
of the federal poverty level as documented by the customer to the city, and
the customer’s account is current for the billing period immediately prior

§ 53.01  ESTABLISHMENT.



   Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, the City establishes a Storm Drainage
Utility and authorizes the imposition of just and reasonable charges for the
use and availability of storm drainage facilities. The Storm Drainage Utility
operations shall be a part of the Public Works Department and under the
administration of the City Manager.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.02  FINDING AND DETERMINATION.



   (A)   In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to
promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the City
has constructed, operated and maintained a storm drainage system. This
chapter is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same
purposes.



   (B)   The system, as constructed heretofore, has been financed and
paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes.
It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of
recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, establishing,
enlarging, replacing, repairing maintaining and operating the system through
the imposition of charges as provided in this chapter.



   (C)   In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a
methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering
system costs, the topography of the City and other relevant factors, it is
determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for
some or all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging,
replacing, repairing, maintaining and operating the system on the basis of
the expected storm water runoff from the various parcels of land within the
City during a standard rainfall event.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.03  STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY FUND.



   There is hereby created a Storm Drainage Utility Fund into which all
charges, when collected, and all monies received from the sale of any
facilities or equipment or any by-products shall be placed. Such monies shall
be used first to pay normal, reasonable and current costs of operating and
maintaining the facilities.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.04  RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT FACTOR (REF) DEFINED.



   For the purpose of this chapter, one residential equivalent factor
(REF) is defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff
generated by one acre of a given land use to the average volume of runoff
generated by one acre of typical single family residential land, during a
standard one-year rainfall event.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.05  STORM WATER DRAINAGE CHARGES.



   In determining charges, the City Council shall, by resolution,
establish a basic system rate to be charged monthly against one standardized
drainage unit having an REF of one. The charge to be made against each parcel
of land shall then be determined by multiplying the REF for the parcel's land
use classification times the parcel's drainage unit times the basic system
rate. The REF values for various land uses are as follows:

§ 53.06  STANDARDIZED DRAINAGE UNITS.



   (A)   Classification 1.  For the purpose of calculating storm water
drainage charges, all Classification 1 land use parcels shall be considered
to have one drainage unit per residence (maximum parcel size=1/2 acre).



   (B)   Classification 2.  For the purpose of calculating storm water
drainage charges, all Classification 2 land use parcels shall be considered
to have one drainage unit per residence (parcel size between 1/2 and one
acre).



   (C)   Classification 3.  For the purpose of calculating storm water
drainage charges, all Classification 3 land use parcels shall be considered
to have one drainage unit per business (maximum parcel size=1/2 acre).



   (D)   Classification 4.  For the purpose of calculating storm water
drainage charges, all Classification 4 land use parcels shall be considered
to have one drainage unit per business or apartment building (parcel size
between 1/2 and one acre).



   (E)   Classification 5.  For the purpose of calculating storm water
drainage charges, all Classification 5 land use parcels shall be considered
to have one drainage unit per parcel (parcel size greater than one acre).



   (F)   Classification 6.  For the purpose of calculating storm water
drainage charges, all Classification 6 land use parcels shall be considered
to have one drainage unit for each major industrial facility.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.07  OTHER LAND USES.



   Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified
by the City Manager by assigning them to classes most nearly like the listed
uses, from the standpoint of runoff volume for the standard rainfall event.
An appeal of such classifications from the determination of the City Manager
may be made to the City Council.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.08  ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES.



   The City Council may, by resolution, adopt policies providing for the
adjustment of charges for parcels based upon land use data supplied by
affected property owners which demonstrates a runoff volume for a standard
rainfall event substantially different from the REF being used for such
parcels. Such adjustments for storm water drainage charges shall not be made
retroactively.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.09  EXEMPTIONS.



   Public street rights-of-way, cemeteries, parks, and vacant unimproved
land with ground cover are exempt from storm water drainage charges.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.10  PAYMENT OF CHARGES.



   Statements for storm water drainage charges shall be made a part of the
present utility billing system invoiced through the City Manager's Office on
a monthly basis. All charges shall be subject to established procedures for
determining and collecting customer charges.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.11  LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.



   Each billing for storm water drainage charges which are not paid when
due shall incur a penalty charge, as established for delinquent utility
accounts, for the amount past due.



(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)



§ 53.12  ESTABLISHMENT OF TAX LIEN.



   Any past due storm water drainage charges will be certified to the
County Auditor for collection with real estate taxes against the property
served by the utility established in this chapter for collection as other
taxes are collected in the following year pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subd.
3 and City Code. In addition, the City may have the right to bring a civil
action or take other legal remedies to collect unpaid charges.

   (A)   Timing.  The work to be done under the excavation permit, and
the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
90.52.



   (B)   Patch and restoration.  The permittee shall patch its own
work.  The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the
right-of-way or to restore the right-of-way itself.



      (1)   City restoration.  If the city restores the
right-of-way, the permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of
billing.  If following the restoration, the pavement settles due to the
permittee’s improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city,
within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with having to correct the
defective work.



      (2)   Permitee restoration.  If the permittee restores the
right-of-way itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation
permit post a construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions
of Minn. Rules part 7819.3000, as it may be amended from time to time.



   (C)   Standards.  The permittee shall perform patching and

in patching, or restoration performed by the permittee or its agents.  The
permittee upon notification from the Public Works Supervisor, shall correct
all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by
the Public Works Supervisor.  The work shall be completed within five
calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Public Works Supervisor,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or
unreasonable under § 90.52.

right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the Public Works
Supervisor, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration
required by the Public Works Supervisor, the Public Works Supervisor at its
option may do the work.  In that event the permittee shall pay to the city,

permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its right under the
construction performance bond.

right-of-way restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation
fee as established from time to time by Council resolution, as it may be
amended from time to time.  However, the right-of-way user shall remain
responsible for patching and the degradation fee shall not include the cost
to accomplish these responsibilities.

herein.  Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that
specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working
in that greater area make application for a permit extension and pay any
additional fees required thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit
extension.



   (B)   Limitation on dates.  A right-of-way permit is valid only for
the dates specified in the permit.  No permittee may begin its work before

date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and
receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after
the end date of the previous permit.  This supplementary application must be
submitted before the permit end date.

      (2)   The Public Works Supervisor may issue an order to the
permittee for any work which does not conform to the terms of the permit or
other applicable standards, conditions, or codes.  The order shall state

permit.  Within ten days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall

business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the
rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this
chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.



      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
facility owner affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency.  In any
event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.



   (B)   Non-emergency situations.  Except in an emergency, any person
who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or
excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty
pay double the normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees
required by this code, deposit with the city the fees to correct any damage
to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.

application for a right-of-way permit;

does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
90.55.



   (B)   Written notice of breach.  If the city determines that the
permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city
shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. 
The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation
of the permit.  A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city,
at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to
mitigate and remedy the breach.



   (C)   Response to notice of breach.  Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach.  The permittee’s

acceptable plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonable implement the
approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.



   (D)   Reimbursement of city cost.  If a permit is revoked, the
permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs,
including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable

obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation
or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the
facilities at issue.



   (C)   Limitation of space.  To protect the health, safety, and
welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use,

placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way.  In
making those decisions, the Public Works Supervisor shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the
right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public
interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the

utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, the
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest.

possible and placed as required.  The costs associated therewith will be
billed to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of
billing.  Each facility owner shall be responsible for the cost of repairing
any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damages.  Each

completed, the city may apply for an order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the removal and impoundment of the vehicle and,

vehicle.



§ 91.05  SALE; WAITING PERIODS.



   (A)   Sale after 15 days.  An impounded vehicle is eligible for
disposal or sale under § 91.09, 15 days after notice to the owner, if the
vehicle is determined to be:



      (1)   A junk vehicle, except that it may have a valid, current
registration plate and still be eligible for disposal or sale under this
subdivision; or



      (2)   An abandoned vehicle.



   (B)   Sale after 45 days.  An impounded vehicle is eligible for
disposal or sale under § 91.09, 45 days after notice to the owner, if the
vehicle is determined to be an unauthorized vehicle.



§ 91.06  NOTICE OF TAKING AND SALE.



   (A)   Contents; notice given within five days.  When an impounded
vehicle is taken into custody, the city or impound lot operator taking it
into custody shall give notice of the taking within five days.  The notice
shall:



      (1)   Set forth the date and place of the taking; the year,
make, model and serial number of the impounded motor vehicle if the
information can be reasonably obtained; and the place where the vehicle is
being held;



      (2)   Inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to
reclaim the vehicle under § 91.07; and



      (3)   State that failure of the owner or lienholders to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle and contents within the
appropriate time allowed under § 91.05 shall be deemed a waiver by them of
all right, title and interest in the vehicle and contents and a consent to
the transfer of title to and disposal or sale of the vehicle and contents
pursuant to § 91.09.



   (B)   Notice by mail or publication.  The notice shall be sent by
mail to the registered owner, if any, of an impounded vehicle and to all
readily identifiable lienholders of record.  The Department makes this
information available to impound lot operators for notification purposes. 
If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
address of the registered owner and all lienholders, the notice shall be
published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
motor vehicle was towed from or abandoned.  Published notices may be grouped
together for convenience and economy.



   (C)   Unauthorized vehicles; notice.  If an unauthorized vehicle
remains unclaimed after 30 days from the date the notice was sent under
division (B) of this section, a second notice shall be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner, if any, of the
unauthorized vehicle and to all readily identifiable lienholders of record.



§ 91.07  RIGHT TO RECLAIM.



   (A)   Payment of charges.  The owner or any lienholder of an
impounded vehicle shall have a right to reclaim the vehicle from the city or
impound lot operator taking it into custody upon payment of all towing and

45 days, as applicable under § 91.05, after the date of the notice required
by § 91.06.



   (B)   Lienholders.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to

of a lienholder to foreclose.  For the purposes of this section,
GARAGEKEEPER is an operator of a parking place or establishment, an operator
of a motor vehicle storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for
the servicing, repair or maintenance of motor vehicles.

   (A)   Deficiency claim.  The nonpublic impound lot operator has a
deficiency claim against the registered owner of the vehicle for the
reasonable costs of services provided in the towing, storage and  inspection
of the vehicle minus the proceeds of the sale or auction.  The claim for
storage costs may not exceed the costs of:



      (1)   Twenty-five days storage for a vehicle described in §
91.05(A); and



      (2)   Fifty-five days storage for a vehicle described in §
91.05(B).



   (B)   Implied consent to sale.  A registered owner who fails to
claim the impounded vehicle within the applicable time period allowed under
§ 91.05 is deemed to waive any right to reclaim the vehicle and consents to
the disposal or sale of the vehicle and its contents and transfer of title.



§ 91.09  DISPOSITION BY IMPOUND LOT.



   (A)   Auction or sale.



      (1)   If an abandoned or unauthorized vehicle and contents
taken into custody by the city or any impound lot is not reclaimed under §
91.07, it may be disposed of or sold at auction or sale when eligible
pursuant to §§ 91.06 and 91.07.



      (2)   The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form
prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title
to dispose of the vehicle.  The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to
register the vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and claims of ownership.  Before a vehicle is issued a new
certificate of title, it must receive a motor vehicle safety check.



   (B)   Unsold vehicles.  Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the
city or public impound lots pursuant to division (A) of this section shall be
disposed of in accordance with § 91.10.



   (C)   Sale proceeds; public entities.  From the proceeds of a sale
under this section by the city or public impound lot of an abandoned or
unauthorized motor vehicle, the city shall reimburse itself for the cost of
towing, preserving and storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice
and publication costs incurred in handling the vehicle pursuant to this
chapter.  Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the
owner of the vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days and then shall be
deposited in the treasury of the city.



   (D)   Sale proceeds; nonpublic impound lots.  The operator of a
nonpublic impound lot may retain any proceeds derived from a sale conducted
under the authority of division (A) of this section.  The operator may
retain all proceeds from sale of any personal belongings and contents in the
vehicle that  were not claimed by the owner or the owner’s agent before
the sale, except that any suspected contraband or other items that likely
would be subject to forfeiture in a criminal trial must be turned over to the
appropriate law enforcement agency.



§ 91.10  DISPOSAL AUTHORITY.



   The city may contract with others or may utilize its own equipment and
personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles and abandoned scrap
metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for the collection,
storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned scrap metal.  The
city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the collection and
storage of not more than five abandoned or unauthorized vehicles without
advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.



§ 91.11  CONTRACTS; REIMBURSEMENT BY MPCA.



   (A)   MPCA review and approval.  If the city proposes to enter into
a contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to § 91.10, the MPCA may review the proposed contract
before it is entered into by the city, to determine whether it conforms to
the MPCA’s plan for solid waste management and is in compliance with MPCA
rules.  A contract that does so conform may be approved by the MPCA and
entered into by the city.  Where a contract has been approved, the MPCA may
reimburse the city for the costs incurred under the contract that have not
been reimbursed under § 91.09.  Except as otherwise provided in § 91.10,
the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into without
prior notice to and request for bids from all persons duly licensed by the
MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. § 116.07, as it
may be amended from time to time; does not provide for a full performance
bond; or does not provide for total collection and transportation of
abandoned motor vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a contract
covering solely collection or transportation of abandoned motor vehicles
where the MPCA determines total collection and transportation to be
impracticable and where all other requirements herein have been met and the
unit of government, after proper notice and request for bids, has not
received any bid for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles.



   (B)   The city may perform work.  If the city utilizes its own
equipment and personnel pursuant to its authority under § 91.10, and the use
of the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may be reimbursed
by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not reimbursed under §
91.09.



   (C)   The city required to contract work.  The MPCA may demand that
the city contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other
scrap metal pursuant to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste disposal.  If the
city fails to contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the
Department of Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any
person duly licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.

date, place, and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of
City Council order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing
shall be given as set forth in this section.



      (1)   Notice of violation.  Written notice of violation shall
be served by a peace officer on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail.  If the
premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of
record or occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation
shall be served by posting it on the premises.



      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing.  Written notice of any
City Council hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the
owner of record and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified
or registered mail.  If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is

officer shall notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the
premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. 
The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the
nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be abated.  If the
notice of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the
officer shall report that fact forthwith to the City Council.  Thereafter,
the City Council may, after notice to the owner or occupant and an
opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition identified in the
notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if the nuisance is

injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and notice of
motion for summary enforcement.



   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement.  In cases of
emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the notice and

will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health
safety or welfare, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate
the nuisance.  To proceed with summary enforcement, the officer shall
determine that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in
the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably
endanger public health, safety, or welfare.  The officer shall notify in
writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance
and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and
place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of summary
enforcement.  The City Council shall determine whether or not the condition
identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether
public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in
abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of
this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated.  If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.



   (D)   Immediate abatement.  Nothing in this section shall prevent
the city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any
condition which poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.



Penalty, see § 10.99

to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs.  As soon as
the work has been completed and the cost determined, the City Manager or
other official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. 
Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of
the City Manager.

portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Manager
shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance,

City Council may determine in each case.

of all streets, alley, avenues, lanes, squares, drives, circles, and public
property as may be necessary to insure the public safety or to preserve or
enhance the symmetry and beauty of the public property.  No other planting
may be done without the approval of the Public Works Director.



   (B)   Removal of trees endangering utilities or other improvements.



      (1)   The Public Works Department may remove or cause or order
to be removed any tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition or
which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers, electric power lines,
gas lines, water lines, or other public improvement, or is affected with any
injurious fungus, insect, or other pest.



      (2)   Every tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within
the city shall be pruned so that the branches shall not obstruct the light
from a street lamp or obstruct the view of any street intersection, and so
that there shall be a clear space of at least ten feet above the street or
sidewalk.  Dead, diseased, or dangerous trees or broken or decayed limbs
which endanger the safety of public shall be removed.



   (C)   Trees on private property.



      (1)   The City Council shall have the authority to order the
trimming, and removal of trees, shrubs or plants upon private property when
this action is necessary to ensure public safety or to prevent the spread of
disease or insects to trees, shrubs, or plants located in public property. 
Any tree or shrub situated upon private property, but so situated as to
extend its branches over the improved portion of the public street or highway
easement, shall be so trimmed by the owner of the real property upon which
the same is located, so that there is a clear height of at least ten feet
over the portion of such easement used for pedestrian travel, and such
persons shall remove the dead or diseased branches or stubs of trees which
are or may become hazardous to the public use of such easement.  Any trees
obstructing traffic control signs or devices from the view of pedestrian or
motorist shall be pruned to a height established by the city to insure proper
safety for motorist or pedestrians.



      (2)   All orders to trim, remove, or treat trees, shrubs, or
plants given pursuant to this section, shall be in writing and shall be
served in person or by first class mail upon the owner of the property where

owner of the property not less than 14 days from the date of the mailing to
comply with the order in the time specified.



      (3)   If the required action is not taken by the property
owner within the specified time, the city may cause the trees, shrubs, or

owner, the costs of the trimming, removal, or treatment may be recovered by
the city by special assessment upon the property owner.

department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public
property without authorization from the City Public Works Director. TOPPING
is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three
inches in diameter within the tree's crown, to such a degree so as to remove
the normal canopy and disfigure the tree.  Trees severely damaged by storms
or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or obstructions where
other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this section at
the determination of the City Public Works Director.



(Ord. 344, passed 2-11-13)

cause failure of all or part of the tree which would strike a target.  A
target can be a vehicle, building, or a place where people gather such as a
park bench, picnic table, street, or backyard.



   (B)   The city recognizes the following (but not limited to) as
seven main types of tree defects: deadwood, cracks, weak branch unions,
decay, cankers, root problems, and poor tree architecture.  A tree with
defects is not hazardous, however, unless some portion of it is within
striking distance of a target.  The city will authorize immediate action if:



      (1)   A broken branch or top is lodged in a tree;



      (2)   A tree is dead;



      (3)   A branch is dead and of sufficient size to cause injury
(this will vary with height and size of branch).



   (C)   This section refers to street and park trees, and trees on
private property if the Park Board feels the hazard may cause damage to a
target on public property.

street trees, park trees, or trees on private property, as authorized in this
chapter.

§ 96.99  PENALTY.



   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  In addition thereto, the costs of

TOBACCO IN CITY PARKS



§ 97.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   (A)   The city is committed to providing safe and healthy
environments. Tobacco use is a major cause of preventable disease and death.
Smoking, tobacco use, and exposure to second-hand smoke have been found to
cause heart disease, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory
problems. Electronic delivery devices, more commonly referred to as
electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, closely resemble and purposefully
mimic the act of smoking. They produce a vapor of undetermined and
potentially harmful substances and typically contain nicotine derived from
tobacco, which is a highly addictive substance.  Their use in locations
where smoking is prohibited creates concern and confusion.



   (B)   The city believes the use of tobacco products, including
electronic delivery devices, in its parks is detrimental to the health and
safety of its community.



(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless context indicates or requires a different meaning.



   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Any product containing or delivering
nicotine, lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that
can be used by a person to simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine or
any other substance through inhalation of vapor from the product. The term
includes any such devices, whether they are manufactured, distributed,
marketed or sold as e-cigarettes, e-cigars, e-pipes, or under any other
product name or descriptor.



   PARK PROPERTY. All facilities, parks, trails, open space, and other
property owned, leased, rented, contracted, used, or controlled by the city
for parks and recreational purposes, with  the exception of properties
whereby the city leases such property to other private or nonprofit
organizations.



   SMOKING. Inhaling or exhaling from any lighted or heated cigar,
cigarette, pipe, or any other tobacco or plant product, or inhaling or
exhaling aerosol or vapor from any electronic delivery device. SMOKING shall
include being in possession a lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, pipe, or
any other lighted or heated tobacco or plant product intended for inhalation,
or an electronic delivery device that is turned on or is otherwise activated.



   TOBACCO PRODUCT(S). Any product containing, made, derived from tobacco
that is intended for human consumption, whether chewed, smoked, absorbed,
dissolved, inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means, or any
component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product, including but not limited
to cigarettes, cigars and other smoking tobacco; snuff and other chewing
tobaccos; and any other kinds and forms of tobacco.



(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.03  PROHIBITION.



   The sale and use of tobacco products and electronic delivery devices is
prohibited at all times in or on all park property the city has the authority
to control regardless of location.



(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.04  APPLICABILITY.



   This policy applies to all visitors and users on park property, at all
times. Organizers and attendees at public or private events on park property
are required to abide by this policy. Event organizers are also responsible
for communicating and enforcing this policy.



(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.05  EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   It is not a violation of this policy to use a product that has
been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for sale as a
tobacco cessation product, as a tobacco dependence product, or for other
medical purposes, and is being marketed and sold solely for such an approved
purpose.



   (B)   It is not a violation of this policy for a Native American to
use tobacco on park property as part of a traditional Native American
spiritual or cultural ceremony. Approval from City Council must be requested
and received prior to the ceremony.



(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)



ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICES



§ 97.20  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   Unregulated electronic delivery devices, commonly referred to as
electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, closely resemble and purposefully
mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or
other substances created by heat through an electronic ignition system. 
E-cigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful
substances, which may appear similar to smoke emitted by traditional tobacco
products. Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of
traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and
leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions.



(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.21  DEFINITIONS.



   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all
terms shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of
this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply:



   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Any product containing or delivering
nicotine, lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that
can be used by a person to simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine or
any other substance through inhalation of vapor from the product. The term
includes any such devices, whether they are manufactured, distributed,
marketed or sold as e-cigarettes, e-cigars, e-pipes, or under any other
product name or descriptor.



   USE. The inhaling or exhaling of aerosol or vapor from any electronic
delivery device. USE shall also mean being in possession of an electronic
delivery device that is turned on or otherwise activated.



(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.22  PROHIBITION.



   The use of any electronic delivery device is prohibited anywhere
smoking is prohibited by the Minnesota Clean Indoor Act, as it may be amended
from time to time.



(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.23  OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS.



   This subchapter is intended to complement the Minnesota Clean Indoor
Air Act, M.S. §§ 144.411 through 144.417, as it may be amended from time to
time. Nothing in this subchapter authorizes smoking or the use of an
electronic delivery device in any location that is regulated by other
applicable laws or regulations.



(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)



§ 97.99  VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.



   (A)   A person who violates any provision of §§ 97.01 et seq. is
guilty of a petty misdemeanor. Each day of violation constitutes a separate
offense.



   (B)   (1)   Use Where Prohibited. It is a violation of §§ 97.20
et seq. for any person to use an electronic delivery device in an area where
prohibited by this subchapter, or to use an electronic delivery device in an
area where prohibited by a private policy established by the proprietor or
other person in charge of the area.



      (2)   Proprietors. It is a violation of §§ 97.20 et seq. for
the proprietor, person, or entity that owns, leases, manages, operates, or
otherwise controls the use of an area in which the use of an electronic
delivery device is prohibited under this subchapter to knowingly fail to
comply with the provisions of this subchapter.



      (3)   Penalties. A person who violates any provision of §§
97.20 et seq. is guilty of a petty misdemeanor. Each day of violation
constitutes a separate offense.

   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all
terms shall be given their commonly accepted definitions.  For the purpose
of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   PEDDLER.  A person who goes from house-to-house, door-to-door,
business-to-business, street-to- street, or any other type of place-to-place,
for the purpose of offering for sale, displaying, or exposing for sale, 
selling or attempting to sell, and delivering immediately upon sale, the
goods, wares, products, merchandise, or other personnel property that the
person is carrying or otherwise transporting.  The term PEDDLER shall mean
the same as the term hawker.



   PERSON.  Any natural individual, group, organization, corporation,

corporations, partnerships, and associations, the term shall include each
member, officer, partner, associate, agent, or employee.

she may be carrying or transporting samples, or that may be described in a
catalog or by other means, and for which delivery or performance shall occur
at a later time.  The absence of samples or catalogs shall not remove a
person from the scope of this provision if the actual purpose of the
person’s activity is to obtain or attempt to obtain orders as discussed
above.  The term shall mean the same as the term “canvasser.”



   TRANSIENT MERCHANT.  A person who temporarily sets up business out of
a vehicle, trailer, boxcar, tent, other portable shelter, or empty store
front for the purpose of exposing or displaying for sale, selling or

registered under the laws of Minnesota as set forth in M.S. §§ 309.50

of PEDDLERS, SOLICITORS, and TRANSIENT MERCHANTS.

§ 113.21  CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.

   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may
be amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of
this chapter:



   LIQUOR.  As used in this chapter, without modification by the words,

of a single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is

nudity is prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any
establishment licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the
owners, operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and
the public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely
to lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including
prostitution, sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds
that the prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed
under this chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing
community standards of the city.



   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person
or persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent
material. It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when
the person does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals
covered with a non-transparent material.



   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as
provided by law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any
liquor, wine, or 3.2% malt liquor license or any other license issued under
this chapter or the imposition of a civil penalty under the provisions of §
113.99(C).

   (A)   No license or other fee established by the city shall exceed
any limit established by M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to
time, for a liquor license.



   (B)   The Council may establish from time to time in the ordinance
establishing fees and charges the fee for any of the liquor licenses it is
authorized to issue. The license fee may not exceed the cost of issuing the
license and other costs directly related to the enforcement of the liquor
laws and this chapter. No liquor license fee shall be increased without
providing mailed notice of a hearing on the proposed increase to all affected
licensees at least 30 days before the hearing.



   (C)   The city will pro-rate fees the first year to the first full

§ 113.29  COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.



   The Council, in its sound discretion, may either grant or deny the
application for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license.
The Council may, among other things, consider the proposed site and its
proximity to schools, churches, day cares and other similar facilities in
determining if a license will be issued. No applicant has a right to a
license under this chapter.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)



§ 113.30  APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.



   (A)   Form.  Every application for a license issued under this
chapter shall be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall
state the name of the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to
the applicant’s character, with references as the Council may require, the
type of license applied for, the business in connection with which the
proposed license will operate and its location, the style and manner in which
the applicant intends to conduct the business, a description of the premises,
whether the applicant is owner and operator of the business, how long the
applicant has been in that business at that place, and other information as
the Council may require from time to time. An application for an on-sale
intoxicating liquor license shall be in the form prescribed by the
Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also contain the information required
in this section. The form shall be verified and filed with the city. No
person shall make a false statement in an application.



   (B)   Financial responsibility.  Prior to the issuance of any
license under this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of
financial responsibility as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended
from time to time, with regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may
be amended from time to time. This proof will be filed with the city and the
Commissioner of Public Safety. Any liability  insurance policy filed as
proof of financial responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. §
340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time. Operation of a business
which is required to be licensed by this chapter without having on file with
the city at all times effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause
for revocation of the license.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)



§ 113.31  DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.



   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description
may not include any parking lot or sidewalk.  The building and any
permanently constructed and physically attached deck or patio is recognized
as a part of the compact and contiguous licensed premises.  The area must be
included as part of the licensed premises on the applicant’s liquor license
application in the section that describes the licensed premises and must be
covered by liquor liability insurance.  Storage of alcoholic beverages is
not allowed on the attached deck or patio.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)



§ 113.32  APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL.



   At least 90 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The
decision whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion
of the Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)



§ 113.33  TRANSFER OF LICENSE.



   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the
approval of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is
deemed to be a transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior
Council approval is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to
transfer a license shall be treated the same as an application for a new
license, and all of the provisions of this code applying to applications for
a license shall apply.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)



§ 113.34  INVESTIGATION.



   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an
initial application for a license, on an application for transfer of a
license and, in the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public
interest to do so, on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall
conduct a preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant
or it may contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the
investigation. The applicant shall pay with the application an investigation
fee of $500 which shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the
preliminary investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be
returned to the applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall
be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an
on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine license.



   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the
results of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of
the Council, a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the
Council may either conduct the investigation itself or contract with the
Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee
for this comprehensive background and financial investigation to be paid by
the applicant shall be $500, less any amount paid for the initial
investigation if the investigation is to be conducted within the state, and
$10,000, less any amount paid for the initial investigation, if the
investigation is required outside the state. The unused balance of the fee
shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the application is denied.
The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation and the amount actually
expended on the investigation shall not be refundable in the event the
application is denied. The results of the comprehensive investigation shall
be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an
on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine license.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)



§ 113.35  HEARING AND ISSUANCE.



   The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and
not investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of all new liquor licenses with exception to a 3.2% malt
liquor license. After the investigation and hearing, the Council shall, in
its sound discretion, grant or deny the application. No license shall become
effective until the proof of financial security has been approved by the
Commissioner of Public Safety.



(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)

§ 114.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, and
tobacco related devices, and the sales, possession, and use are violations of
both state and Federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby
accepts and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they
have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of
18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to
begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several
serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all
levels of government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale,
possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices
for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors
against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco,
tobacco products, and tobacco related devices, and to further the official
public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting
to smoke as stated in M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.

§ 116.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, to guard against the inception and
transmission of disease, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations.  The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.  Similarly,
it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market.



   (B)   The City Council further finds that experience from other
cities demonstrates that sexually oriented businesses conducted in private by
members of the same or the opposite sex, and employing personnel with no
specialized training, are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening,
subverting or endangering the health, safety and welfare of members of the
community by being the sites of acts of prostitution, illicit sex, and
occasions of violent crimes, thus requiring close inspection, licensing, and
regulation.

(Ord. 233, passed 1-10-05)



§ 116.09  SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.



   (A)   Suspension.  The city may suspend a license for a period not

within the preceding 12 months.

         (g)   A licensee or operator has knowingly allowed any

contact to occur in or on the licensed premises.  The term “sexual
contact” shall have the meaning as it is defined in M.S. § 609.341, Subd.
11(b), as it may be amended from time to time. This subsection shall not

sexually oriented business license for one year from the date revocation
became effective, provided that, if the conditions of § 116.10 are met, a
provisional license shall be granted pursuant to that section. If, subsequent
to revocation, the city finds that the basis for the revocation has been
corrected or abated, the applicant may be granted a license if at least 90
days have elapsed since the date the revocation became effective.  If the
license was revoked under division (B)(2)(g), an applicant may not be granted
another license until the appropriate number of years required under §

§ 116.10  HEARING; LICENSE DENIAL, SUSPENSION, REVOCATION; APPEAL.



   (A)   Notification.  If the City Manager determines that facts
exist for denial, suspension, or revocation of a license under this chapter,
the City Manager shall notify the applicant or licensee (“respondent”) in
writing of the intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, including the
grounds therefor, by personal delivery or by certified mail.  The
notification shall be directed to the most current business address on file
with the city.  Within five working days of receipt of such notice, the
respondent may provide to the City Manager, in writing, a response that shall
include a statement of reasons why the license or permit should not be
denied, suspended, or revoked.  Within three days of the receipt of
respondent’s written response, the City Manager shall notify respondent in
writing of the hearing date on respondent’s denial, suspension, or
revocation proceeding.



   (B)   Appeal and hearing.

written response, the city shall conduct a hearing on respondent’s appeal
of the City Manager’s decision.  The City Council may appoint a committee
of the Council or an independent hearing officer to hear the matter, report
findings of fact and a recommendation for disposition to the Council. 
Hearings on the appeal shall be open to the public and the licensee or
applicant shall have the right to appear and be represented by legal counsel
and to offer evidence in its behalf.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the
City Council shall make a final decision.  If a response is not received by
the city in the time stated or, if after the hearing, the city finds that
grounds as specified in this chapter exist for denial, suspension, or
revocation, then such denial suspension, or revocation shall become final
five days after the city sends, by certified mail, written notice that the
license has been denied, suspended, or revoked.  Such notice shall include a
statement advising the applicant or licensee of the right to appeal such
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.



      (2)   If the City Council finds that no grounds exist for
denial, suspension, or revocation of a license, then within five days after
the hearing, the City Manager shall withdraw the intent to deny, suspend, or
revoke the license, and shall so notify the respondent in writing by
certified mail of such action and shall contemporaneously issue the license.



   (C)   Judicial review. Any decision of the City Council shall be a
final appealable order and the applicant or licensee (“aggrieved party”)
may seek prompt judicial review of such administrative action in any court of
competent jurisdiction.



   (D)   Stay of decision. The filing of an appeal stays the action and
decision of the City Council requiring, denying, suspending or revoking a
license until 60 days after a final decision by the City Council, to provide
the aggrieved party sufficient time to appeal the City Council’s decision
to a court of competent jurisdiction.  If the aggrieved party appeals the
City Council’s decision within the 60 days provided, the stay shall be
extended until a final judicial decision is rendered in the matter.



   (E)   Provisional license. Upon the filing of any court action to
appeal, challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the city’s enforcement of
the denial, suspension, revocation, or licensure requirement, the city shall
immediately issue the aggrieved party a provisional license.  The
provisional license shall allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of
the sexually oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually
oriented employee, as the case may be, and will expire upon the court’s
entry of a judgment on the aggrieved party’s action to appeal, challenge,
restrain, or otherwise enjoin the city’s enforcement.



   (F)   Additional requirements.  The City Council may condition
denial, suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of a license upon appropriate
terms and conditions.

prescribed period in excess of the amount legally due for that period,
provided that no application for refund shall be considered unless filed
within one year after such tax was paid, or within one year from the filing
of the return, whichever period is the longer. The city shall examine the
claim and make and file written findings whereon denying or allowing the
claim in whole or in part and shall mail notice thereof by registered mail to
such person at the address stated upon the return. If such claim is allowed

fact. Such operator shall file such return or corrected return within ten
days of the receipt of such written notice and pay any lodging tax due
thereon. If such persons shall fail to file such return or corrected return,
the City Manager shall make a return or corrected return for such person from
such knowledge and information as the City Manager can obtain, and assess the
lodging tax due on the basis thereof, which said lodging tax shall be paid
within ten days of the receipt of written notice and demand for such payment.

(Ord. 338, passed 5-14-12)



§ 130.05  SOCIAL HOST LIABILITY.



   (A)   Purpose and findings.  The city intends to discourage
underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the
confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally
responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age
possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event
or gathering supplied the alcohol.  The city finds that:



      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property
where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are
harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health
requiring prevention or abatement.



      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect
underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to
alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic
collisions.



      (3)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used
irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as
those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.

Appendix C which is attached to this chapter.

§ 152.02  PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.



   The City of Perham-Otter Tail County Joint Airport Zoning Board,
created and established by joint action of the City Council of the city of
Perham and the Board of County Commissioners of Otter Tail County and the
Town Boards of Perham and Gorman Townships, pursuant to the provisions and
authority of M.S. § 360.063, as it may be amended from time to time, hereby
finds and declares that:



   (A)   An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of
the Perham Municipal Airport and property or occupants of land in its
vicinity and also, if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of
the area available for the landing, take-off, and maneuvering of aircraft,
thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Perham Municipal Airport
and the public investment therein.



   (B)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Perham Municipal Airport.



   (C)   For the protection of the public health, safety, order,
convenience, prosperity, and general welfare, and for the promotion of the
most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or
establishment of airport hazards.



   (D)   The prevention of these airport hazards should be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police
power without compensation.



   (E)   The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport
hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and
lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political
subdivisions may raise and expend public funds.



(Ord. 195, passed 6-22-95)

PERMITS



§ 152.20  FUTURE USES.



   Except as specifically provided in divisions (A) and (B) of this
section, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure
shall be erected, altered, or otherwise established in any zone hereby
created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted by
the City Manager, hereinafter provided for. Each application for a permit
shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to conform to the regulations herein prescribed.
If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.



   (A)   However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet
of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal
and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a
horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features would extend the height limit prescribed for the respective zone.



   (B)   Nothing contained in this foregoing exception shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration,
or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations
established by this chapter as set forth in §§ 152.35 through 152.42, and
the land use limitations set forth in §§ 152.55 through 152.63.

§ 152.21  EXISTING USES.



   Before any existing use or structure may be replaced, substantially
altered, repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established herein, a permit
must be secured authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No permit
shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport
hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater
hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or
any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is
made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be
granted.



(Ord. 195, passed 6-22-95)



§ 152.22  NONCONFORMING USES ABANDONED OR DESTROYED.



   Whenever the Building Official determines that a nonconforming
structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such
structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate
from the zoning regulations. Whether application is made for a permit under
this section or not, the Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the
abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure, at his or her own
expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner
necessary to conform to the provisions of this chapter. In the event the
owner of the nonconforming structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with
such order for ten days after receipt of written notice of such order, the
Zoning Administrator may, by appropriate legal action, proceed to have the
abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure lowered, removed,
reconstructed, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof against
the land on which the structure is or was located. Unless such an assessment
is paid within 90 days from the service of notice thereof on the owner of the
land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date
the cost and expense is incurred until paid and shall be collected in the
same manner as are general taxes.

of the City Manager made in his or her administration of this chapter may
appeal to the Board of Adjustment. Such appeals may also be made by any

   (B)   All appeals hereunder must be commenced within 30 days of the
City Manager’s decision by filing with the City Manager a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The City Manager shall forthwith transmit to

Board of Adjustment in the matter set forth in M.S. § 360.068, subdivision
2, as it may be amended from time to time.

action appealed from, unless the City Manager certifies to the Board of
Adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason
of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed except by order of the Board of Adjustment on notice to the City
Manager and on due cause shown.



   (D)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for

§ 152.78  JUDICIAL REVIEW.



   Any person aggrieved or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment or any governing body of a city, county, or airport
zoning board, which is of the opinion that a decision of the Board of
Adjustment is illegal may present to the District Court of Otter Tail County
a verified petition setting forth that the decision or action is illegal, in
whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition

the office of the Board of Adjustment. The petitioner must exhaust the
remedies provided in this chapter before availing himself or herself of the
right to petition a court as provided by this section.

§ 152.79  VARIANCES.



   (A)   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, permit the growth of any tree, or use his or her property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the
Board of Adjustment, hereinafter provided for, for a variance from such
regulations. If a person submits an application for a variance by certified
mail to the members of the Board and the Board fails to grant or deny the
variance within four months after the last member receives the application,
the variance shall be deemed to be granted by the Board. When the variance is
granted by reason of the failure of the Board to act on the variance, the
person receiving the variance shall notify the Board and the Commissioner of
Transportation by certified mail that the variance has been granted. The
applicant shall include a copy of the original application for the variance
with this notice to the Commissioner. The variance shall be effective 60 days
after this notice is received by the Commissioner, subject to any action
taken by the Commissioner, pursuant to M.S. § 360.063, subdivision 6.A, as
it may be amended from time to time.



   (B)   Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be
contrary to the public interest, but do substantial justice and be in
accordance with the spirit of this chapter, provided any variance so allowed
may be subject to any reasonable conditions that the Board of Adjustment or
Commissioner may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.



(Ord. 195, passed 6-22-95)



§ 152.80  HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING.



   (A)   Nonconforming uses.  The owner of any nonconforming structure
or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary
by the City Manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity
of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights
shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city.



   (B)   Permits and variances.  Any permit or variance granted by the
City Manager or Board of Adjustment as the case may be may, if such action is
deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable
in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question at his or her own expense to
install, operate, and maintain there such markers and lights as may be
necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.



(Ord. 195, passed 6-22-95)



§ 152.99  PENALTY.



   Every person who shall construct, establish, substantially change,
alter, or repair any existing structure or use, permit the growth of any tree
without having complied with the provisions of this chapter or who, having
been granted a permit or variance under the provisions of this chapter, shall
construct, establish, substantially change, or substantially alter or repair
any existing growth or structure or permit the growth of any tree, except as
permitted by such permit or variance, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, imprisonment for not
more than 90 days, or by both. Each day a violation continues to exist shall
constitute a separate offense. The City Manager may enforce all provisions of
this chapter through such proceedings for injunctive relief and other relief
as may be proper under the laws of M.S. § 360.073, as it may be amended from
time to time, and other applicable law.

SECTION 27. SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO
SPECIFIC PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES.
1. Home Occupations. It is the finding of the City Council that home occupations affect neighborhood character, have a potential to be a nuisance to neighbors, and may negatively affect City services. The purpose of this Section is to regulate home occupations in order to avoid such negative impacts and to ensure the integrity and goals of the residential zoning districts. Standards for home occupations are intended to ensure compatibility with other permitted uses and the character of the residential neighborhood.
(A) No Special Permission Required. When an accessory use is deemed a home occupation as defined in this Chapter, it means that the owner, lessee, or other persons who have a legal right to the use of the dwelling unit also have the vested right to conduct the home occupation in conformance with this subdivision, without securing special permission from the City. This shall not be construed to exempt owners, lessees, or other persons who have a legal right to the use of the dwelling unit from other applicable regulations of the City Code.
(B) Allowed in Residential Zoning Districts. Home occupations are allowed as accessory uses where the principal use of the premises is a dwelling. The accessory use of residential property for a home occupation shall conform to the following standards:
(1) Such home occupation shall be conducted solely by residents of the dwelling.
(2) Such home occupation shall be contained entirely within the dwelling. The use of detached
accessory buildings or private garage, attached or detached, for a home occupation is prohibited.
(3) There shall be no outside storage of materials, goods, supplies, or equipment of any kind related
to the home occupation.
(4) Such occupation shall create no noise, dust, vibration, smell, smoke, glare, electrical
interference, fire hazard, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater or more frequent extent than
what normally occurs in a residential zoning district.
(5) No employees, which do not reside at the premises on which the home occupation is located,
shall report to work at the location of the home occupation or park motor vehicles on the property or
in the vicinity of the home occupation.
(6) No commercial vehicle in excess of nine thousand (9,000) pounds gross weight shall be used in
connection with the home occupation or parked on the property.
(7) One automobile is allowed to be used in connection with a home occupation. Such vehicle shall
be parked on a conforming off-street parking stall located on the property.
(8) No traffic or parking demand shall be generated by such home occupation in greater volumes
than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood.
(9) Only one (1) sign shall be allowed. The sign may display the name of the occupant and/or the
name of the home occupation.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 27
64
The sign shall be non-illuminated and attached flat to an exterior wall of the dwelling or visible through a window of the dwelling, not to exceed four (4) square feet in size.
(10) In no way shall the appearance of the structure be altered or the occupation within the residence
be conducted in a manner which would cause the premises to differ from its residential character
either by the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or the emission of sounds, noises,
or vibrations.
(C) Prohibited Home Occupations. The following uses, by the nature of the investment or operation,
have a pronounced tendency to rapidly increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations. The
following uses, therefore, are not permitted as home occupations: Amended – Ord #303 10/11/2010

SECTION 28. NON-CONFORMITIES.
1. Purposes. This Section regulates and limits the continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established prior to the effective date of this Chapter that do not conform to the regulations of this Chapter applicable in the zoning districts in which such uses, structures, and lots are located.
The zoning districts established by this Chapter are designed to guide the future use of land within the City by encouraging the development or maintenance of desirable residential, business, office, institutional, and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of non-conformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual elimination of such non-conformities is generally desirable.
2. General Scope and Scheme of Regulation. This Section establishes separate restrictions for the following categories of non-conformity:
(A) Nonconforming uses (Subd. 3).
(B) Nonconforming structures (Subd. 4).
(C) Nonconforming lots (Subd. 5).
(D) Nonconforming junkyards (Subd. 6).
(E) Nonconforming parking surfaces (Subd. 7).
The degree of restriction made applicable to each category of non-conformity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with non-conformities of that type. Pursuant to Section 39, provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this Section when practical difficulties or particular hardship exist.
3. Nonconforming Uses. The following restrictions shall apply to nonconforming uses of land.
(A) Authority to Continue. Except with regard to the termination by discontinuance or abandonment of a use as provided for below, any lawfully existing nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions set forth below:
(1) Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of non-bearing walls, non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that this restriction shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of this Section.
(2) Enlargement of Structure. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 28
72
use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
(3) Extension of Use. A lawful existing nonconforming use may be extended or expanded throughout an existing building provided that such extension or expansion does not require that the structure devoted to the nonconforming use be structurally altered or enlarged; and provided further that the extension or expansion of the use shall not be allowed unless the off-street parking and loading spaces required for such extension or expansion are provided in accordance with the requirements of Sections 29 and 30 of this Chapter.
(4) Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
(5) Change in Use.
a. A lawful nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located; provided, however, when such a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use.
b. A lawful nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type or intensity, or to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type, but of less intensity, subject to interpretation by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 42. In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4, the Zoning Administrator shall not approve such change if it will require the violation of the restrictions of this Section. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intense nonconforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a more intense nonconforming use.
(6) Damage or Destruction. Any structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use, if destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value and no
building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged, shall
thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
For any use that is legally existing on the effective date of this Chapter, and is otherwise conforming to this Chapter except that the existing number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for said use is not in compliance with Sections 29 and 30, but said existing parking and loading spaces currently provided for the use were conforming when the use was established, that when said use is thereafter damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause not under the control of the property owner, the requirements of Section 29, Subd. 20, and Section 30, Subd. 12, shall not apply if the use is reconstructed, re-established, or repaired within one (1) year and to the same condition, density, and floor area as existed before being damaged or destroyed.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 28
73
The property owner shall be required to restore, or continue in operation, parking and loading facilities equal to the parking and loading to useable floor area ratio maintained at the time of such damage or destruction, and the parking and loading facilities shall conform to all other requirements of Sections 29 and 30.
(7) Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment. When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, regardless of any intent
to resume or not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed.
Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall comply with the use regulations of
the zoning district in which such land or structure is located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes, material shortages, or
natural disasters, and without any contributing fault by the nonconforming uses, shall not be
considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this Section.
4. Nonconforming Structures.
(A) Authority to Continue. Any nonconforming structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions set forth below.
(1) Repair, Maintenance, Alterations, and Enlargement. Except as limited below and allowed elsewhere in this Chapter, any nonconforming structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged; provided, however, that no such repair, maintenance, alteration, or enlargement shall either create any new non-conformity or increase the degree of the existing non-conformity of all or any part of such structure.
(2) Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall
thereafter conform to all of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being
moved.
(3) Damage or Destruction. Any nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed by any
means not within the control of the owner thereof, to any extent, may be repaired or restored;
provided, however, that no such repair or restoration shall be allowed that would increase the degree
of any non-conformity existing prior to such damage or destruction, and no such repair or restoration
shall be allowed for that portion of a structure encroaching into a public right-of-way or sight
triangle.
5. Nonconforming Lots. Subdivided lots of record in existence prior to the date of this ordinance, which do not meet the minimum width, area, and frontage requirements of this Chapter, shall be considered legally nonconforming and developable lots, provided all other regulations of this Chapter are satisfied and an approved public access is provided to the lot. If two or more nonconforming lots are contiguous and under single ownership at the time of the enactment of this Chapter, then such lots shall be combined for the purposes of development in order to satisfy the requirements of this Chapter.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 28
74
6. Nonconforming Junkyards. No junkyard may continue as a legal nonconforming use for more than one (1) year after the effective date of this Chapter, except that a junkyard may continue as a legal nonconforming use in an Industrial District if, within that period, it is completely enclosed within a building, fence, screened planting, or other device of such height as to completely screen the operations of the junkyard. Plans of such a building or device shall be subject to site plan review and shall be approved by the City Council, upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission, prior to the establishment of such building or device.
7. Nonconforming Parking, Driveway, and Driving Surfaces. All legal nonconforming off-street parking spaces, driveways, and driving surfaces which are not constructed in conformance with Section 29, Subd. 10 shall be hard surfaced with concrete or asphalt within one (1) year of any of the following:
(A) The issuance of a building permit which would allow the increase in the amount of lot coverage on the
zoning lot.
(B) The change in the principal use of the zoning lot.
(C) The hard surfacing of a public right-of-way, which was previously not hard surfaced with concrete or asphalt, when said right-of-way serves as an access to the nonconforming surface.
(D) A major reconstruction of a public roadway, as defined in the Perham Assessment Policy or Capital Improvements Program, when said right-of-way serves as an access to the nonconforming surface.
(E) The expansion of any existing, or development of any additional driveways, parking areas or driving areas on the zoning lot.
8. Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No use or structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have been terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it located.
9. Burden of Owner to Establish Legality of Non-Conformity. The burden of establishing that any non-conformity is lawfully existing under the provisions of this Section shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of the nonconforming property and not upon the City.

75
SECTION 29. OFF-STREET PARKING.

(2) If the Zoning Administrator determines that one or all of the land uses proposing to make use of
joint parking facilities do not conform to one of the general land use classifications in the Schedule
of Shared Parking Calculations, then the petitioner shall submit sufficient data to indicate that there
is not substantial conflict in the principal or peak operating hours of the uses.
(3) The property owners involved in the joint use of off-street parking facilities shall submit a legal
agreement approved by the City Attorney guaranteeing that the parking spaces shall be maintained
so long as the uses requiring parking are in existence unless the required parking is provided
elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Such instrument shall be recorded by

(B) Places of Assembly (Public or Private). In places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews, and other similar seating facilities, each twenty-two (22) inches of lineal bench or pew space shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of determining required off-street parking.
(C) Open Assembly Areas. In places of public assembly in which those in attendance shall be counted as
requiring one (1) parking space.
(D) Interpreting Calculation of Fractional Parking Spaces. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Section results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half (½) may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half (½) or more, shall be counted as one (1) parking space.
Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing on the premises or both, at any one time.
(E) Garages, Driveway Parking, Tandem Parking.
(1) Parking stalls located within a private garage may be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this Section.
(2) The area of the driveway immediately adjacent to the entrance to a private garage may be considered a parking area for the purpose of satisfying the off-street parking requirements of this Section, provided that such parking space(s) conforms to the dimensional requirements of this Section, and such parking spaces(s) shall not restrict or interfere with an internal traffic lane and shall not be located on a public right-of-way. All other areas of the driveway, as defined in Section 2, shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirement of this Section.

How to Use the Schedule of Shared Parking. For each applicable general land use category, calculate the number of spaces required for a use if it were free-standing (refer to the Schedule of Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements). Use those figures for each land use to calculate the number of spaces required for each time period for each use, (six (6) time periods per use). For each time period, add the number of spaces required for all applicable land uses to obtain a grand total for each of the six (6) time periods. Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement and use that total as your shared parking requirement.
20. Parking Requirements. In any district, whenever a building is erected, converted, enlarged or the use of the building or premises is altered, off-street parking shall be provided as follows:

Flickering or intense sources of light shall be controlled or shielded so as not to cause a nuisance across lot lines.
4. Exterior Lighting.
(A) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this lighting ordinance is to create standards for outdoor lighting which will provide for nighttime safety, security and utility while reducing light pollution, light trespass, and conserving energy.
It is the intent of this ordinance to require appropriate lighting levels, efficient (watts to lumens) lighting sources, full cut-off lighting, and to minimize/discourage lighting glare, lighting pollution and lighting trespass.
(B) Definitions. For the purposes of applying the regulations of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) Cutoff: The point at which all light rays emitted by a lamp, light source or luminary is
completely eliminated (cutoff) at a specific angle above the ground.
(2) Cutoff Angle: The maximum angle formed by a line drawn in the direction of emitted light
rays at the light source and a line perpendicular to the ground from the light source.
(3) Full Cutoff-Type Luminary: A luminary constructed or shielded to direct all light at a cutoff
angle of less than 90 degrees. Also, referred to as a Horizon Limited Luminary.
(4) Foot-candle: A unit of illumination produced on a surface, all points of which are one foot
from a uniform point source of one-candle.
(5) Glare: Direct light emitted from a light source which causes eye discomfort.
(6) Light Pollution: The shining of light produced by a luminary above the height of the
luminary and into the sky.
(7) Light Trespass: The shining of light produced by a luminary beyond the boundaries of the
property on which it is located.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 33
108
(8) Luminary: A complete lighting unit consisting of a light source and all necessary
mechanical, electrical and decorative parts.
(C) General Standards. The following provisions shall apply:
(1) General Standards for Lighting on Private Property:

c. Light sources or luminaries shall not be located within transitional yards except along pedestrian walkways.
d. All luminaries located on commercial, industrial, or institutional property shall be
designed so that the light source (bulb or lamp) is completely shielded from direct view of
an observer standing a point five feet above grade on the lot line abutting a transitional yard
or at any location on residentially zoned property.
e. All luminaries located on private property shall be designed so that the maximum
illumination at the property line shall not exceed one-half (1/2) foot candle.
f. Lighting for canopies covering fueling stations at automobile service stations and
drive-thru facilities shall not illuminate abutting properties and the luminaries shall be
designed so that the light source (bulb or lamp) is completely shielded from direct view of
an observer standing at the property line at a point five feet above grade.
g. Because of their unique requirement for nighttime visibility and their limited hours of operations, ball diamonds, playing fields and tennis courts are exempted from the general standards of this section. Lighting for these outdoor recreational uses shall be shielded to minimize light and glare from spilling over onto adjacent residential properties. The maximum permitted illumination at the property line shall not exceed two foot candles.
h. As part of the approval of public street or sidewalk projects, the City Council may
vary from the requirements of this Section.
i. The illumination levels contained in the Lighting Handbook, Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America, as amended from time to time, shall be used as a
guide for providing adequate and safe illumination levels. The City Council may require
conformance with the illumination levels contained in the Lighting Handbook, Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America as part of the review and approval of a private or
public development project.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 33
109
(2) Method of Measurement. Illumination levels shall be measured in foot candles with a meter
sensor in a horizontal position at an approximate height of three feet above grade. Maximum
illumination readings are to be taken directly beneath the luminary. Readings should normally be
taken after a cumulative initial lamp burn in period of at least 200 hours. To determine minimum
permitted illumination, illumination levels shall be measured in foot candles with a meter sensor in
a horizontal position at an approximate height of three feet above grade. The point at which
readings shall be taken is dependent upon the area classification and fixture arrangement as follows:
a. Opposite Spaced Street Lighting. (Requires two readings) Readings should betaken
as described above 1.) At the center of the street, equidistant between two sets of fixtures,
and 2.) at the curb line equidistant between two fixtures on the same side of the street.
b. Public Sidewalks. (Sharing a lighting system with the street) Readings should be
taken as described above at the farthest “house” side of the pavement, equidistant between
two fixtures.
c. Public Sidewalks. (Separate lighting system from street lighting) Readings should
be taken as described above in the center of the pavement, equidistant between two fixtures.
d. Parking Areas. (Perimeter lit) Readings should be taken as described above
equidistant between two fixtures at the perimeter, as well as at the location of the property
farthest from the fixtures.
e. Parking Areas. (Centrally lit or combination of central/perimeter lighting) Readings should be taken as described above in the center of large parking areas, equidistant between all of the fixtures illuminating the area. If perimeter lighting is also used, take readings as described in Parking Areas, Perimeter lit.
In instances where only one fixture is located on a property, the minimum illumination level shall be measured in foot candles with a meter sensor in a horizontal position located approximately three feet above grade. Readings should be taken at the location on the property farthest from the fixture.
(D) Exemptions. The following are exempt from the standards contained in this ordinance:
(1) Decorative seasonal lighting with a power rating of less than or equal to 75 watts per lamp.
(2) Lighting for one-and two family dwellings, provided that the lamps have a power rating of less than or equal to 75 watts, a cutoff component is incorporated in the design of the luminary, and the lighting level at the property line shall not exceed the maximum level contained in Subpart C. The maximum lighting level at the property line may be exceeded in cases where the lamp is turned on an off by a motion sensor and the lamp is not on for a continuous period exceeding ten minutes.
(3) Temporary emergency lighting used by police, fire fighters, or other emergency
services, as well as all vehicular luminaries.
(4) Hazard warning luminaries which are required by federal regulatory agencies.

(J) It will not jeopardize the public's health, safety, or general welfare.
6. Sequence of Approval of Applications for Both a Conditional Use and a Variance. Whenever the applicant indicates that a variance will be necessary in connection with the proposed conditional use (other than a planned unit development), the applicant shall at the time of filing for a conditional use, file an application for a variance with the Board of Adjustments and Appeals. The Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall not take any action on the application for a variance until the Planning Commission shall first act to recommend the granting of the Conditional Use Permit, granting the Conditional Use Permit subject to conditions, or denying the conditional use.
7. Conditions of Conditional Uses. The City Council, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission, may impose such conditions and limitations concerning the use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, parking and other matters relating to the purpose and objectives of this Chapter upon the premises benefited by a conditional use. In addition, the City Council may require a performance guarantee to be submitted to the City in order to ensure compliance with the terms of approval.
The conditions and limitations of approval may be more restrictive than standards outlined in this Chapter, but shall not be less restrictive. Such conditions and limitations may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the proposed property or on public facilities. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting the conditional use permit. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit pursuant to Section 41.
8. No Presumption of Approval. The listing of a conditional use within each zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such conditional use will be approved. Rather, each proposed conditional use shall be evaluated on an individual basis in order to determine whether approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed.
9. Effect of Approval. The approval of a proposed conditional use by the City Council shall not authorize the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of applications for such permits or approvals as may be required by the regulation of the City, including but not limited to a Building Permit and a Certificate of Occupancy.
10. Limitations on Conditional Uses. Subject to an extension of time granted by the City Council, no conditional use permit shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months, unless a Building Permit is issued, or unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued and the conditional use commenced within that period of time.
Except when otherwise provided in the resolution approving a conditional use, a conditional use shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question, rather than the owner or operator of such lot.
11. Fee. An applicant for a conditional use permit shall pay a non-refundable filing fee in connection with the submittal of the application in accordance with a fee schedule as established, from time to time, by the City Council.

4. Standards. In granting an Interim Use Permit, the Planning Commission and City Council shall consider the effect of the proposed use upon the health, safety, and general welfare of occupants of surrounding properties. The Planning Commission and City Council shall consider and make findings regarding the following factors:
(A) The proposed use meets the applicable zoning regulations;
(B) The proposed use will terminate upon a date or event that can be identified with certainty;

5. Standards. In considering an application for a variance, the Board of Adjustments and Appeals may approve such variance only upon the finding that the application complies with the standards set forth below.
(A) General Standard. Variances shall only be permitted when they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this Chapter and when the variances are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Variances may be granted when the applicant for the variance establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with this Chapter. “Practical difficulties”, as used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that 1) the property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by this Chapter, 2) the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner, and 3) the variance if granted, would not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
(B) Unique Circumstance. Unique circumstance is defined as the property is exceptional as compared to other property subject to the same provisions by reason of a unique physical condition, including the presence of an existing use or structure, whether conforming or nonconforming; irregular or substandard shape or size; exceptional topographical features; or other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the subject lot. The unique circumstance shall amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner and the hardship shall relate to the physical situation of the lot rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties.
(C) Not Self-Created. The unique physical condition and practical difficulties shall not be the result of any action or inaction of the property owner or its predecessors in title. The unique physical condition shall have existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a variance is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of governmental action, other than the adoption of this Chapter.
(D) Variance Less Than Requested. A variance less than or different from that requested may be granted when the record supports the applicant’s right to some relief but not to the relief requested.
(E) Essential Character of the Area. The variance would not result in a development on the lot that:
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 39
136
(1) Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development, or value of property or improvements permitted in the vicinity.
(2) Would materially impair an adequate supply of light and air to the properties and improvements in the vicinity.
(3) Would substantially increase congestion in the public streets due to traffic or parking.
(4) Would unduly increase the danger of flood or fire.
(5) Would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area.
(6) Would endanger the public health or safety.
(7) Would not be in harmony with the general and specific purposes of this Chapter and the comprehensive planning policies and objectives of the City.
6. Conditions on Variances. The Board of Adjustments and Appeals may impose specific conditions and limitations upon the granting of a variance as are necessary to achieve the purpose and objectives of this Chapter. Such conditions and limitations may include, but are not limited to, those concerning the use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, parking, and other matters relating to the purpose and objectives of this Chapter and shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting the variance. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variance pursuant to Section 41.
7. Effect of Grant of Variance. The approval of a proposed variance by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall not authorize the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of applications for such permits or approvals as may be required by the regulation of the City, including, but not limited to, a Building Permit and a Certificate of Occupancy.
8. Limitations on Variance. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals, no variance shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless a Building Permit is issued, or unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that period of time.
9. Prohibited Variances. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section, no variance shall be granted to establish a use not permitted in the zoning district where the property subject to the application is located.
10. Fee. An applicant for a variance shall pay a non-refundable filing fee in connection with the submittal of the application in accordance with a fee schedule as established, from time to time, by the City Council.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 40
137
SECTION 40. CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY AND BUILDING PERMITS.
1. Authority. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to review applications for Certificates of Occupancy and Building Permits in order to determine compliance with this Chapter.
2. Purpose. For the purposes of this Chapter, the Certificate of Occupancy, in part, provides a procedure for the inspection of completed premises to ensure their compliance with this Chapter and approved plans prior to commencement of the use or occupancy of such premises. The certificate also serves as evidence of compliance with other provisions of other codes or ordinances of the City. For the purposes of this Chapter, the Building Permit authorizes the development on a lot in conformance with applicable Sections of the Perham City Code and special approval conditions.
3. Certificate Required. Unless a Certificate of Occupancy shall have first been obtained certifying compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, no structure, or addition thereto, constructed, remodeled, altered, or moved shall be used for any purpose, and no vacant land shall be used or occupied for any purpose. Except for changes involving substitution of occupants in existing dwelling units, no use or occupancy of any land or structure shall be changed to any other use or occupancy without first obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy.
4. Procedure. The following procedures shall govern application for Certificates of Occupancy and Building Permits:
(A) Application. Applications for a Certificate of Occupancy and Building Permits shall be made to the Building Official. For the purpose of this Chapter, applications for a Building Permit shall include a site plan which conforms with the requirements of Section 34, Subd. 6.
(B) Action on Application. Within ten (10) days after the receipt of a completed application, the Building Official shall forward the application to the Zoning Administrator who shall review the application and inspect the subject structure or premises and shall take the following actions based on such inspection:
(1) If all construction has been completed and the structure and premises are in compliance, or the Building Permit application is complete and the accompanying plans depict a development that conforms with all the applicable provisions of this Chapter and special approval conditions, the Zoning Administrator shall approve the application for a Certificate of Occupancy or Building Permit.
(2) If, however, all work is not in compliance with all applicable requirements of this Chapter or the Building Permit application is incomplete and the accompanying plans depict a development that would not conform with all the applicable provisions of this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator shall deny the application and shall inform the applicant in writing of the specific deficiencies on which such denial is based, citing the particular provisions of this Chapter, the particular items in the applicant’s plans, or the applicable special approval conditions with respect to which compliance is lacking.
(C) Contents of Certificate. Every Certificate of Occupancy shall, at a minimum, state the specific use of the property for which it is issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any, pursuant to which it is issued, and shall set forth any conditions imposed in connection with any approval granted pursuant to this Chapter.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 40
138
(D) Filing of Certificates. Every Certificate of Occupancy issued pursuant to this Section shall be kept on file in the Building Official Department and shall be considered a public record, and shall be open for public inspection upon request.
(E) Additional Inspection Cost. The Zoning Administrator may, where necessary, require the services of a qualified testing laboratory to determine anticipated compliance with performance standards prior to issuance of a Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy. The cost of employing the testing laboratory shall be paid by the applicant.
5. Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. Pending the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, the Building Official may approve a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy for a period not exceeding six (6) months, pending the completion of the development, including the erection or alteration of a structure. The temporary certificate shall state its temporary nature, and it shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective rights, duties, or obligations of the owners or of the City relating to the use or occupancy of the premises or any other matter except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of the occupants and abutting properties. The Zoning Administrator or Building Official may require the property owner to submit a performance guarantee to the Building Official. The performance guarantee shall be held by the Building Official for the duration of the Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. The amount of the performance guarantee shall be equal to an amount deemed necessary to cause the completion of the development, including the erection or alteration of a structure. The performance guarantee shall only be returned to the property owner upon the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. If the Temporary Certificate of Occupancy expires and the development is not completed per the approved site plan, conditions of approval, and approved building plans, the City reserves the right to use the performance guarantee to cause the completion of the development, including the erection or alteration of a structure.
6. Certificate of Occupancy for Existing Uses. The Zoning Administrator may approve a Certificate of Occupancy certifying the lawful existence and use of any existing structure or use, provided it is issued in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as described in this Section. The certificate shall evidence only that which is contained in the certificate with respect to any structure or use as of the date of its issue and shall remain effective only for that purpose for so long as neither the use or structure nor the applicable provisions of this Chapter are changed.
7. Certificate of Occupancy for Legal Nonconforming Uses. The Zoning Administrator may approve a Certificate of Occupancy certifying the lawful existence and use of any nonconforming use, structure, lot, sign, or fence, provided it is issued in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as described in this Section.
8. Void Certificates of Occupancy and Building Permit. Any Certificate of Occupancy or Building Permit issued in violation of the provisions of this Chapter, shall be void immediately upon issue and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 41
139
SECTION 41. ENFORCEMENT.
1. Authority. The Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to enforce all the provisions of this Chapter and shall perform the following duties:
(A) Inspections. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to periodically inspect buildings, structures, and uses of land to determine compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, or of any permit or approval granted pursuant to this Chapter, or of any condition imposed pursuant to this Chapter on any such permit or approval. In regard to performance standards, the Zoning Administrator may require the services of a testing laboratory to determine compliance. The cost of the laboratory services shall be paid for by the person responsible for the violation if one is so determined.
(B) Procedure Upon Discovery of Violation. Upon finding the existence of any violation of this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator may take any or all of the following procedures:
(1) Stop and Cease-and Desist Orders. Upon finding the existence of any violation of this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator shall notify, in writing, the person responsible for such violation, indicating the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it; specifically, the Zoning Administrator shall order the discontinuance of any illegal use of land or structures, the removal of illegal structures, additions, or alterations, and the discontinuance of illegal work being done.
(2) Legal Action. In the enforcement of this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator shall exercise all the powers authorized by the statutes of the State of Minnesota and City Codes and Ordinances to ensure compliance with, or to prevent or abate any violation of the provisions of this Chapter, and in particular shall, when necessary or appropriate, shall cause the City Attorney to initiate any and all actions, legal or equitable, including appeals, that may be required for the enforcement of this Chapter.
(3) Revocation of Permits. The violation of any provision of this Chapter, or of any permit or approval granted pursuant to this Chapter, or of any condition imposed pursuant to this Chapter on any such permit or approval, shall be grounds for the revocation of any permit, variance, or approval granted pursuant to this Chapter. If the Zoning Administrator determines any such violation exists, the Zoning Administrator shall forward a report to the City Council regarding the violation.
The City Council shall hold a public hearing regarding the violation, after which the Council shall either, revoke the permit or approval, modify the original conditions of the permit or approval, or affirm the compliance with the permit or approval.
(4) Fines and Penalties. In the enforcement of this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator shall, when necessary and appropriate, order the issuance and enforcement of citations to recover fines and penalties for the violation of this Chapter as authorized by State Law and this Chapter.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 42
140
SECTION 42. ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS.
1. Authority. The Zoning Administrator, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations herein, may, in written request, render interpretations, including use interpretations, of the provisions of this Chapter and of any rule or regulations issued pursuant to it.
2. Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this Chapter, is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Chapter, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific situation to which they may have it be applied. Many such situations can be readily addressed by interpretation of the specific provisions of this Chapter in light of the general and specific purpose for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority established is administrative rather than legislative, it is not intended to add or change the essential content of this Chapter, but is intended only to allow authoritative applications of that content to specific cases.
3. Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations. Requests for interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation. Requests shall not be accepted when based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
4. Procedure. The following procedure shall govern requests for administrative interpretations:
(A) Requests. Requests for interpretations of this Chapter shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, and shall contain at least the following information:
(1) The property owner’s name and address, and the owner’s signed consent to the filing of the application.
(2) The applicant’s name and address, if different than the owner, and the applicant’s interest in the subject property.
(3) The specific provision or provisions of this Chapter for which an interpretation is sought.
(4) The facts of the specific situation given rise to the request for an interpretation.
(5) The precise interpretation claimed by the applicant to be correct.
(6) In cases of use interpretations, the use permitted in the particular zoning classification that is claimed to be included, or be most similar to, the proposed use sought.
(7) In cases of a use interpretation, documents, statements, and other evidence demonstrating that the proposed use will comply with all use limitations established for the district in which it is proposed to be located.
(B) Action On. Within thirty (30) days following the receipt of a properly filed request, the Zoning Administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of the interpretation, stating the reasons for the determination therein.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 42
141
(C) Records. A permanent record of all requests for interpretations shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
(D) Appeals. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Zoning Administrator may be made to the Board of Adjustments and Appeals.
5. Standards for Use Interpretations. The following standards shall govern the Zoning Administrator, and the Board of Adjustments and Appeals when on appeal, in issuing use interpretations:
(A) Any use defined in Section 2 of this Chapter shall be interpreted as therein defined.
(B) No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with the general district regulations established for that particular district.
(C) No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that district and is more similar to such other uses permitted or conditionally permitted in a more restrictive district.
(D) If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a conditional use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a conditional use permit for such use pursuant to Section 36.
(E) No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that would not be consistent with the statement of purpose of the district in question.
6. Effect of Favorable Use Interpretations. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a particular district shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes or ordinances of the City, including but not limited to, a Building Permit, a Certificate of Occupancy, subdivision approval, and site plan approval.
7. Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. Subject to a possible extension of time granted by the Zoning Administrator, no use interpretation finding a use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months from date of issuance unless action has been taken by the applicant in the form of the use being established or a Building Permit and construction or a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained.

144
SECTION 44. APPEALS.
1. Authority. The Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from any order or final decision of the Zoning Administrator by any person aggrieved by such order or final decision.
2. Purpose. The appeal process is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary, ill-considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It is intended to avoid the need for legal action by establishing local procedures to review and correct administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as a means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intent of this Chapter or the rightful authority of the Zoning Administrator to enforce the requirements of this Chapter. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied in the language of this Chapter and to the reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with the administration of this Chapter.
3. Stay of Proceedings. The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustments and Appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order that may be granted by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals or by a court of record.
4. Procedure. An application for an appeal shall be processed in accordance with the following procedures:

(D) Notice. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in accordance with current Minnesota State Statute Guidelines.
(E) Board of Adjustments and Appeals Action. The Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order or final decision as in its option ought to be made in the premises, and to that end has all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
5. Right to Grant Variances in Deciding Appeals. In any case where the application is accompanied by an application for a variance in accordance with Section 39 of this Chapter, the Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall have the authority to grant, as part of the relief, a variance, provided it is done so in strict compliance with the provisions of Section 39.
PERHAM CITY CODE SECTION 44
145
6. Conditions and Limitations on Rights Granted by Appeal.
