department for review and recommendation. The police department shall investigate the matter and make the review and recommendation to the Council as
soon as possible, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days following receipt of the application by the city. The Council shall receive the police
department's report and consider the application within forty-five (45) days of the date the application was submitted to the clerk.
3. Approval Or Denial Of Application: The applicant shall be notified in writing of the date on which the Council will consider the recommendation. The
Council shall, by resolution, approve or disapprove the application within sixty (60) days of receipt of the application.
C. Grounds For Ineligibility: The Council shall deny an application for issuance of a premises permit for any of the following reasons:
1. Violation by the gambling organization of any state statute, state rule, or city ordinance relating to gambling within the last three (3) years.
2. The premises for which a premises permit is sought is not an on-sale liquor establishment.
3. The organization that will conduct the lawful gambling is ineligible for an organizational license from the Board.
4. There are already two Licensed Organizations permitted to conduct lawful gambling activities at the premises.
5. Failure of the applicant to pay the investigation fee provided by this section within the prescribed time limit.
6. Operation of gambling at the site would be detrimental to health, safety, and welfare of the community.
D. Renewal: The Council is without authority to compel the owner of an on-sale liquor establishment to renew a premises permit. (Ord. 1206, 3-8-2010)
4-7-9: PRIORITY IN APPROVAL PROCESS:
It is anticipated that there may be multiple organizations applying for an available premises permit at a single on-sale liquor establishment. Therefore, if the
on-sale liquor establishment refuses to pick one of the applicants but indicates that the multiple applicants are equally acceptable, the following criteria, in
the order listed, prioritize and determine the approval for the available premises permit:
A. If there are two (2) or more applications and if the on-sale liquor establishment refuses to pick one of the applicants but indicates that the multiple
applicants are equally acceptable, then a Local Organization will be preferred over an organization that does not meet the definition of Local Organization.
Because of the nuisance prone nature of gambling, compared to other licensing or permitting activities within the city, the city prefers that the organization
have a local connection so as to facilitate investigation of applicants and the investigation and arrest of violators. Where two (2) or more organizations seek
to obtain an available premises permit at the same on-sale liquor establishment and where the on-sale liquor establishment refuses to pick one of the
applicants but indicates that the multiple applicants are equally acceptable, the organization that meets the definition of Local Organization will be preferred
over an organization that does not meet the definition.
B. If two (2) or more nonlocal organizations seek approval, the Council will approve the organization which applied first. (Ord. 1206, 3-8-2010)
4-7-10: INSPECTIONS:
A. All Licensed Organizations are deemed to have consented to inspection of the licensed or permitted premises by the city.
B. Authorized employees or agents of the city may inspect, at any reasonable time without notice or search warrant, all records, including gambling
accounts and other bank records, required by the Board to be maintained and preserved. (Ord. 1206, 3-8-2010)

4-7-12: NOTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CHANGES TO APPLICATION:
An organization holding a state issued premises permit shall notify the city within ten (10) days in writing whenever any material change is made in the
information submitted on the application. (Ord. 1206, 3-8-2010)
4-7-13: DESIGNATED TRADE AREA:
A. During the calendar year, each Licensed Organization within the city having a premises permit within the city shall expend at least sixty percent (60%) of
its net profits expenditures made that year on lawful purposes conducted within the city's Trade Area.
B. This section applies only to lawful purpose expenditures of net profits derived from gambling conducted at a premises within the city's jurisdiction. For
purposes of this section, net profits are gross profits less amounts expended for allowable expenses and paid in taxes assessed on lawful gambling. (Ord.
1264, 4-22-2013)
4-7-14: RECORDS AND REPORTING:
A. Licensed Organizations shall file with the clerk one copy of all records and reports required to be filed with the Board, pursuant to Minnesota Statutes,

calendar year. (Ord. 1206, 3-8-2010)
4-7-15: HOURS OF OPERATION:
Lawful gambling shall not be conducted between two o'clock (2:00) A.M. and eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. on any day of the week. (Ord. 1206, 3-8-2010)
4-7-16: PENALTY:

sections 609.75 through 609.763, inclusive, as they may be amended from time to time; or Minnesota Statutes sections 349.11 through 349.21, as they may

CITY OF INVER GROVE HEIGHTS
DAKOTA COUNTY
ORDINANCE NO. 1366
CREATING CHAPTER 15 TO TITLE 4
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 25/526
OF THE CITY CODE
REGARDING EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION
OF CITY SERVICES
THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF INVER GROVE HEIGHTS ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
Section One. Amendment. Creation of a new Chapter 15 to Title 4 of the Inver Grove Heights City Code regarding excessive consumption of city
services.
4-15-1: POLICY, PURPOSE, OBJECTIVE, INTENT:
The city council finds some property owners take little or no responsibility for the maintenance of their property until the city, through its
various inspections programs, has repeatedly ordered them to remedy violations of the City Code. Such property owners create excessive
costs for the city that are over and above the normal cost of providing inspection services in the city. Property owners who the city must
repeatedly order to remedy Code violations on their property consume a disproportionate share of limited city resources.
It is the intent of the city council, by the adoption of this section, to impose and collect the costs associated with re-inspections and the
excessive consumption of city inspection services. The collection of such costs for certain properties shall be by assessment against the real
property requiring such excessive inspection or reinspection services, pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 429.101, which authorizes the council to
provide for reinspection fees to be collected by special assessment and allows cities to collect the costs associated with the removal or
elimination of public health or safety hazards.
The city council also intends, by the adoption of this chapter, to impose on and collect from the owner of a property the city cost for police and
law enforcement services which are over and above the cost of providing normal law enforcement services and police protection city-wide, if
the said excess costs are spent to abate a nuisance which has occurred, or is maintained and permitted, on the property. The collection of the
costs for such excess police services shall be by assessment against the property on which the nuisance, or activity constituting the nuisance,
occurs, pursuant to the authority in the City Code empowering the council to abate nuisances and collect the costs of such abatement by
special assessment. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from using the authority and procedures in any other provision of the city ordinance
or statute, including but not limited to Minnesota Statutes, section 429.101.
4-15-2: DEFINITIONS:
Except as expressly provided in this chapter, words, terms, and phrases used in this chapter have the meanings given to them by this code. In
cases where conflicting definitions of a word, term or phrase make its precise meaning unclear in its application to particular facts, the city
administrator is authorized to resolve the definition. For purposes of this chapter the following terms below have the meanings given them:
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: a person or employee appointed by the City, such as, code compliance official, chief building official, building
inspector, fire marshal/inspector, police officer, and health official who may review or conduct code enforcement inspections or enforcement
actions for the city.
EXCESSIVE INSPECTION SERVICES: more than four (4) inspections by city staff generated at any one address for existing or new
violations of the City Code within a continuous 12-month period.

borne by the city for its staff time in conducting "excessive inspection services," as defined, not otherwise necessary, but required due to the
condition(s) of the property; the lack of compliance of the property to the applicable code(s) or previous inspection orders, or both. The fee
being imposed is an administrative fee, with no connection real or implied to any fine, penalty or abatement expense otherwise imposed,
levied, or ordered by the city or a court pursuant to any and all other legal remedies available to the city.
EXCESSIVE POLICE AND NUISANCE ENFORCEMENT SERVICES: those services provided at a specific property address after four (4) or

LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: the address shown by Dakota County Property Records or a more recent address known to the police
department. In the case of parties not listed in these records, the last known address shall be that address obtained by the police department
after a reasonable search. If no address can be found, such address shall be that of the property on which the nuisance occurred, was
maintained or permitted.
NUISANCE SERVICE CALL: a response to any activity, conduct or condition occurring within the city that unreasonably annoys, injures, or

The city council of Inver Grove Heights does hereby ordain:
Section 1. Authority.
1.1 Minnesota statutes, sections 415.02, 415.021, and 599.13 authorize the city to codify its ordinances and print them in various formats,
including book, loose leaf or pamphlet form, and provide that any ordinance included in a new code but not previously published is sufficiently
published if a substantial quantity of the code is printed for distribution to the general public.
1.2 The city has completed a recodification the ("recodification"), of the 1974 Code of city ordinances ("city code"), which was prepared by
Sterling Codifiers with assistance from city staff, and which incorporates ordinances through ordinance no. 1176.

recodification is on file with the deputy city clerk.
1.4 Minnesota statutes sections 331A.01, subdivision 10, and 412.191, subdivision 4 allow publication by title and summary in the event of
lengthy ordinances or those containing charts or maps. The city council finds that the summary of the recodification would clearly inform the
public of the intent and effect of the recodification; that the recodification is lengthy, comprising two volumes and exceeding 200 pages in
length; and summary publication is appropriate.

Failure to report such information could result in disciplinary action. If it is determined that such medication may impair the employee's ability
to perform the essential requirements of the position, every effort shall be made within the limits of these regulations to place such employee
in gainful employment with the city for the duration of the medical treatment. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)

department heads immediately. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-13-4: INJURY ON DUTY:

for long term disability benefits.
c. Upon utilization of all accrued personal leave or vacation leave, an employee may "borrow" future personal leave and/or vacation
leave in an amount equal to time absent from work. Borrowing shall occur until such time as claim determination is made.

the next subsequent workday. The amount of the workers' compensation payment will be deducted from the employee's gross earnings
of the next available payroll check. Accrued personal leave and/or vacation will then be reinstated equal to the number of hours paid by
the workers' compensation check.
5. If the claim is denied, then the employee will utilize accrued personal leave or vacation leave until the employee returns to work, or the
employee may request an unpaid leave of absence. If accrued personal leave and/or vacation leave are not available, then time absent
from work will be considered leave without pay, and the next available payroll check will be adjusted accordingly.
E. Mandatory Physicals: Any employee who is injured in the line of duty may be required to undergo a physical examination by a licensed city
appointed physician. Based upon the findings of the city physician, the employee's department head will authorize the employee to return
to work. If the employee has physical limitations that prevent the performance of regular position duties, other duties consistent with the
employee's physical limitations may be assigned during the period of recuperation.
F. Return To Work Authorization: Employees injured on duty are required to submit a written return to work authorization from a medical doctor
indicating the date authorized to return to duties and any medical limitations. This medical authorization will be permanently filed in the

1-6A-16: GROUP INSURANCE AND LONG TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE:
Group insurance and long term disability insurance fringe benefits, because of changing needs, the difficulty of obtaining and retaining
coverage desired, and related factors, discourage specific ordinance commitments. Recognizing this difficulty, but demonstrating council
intent, the following position is outlined:
A. The city shall provide a group health and life insurance program as well as a long term disability program. The general scope of coverage
and the degree of city financial participation shall be determined by council resolution which shall have the same effect as though it were
part of this code. The specific details of coverages shall be covered in the appropriate master insurance policy.
B. The employee benefits enumerated in this section are offered at the city's sole discretion to eligible employees. The enumeration of these
benefits should not be construed as a claim of entitlement to the benefits described, as the benefits set forth may be changed from time to
time. The city reserves the right to change, delete, modify, or otherwise revise employee benefits and eligibility requirements regarding
benefits at any time and, in its sole discretion, with or without notice to employees unless otherwise prohibited by law.
C. The insurance benefits provided are specified in materials provided by the respective insurance carriers. The respective insurance carriers
may have different requirements concerning the eligibility of employees. The requirements of the carrier will govern eligibility. The city
reserves the right to change insurance carriers and programs at any time. Any such change may affect eligibility requirements and/or
benefit limits under any given policy. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-17: EXISTING ACCRUED BENEFITS:
All employees who had accrued benefits prior to the adoption of this code on November 12, 1974, shall have, on the date of the adoption of

the provisions of this code. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-18: RESIGNATION:
Any employee in good standing, wishing to leave the municipal service, shall file with the department head, at least fourteen (14) days before
leaving, a written resignation stating the effective date of the resignation and the reason for leaving. The employee may, at the discretion of
the city administrator, be required to participate in an exit interview regarding the reason(s) for resigning. Failure to comply with the above
stated procedures may be considered cause for denying such employee future employment by the city and denying terminal leave benefits.
Unauthorized absence from work for a period of three (3) working days may be considered as a resignation without benefits. (Ord. 888, 3-11-
1997)
1-6A-19: GRIEVANCES:
A. Policy: It shall be the policy of the city to adjust all grievances promptly and fairly. Every effort shall be made to adjust grievances in such a
manner as to be satisfactory to the employee and the supervisor. Any employee who has allegedly received inequitable treatment in
employment may personally, or through a legally recognized representative, appeal to the city administrator and discuss the grievance with
the employee and/or the respective supervisor in accordance with the provisions of this section. Employees shall be free from restraint,
interference, discrimination or reprisal in the presentation of their grievances.
B. First Step: Any employee, or group of employees, having a grievance shall file the grievance in writing with the supervisor within fourteen
(14) working days after an alleged incident has occurred. It shall be the responsibility of the supervisor to investigate and seek a solution to
the problem. The supervisor shall discuss the problem with both the employee and others who have knowledge of the facts involved and
recommend a solution. The supervisor shall recommend in writing a solution within five (5) working days of the grievance first being
brought to the supervisor's attention.
C. Second Step: If the employee is not satisfied with the results of the first step, the employee shall, within five (5) days of receipt of the
recommended solution, put the grievance in writing and submit it to the department head. The department head shall investigate the
problem and facts involved, and discuss the matter with parties concerned. After a full investigation, and within five (5) working days, the
department head shall advise the parties of his/her decision in writing. An extension must: 1) receive written concurrence of the aggrieved
party and the department head; and 2) specify the length of extension.

D. Third Step:
1. If the employee is not satisfied with the results of the second step, the employee shall, within five (5) days of receipt of the
recommended solution, put the grievance in writing and submit it to the city administrator. The administrator shall fully investigate the
problem and the facts involved and discuss the matter with the parties concerned.
2. After a full investigation, the administrator shall advise the parties concerned of the administrator's decision in writing. The decision of
the administrator shall be considered final and shall be rendered within five (5) days of receipt of a written grievance. An extension must:

appealed to the city council.
E. Limitations: Any employee under the auspices of a collective bargaining agreement who grieves disciplinary action through the provisions
of a bargaining agreement may not access the grievance policies of the personnel policy. Pursuant to section 1-6A-7 of this article,
employees in the orientation period are precluded from the grievance process or procedure. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-20: LAYOFFS:
A. The city council, upon the recommendation of the city administrator, may lay off any employee whenever such action is made necessary by
reason of shortage of work or funds, the abolition of a position or because of changes in organization. Provided, however, that two (2)
weeks' advance written notice shall be given. No full time employee shall be laid off while there are temporary or part time employees
serving in the same class of positions for which a full time employee is qualified, eligible and available. A full time employee will be given
absolute preference over an employee in the orientation period. All other things being equal, consideration will be given to the employee's
length of service in determining the order of layoffs. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997; amd. 2008 Code)
B. The city council, upon the recommendation of the city administrator, may make any changes necessary to the operating hours of the city
hall and the work schedule of city employees to increase the efficiency or accessibility of city services to city residents. (Ord. 888, 3-11-

administrator.
6. No city equipment shall be utilized for outside employment, unless authorized by the department head. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-22: DISCIPLINE:
A. Administration: City employees shall be subject to disciplinary action for cause. The city reserves the right to administer disciplinary action
in any manner it deems appropriate. Progressive discipline measures used shall be at the sole discretion of the city, contingent upon the
determination of the act of severity as to the disciplinary action to be imposed.
B. Authority: A department head or the city administrator may exercise the option to rescind the following employee personnel actions initiated
by a supervisor: transfer, suspension, reward, grievance adjustment, disciplinary action, discharge, promotion or appointment.
C. Verbal Warning: A "verbal warning" is a discussion with an employee about a relatively minor offense. Verbal warnings shall be
documented including the date and content of the discussion and the parties present. A written report documenting the discussion shall be
maintained in the employee's personnel file.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 82/526
D. Written Reprimand: A "written warning" is a formal written statement to an employee which describes the offense, and may refer to
previous verbal warnings, states the deficiency or misconduct, describes the past actions taken by the supervisor to correct the problem,
states the desired goals or outcomes of this action and outlines subsequent disciplinary action should the problem continue. In the case of
a written reprimand, the employee shall be required to acknowledge notice of said reprimand by signing the reprimand. By signing, the
employee is not necessarily agreeing with the charges, but is acknowledging that notice of such a reprimand was issued to and received
by the employee. The signed reprimand shall be placed in the employee's personnel file permanently. A reprimand may be administered
by the employee's immediate supervisor or any supervisor above the immediate supervisor.
E. Suspension Without Pay: A "suspension without pay" is an involuntary temporary absence from duty. Prior to the suspension, or as soon
after the action as possible, the employee shall receive a written notice of suspension, indicating the reasons for the suspension, length of
suspension and an outline of further disciplinary actions should the problem(s) continue. Notice and reason for such suspension shall
receive written acknowledgment by the employee but shall not be construed as an agreement with the reasons or actions taken. A
department head or supervisor may suspend an employee without pay whenever the cause for discipline is not sufficiently grave for
discharge. Such suspension shall not exceed thirty (30) working days within one calendar year. In the event a supervisor suspends an
employee, the department head shall be notified in writing of any such action and the reasons therefor. All material relating to a
suspension action shall remain in the employee's personnel file permanently. The employee's anniversary date with the city will be
adjusted by the number of days of the suspension. This action will also result in the following if the suspension without pay exceeds fifteen
(15) working days within a calendar year:
1. The employee will not accrue salary, vacation or personal leave, nor is the employee entitled to use such time while on suspension.
2. During suspension, the employee must make direct payments to maintain insurance coverage.
F. Forced Transfer: A forced transfer occurs when an employee is transferred from a position in a department to a position of equal level in a
different department or division to eliminate a specific conflict within a department or division. This action requires the recommendation of
the department head and approval of the city administrator. The written notice of a forced transfer shall be permanently included in the
employee's personnel file.
G. Demotion: A demotion may occur when an employee fails to meet the standards expected at a higher classification. The employee's
performance is such that dismissal is unwarranted, yet other forms of disciplinary action, i.e., reprimand, force transfer, or suspension
without pay will not solve the problem. A demotion must be recommended by the city administrator and be confirmed by the city council.
The written notice of demotion shall be permanently included in the employee's personnel file. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
H. Dismissal:
1. Definition: "Dismissal" is the complete separation of the employee from the municipal service.
2. General Provisions: Any officer or employee subject to the provisions of this code may be dismissed from the municipal service.
Dismissed employees need not be kept in employment or be paid for any time after the completion of the normal working day they are
dismissed, unless the employee claims veterans rights. (Ord. 1125, 12-12-2005)
3. Dismissal Of Veteran: Veterans shall be treated as defined in Minnesota statutes section 197.46, veterans preference act; removal
forbidden; right of mandamus.
4. Dismissal Of Employee In The Orientation Period: An employee in the orientation period may be dismissed without cause. The city
administrator, upon the recommendation of the department head, may concur with or overturn the recommendation of the department
head to dismiss an employee. In the event the city administrator recommends dismissal, the city council then may reverse or ratify the
dismissal recommendation. An orientation employee shall not receive a hearing before the city council. Employees in the orientation
period do not have any grievance rights, except under the veterans preference act. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
5. Procedure:
a. When a department head determines such action is necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the city, the department head
shall recommend to the city administrator that an employee be dismissed. The recommendation shall contain the reasons why it is
necessary for the department head to recommend dismissal rather than alternative personnel action.
b. The city administrator will review the recommendation from the department head. If the city administrator concurs with the dismissal
recommendation, the employee shall be notified of the recommended dismissal. The notification shall be in writing and contain the
reasons and the effective date.
c. The city administrator shall prepare a summary of the recommended dismissal for the city council's consideration. The employee shall
be informed of the right to be present for a hearing before the city council. The city council may reverse or ratify the dismissal
recommendation or may impose another form of discipline. (Ord. 1125, 12-12-2005)
I. Cause: Adequate cause for disciplinary action that may result in dismissal may include, but is not limited to, the following kinds of conduct
and conduct of a similar type:
1. Conduct or performance on the job which fails to adequately satisfy the duties and responsibilities of the position or classification held
by the employee.
2. Conduct or performance on the job which fails to produce the quality or quantity of work the position or classification requires.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

The City Council finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers.

such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City.

regulation of the pawnbroker and precious metal industries, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawnbroker and precious
metal industries through the timely collection and sharing of pawnbroker and precious metal transaction information, this chapter also

organization that meets the definition of local organization will be preferred over an organization that does not meet the definition.

Chapter 8
MASSAGE THERAPY
4-8-1: MASSAGE THERAPY REGULATIONS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to prohibit the operation of massage businesses and the offering of massage services to the public
except by those licensed as therapeutic massage businesses and massage therapists pursuant to this section. The licensing regulations
prescribed herein are necessary in order to protect businesses that are operating legitimate businesses, to prevent criminal activity and to
protect the health and welfare of the community. The purpose of this section is not to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of
protected speech or expression.
B. Findings Of The City Council: The city council makes the following findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage businesses
and massage therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and services to the public:
1. Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and hygiene can provide a legitimate and
necessary service to the general public.
2. Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage businesses and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of
communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation.
3. Establishing license qualifications for therapeutic massage businesses and therapists can minimize the risk that such businesses and
persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the community.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 142/526
4. Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized training can tax law enforcement services because
such businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity than operations established by
persons with standardized training.
5. The training of professional massage therapists at accredited institutions is an important means of ensuring the fullest measure of
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

ALARM SYSTEMS
5-3-1: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the ALARM ORDINANCE. (1974 Code § 907.01)
5-3-2: POLICY AND PURPOSE:
To protect the public health, safety and welfare, the city council deems it necessary to provide for the special and express regulations of alarm
systems which are designed to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which public safety personnel are expected
to respond. The city council finds that the regulation of alarm systems is necessary in order to reduce the increasing frequency of false alarms
in the city. The great number of and increasing frequency of these false alarms require intensive and time consuming efforts by the police and
fire departments and thereby distract from and reduce the level of services available to the rest of the community. This diminishes the ability of
the city to promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide
numerous public safety services to all segments of the community, without an undue concentration of public services in one area to the
detriment of members of the general public, it is hereby decided that the alarm systems shall be regulated through the permit process
described in this chapter. (1974 Code § 907.03)
5-3-3: DEFINITIONS:

a monitoring agency which then notifies the police and/or fire department.
ALARM SYSTEM: A single device or a combination of approved compatible devices with the necessary electrical interconnection and energy
to produce an alarm signal in the event of an emergency. The alarm signal, when initiated, must be connected to a monitoring agency which
notifies the police and/or fire department of an emergency to which public safety personnel initiate a response, or emits an audible local signal
which is reported to the police and/or fire department to which public safety personnel initiate a response.
ALARM USER: The person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, or organization of any kind on whose premises an alarm
system is located. "Alarm user" includes persons occupying dwelling units for residential purposes.
CALENDAR YEAR: The period from January 1 through December 31 of each year.

2. Graffiti is a visual symbol of disorder eroding public safety, contributing to a downward spiral of blight and decay, lessening property
values, business viability and ultimately tax revenues and, as such, is inconsistent with the city's property maintenance goals and
aesthetic standards.
3. The failure to maintain one's property by removing graffiti after being ordered by the city to do so within a reasonable period of time is
injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents of the city.
B. Definition:
GRAFFITI: Any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, painting, or other defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed,
drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of a permanent structure, fixture or object, including, but not limited to:
buildings, walls, fences, bridges, benches, shelters, sidewalks, hydrants, fountains, pavement, curbs, trees, rocks, signs, utility poles or
boxes situated on public or private property to the extent that the inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement was not authorized

of police, code compliance specialist or their designees. Any person applying graffiti is responsible for the removal or for the payment of
the removal. Failure of any person to remove graffiti or pay for the removal will constitute an additional violation of this section. If graffiti
is applied by a person under eighteen (18) years old, the parents or legal guardian will also be responsible for such removal or for the
payment for the removal. Notice shall be served as provided in this section.

5-5-10: COAL TAR BASED SEALER:
A. Purpose: The city understands that the lakes, rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city are natural assets that enhance the
environmental, recreational, cultural and economic resource of the city and that they contribute to the general health and welfare of the
community.
The use of sealers on asphalt driveways is a common practice. However, scientific studies on the use of driveway sealers have
demonstrated a relationship between stormwater runoff and certain health and environmental concerns.
The purpose of this section is to prohibit the use of coal tar based sealer within the city to protect water quality within the city.
B. Definitions: For purposes of this section, the following shall mean:
ASPHALT BASED SEALER: A petroleum based sealer material that is commonly used on driveways, parking lots, and other surfaces and
which does not contain coal tar.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 189/526
COAL TAR: A byproduct of the process used to refine coal.
COAL TAR BASED SEALER: A sealer material containing coal tar and used as a sealer on asphalt and concrete surfaces, including
driveways, parking lots, and other surfaces.
MPCA: The Minnesota pollution control agency.

employee, independent contractor, volunteer, or other person to apply any coal tar based sealer to any driveway, parking lot, or other
surface within the City.

the use of asphalt based sealer within the City.
E. Coal Tar Based Sealer Use Exemption: Upon the prior express written approval from both the City and MPCA, a person conducting bona
fide research on the effects of coal tar based sealer or PAHs on the environment shall be exempt from the coal tar based use prohibitions
provided in this section. (Ord. 1247, 11-14-2011)
5-5-11: PREDATORY OFFENDER RESIDENCY:
A. Findings And Intent:
1. Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators
who present an extreme threat to public safety. Current information indicates that such predatory offenders are likely to use physical
violence and to repeat their offenses, and most predatory offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever
reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The cost of predatory offender victimization to society at large, while not
precisely calculable, is steep.
2. It is the intent of this section to serve the City's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain
predatory offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences.
3. The Inver Grove Heights City Council has determined that it is necessary and in the public interest to impose a permanent ordinance
limiting the residency locations of designated predatory offenders within the City.

2. For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation required by this section, the requirement shall be measured by following
a straight line from the outer property line of the property where the permanent or temporary residence of the designated predatory

park, or library property.
3. A designated predatory offender residing within a prohibited area as described in this section does not commit a violation of this section

wishes to be on the list and has decided not to grant permission for hunting or target practice. The name of the owner and the parcel
address shall be removed from the list if the owner files a written request with the clerk to remove the owner name and parcel address.
The creation of the list is a voluntary program. There is no requirement that an owner and parcel be on the list in order for the owner to
decline permission to anyone for hunting or target practice. The purpose of the list is to present an opportunity for an owner to make
known that the owner has decided not to grant permission with the result that contacts with the owner are reduced or eliminated.
4. The council, by resolution, may in its discretion on an annual basis add parcels to that geographic portion of the city available for hunting
or target practice referenced in subsection D1a of this section. If the council adds additional parcels by resolution, the authorization
granted by the resolution and the inclusion of such parcels within the above referenced geographic area shall expire on December 31 of
the year when the resolution was passed. If an owner wishes the council to include the owner's parcel within the above referenced
geographic area, the owner must make an application to the city no later than August 15 of the year the owner wishes the parcel to be
included. (Ord. 1320, 8-22-2016)

and the owners and operators of such ranges shall comply with all regulations for such ranges that the city may hereinafter enact. Violation
of any of the terms of such regulations constitutes a violation of this section and is cause for revocation of the license granted under the
terms of this section. (1974 Code § 925.05)

DISEASED TREES
5-8-1: POLICY AND PURPOSE:
The city council has determined that the health of the elm trees within city limits is threatened by a fatal disease known as Dutch elm disease,
that oak trees are threatened by a disease known as oak wilt, and that ash trees are threatened by the emerald ash borer. The council has
further determined that the loss of such trees growing upon public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of property
within the city, cause significant costs to the public for tree removal, and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the
public. It is declared to be the intention of the council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases as well as infestation by these
insects, and this chapter is enacted for that purpose. (Ord. 1217, 8-9-2010)
5-8-2: FORESTER:
The powers and duties of the forester, as set forth herein, are conferred upon the city forester. It is the duty of the forester to coordinate, under
the direction and control of the council, all activities of the city relating to control and prevention of Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, and emerald
ash borers. He shall recommend to the council the details of a program for the control of Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, and emerald ash borers
and perform the duties incident to such a program adopted by the council. (Ord. 1217, 8-9-2010)
5-8-3: DUTCH ELM, OAK WILT, AND EMERALD ASH BORER DISEASE PROGRAM:
A. Intent: It is the intention of the city council to conduct a program of plant pest control pursuant to the authority granted by Minnesota
statutes chapter 18G. The program is specifically aimed at the control and elimination of the following:
1. Dutch elm disease fungus.
2. The elm bark beetles that carry Dutch elm disease fungus.
3. Oak wilt fungus.
4. Emerald ash borers.
B. State Statutes Adopted: Except as modified herein, the council hereby adopts by reference Minnesota statutes chapter 18G, and all
amendments thereto, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the commissioner of agriculture.
C. Control Zones: By resolution, the council shall establish control zones in the city within which the control and abatement procedures for
Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, and emerald ash borers shall apply. Areas outside the established control zones shall not be subject to the
control and abatement procedures herein set forth. The council may from time to time change the control zones. (Ord. 1217, 8-9-2010)

failure to do so, the forester may, cause the infected tree or wood to be sprayed, removed, burned, disposed of or otherwise effectively
treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the spread of the Dutch elm disease fungus, the oak wilt fungus, the elm bark
beetles and/or emerald ash borers. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance with current technical and expert
opinions and plans as may be designated by the commissioner of agriculture and shall be termed proper disposal.

bark beetles, or emerald ash borers exist in any tree or wood in the control zones, the procedure shall be as follows:
1. Notice To Abate: For hazardous wood or hazardous trees and portions found on private property, the property owner shall be given no
more than fourteen (14) days for proper disposal from the date of notification. Within said fourteen (14) days, the property owner shall
complete proper disposal of the nuisance. Notification shall be given in writing and shall be made either by personal service on the
landowners and occupants or by mailing the written notice to them. If service is by mail, the owners shall be those shown on the records

trees and portions) by the property owner within the time limit stated shall authorize the city forester to have the nuisance abated. The
city may then charge all costs of abatement to the property owner and bill him directly. If the landowner does not pay the bill, the monies
due may be assessed. Failure by the property owner to abate the nuisance within the time specified above is a violation of this chapter
and shall be punishable as a misdemeanor. Further, the city may enforce this chapter by injunction or by any other legal remedy.
3. Record Of Costs: The forester shall keep a record of the costs of abatements done under this section and shall report monthly to the

4. Assessment Of Costs: On or before September 1 of each year, the clerk and finance department shall list the total unpaid charges for
each abatement against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable under this chapter. The council may then spread the
charges or any portion thereof against the property involved as a special assessment under Minnesota statutes section 429.101 and
other pertinent statutes for certification to the county auditor and collection the following year along with current taxes.
C. Payment Of Abatement Costs: The payment of monies owed to the city for the abatement of nuisances (as described in subsection 5-8-4A

5-9-6: ENFORCEMENT AND ABATEMENT OF PUBLIC NUISANCES ON PROPERTY:
A. Abatement Process:
1. Notice: Whenever, following an inspection, the enforcement officer determines that a public nuisance on property exists or is being
maintained on property, the enforcement officer must give written notification to the property owner and occupant or other responsible
party of that fact and order that the public nuisance on property be terminated and abated. Notice must be served in person or by
certified mail. Failure of the party to receive the certified mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. Notice to the owner will be
satisfied by notice to the person listed as the taxpayer on the county's tax records. If the property is not occupied, the owner is unknown,
or no other responsible party can reasonably be identified, notice may be served by posting it on the property for a period of at least
seventy two (72) hours. The notice must state:
a. The property location of the public nuisance on property;
b. The nature of the public nuisance on property, with reference to the appropriate code provision;
c. The steps to be taken to abate the public nuisance on property and a reasonable amount of time within which the public nuisance on
property is to be abated, which shall not be less than seven (7) business days after the date of the notice;
d. That if the owner, occupant, or other responsible party does not comply with the notice within the time specified, the city may provide
for abating the public nuisance on property;
e. That the owner, occupant, or other responsible party has the right to appeal the designation as a public nuisance on property by
submitting a request in writing to the city clerk before the date by which abatement must be completed or within seven (7) calendar
days after service of the notice, whichever comes first; and
f. That the city may assess its costs for abatement of the public nuisance on property against the property in accordance with this
section.
2. Authority To Abate: If no timely appeal is submitted and the public nuisance on property is not abated within the deadline given, the
enforcement officer may proceed to abate the public nuisance on property. If the owners or responsible parties deny access to the
property for abatement of the public nuisance on property, the enforcement officer shall then obtain an administrative search warrant or
other judicial order to proceed with enforcement of this chapter. If any material derived from the abatement is salvageable, the city may
sell the salvaged material at private or public sale with the proceeds from the sale being used to offset the cost of abatement. Any
proceeds in excess of the cost of abatement will be paid over to the owners.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 201/526
3. Appeal: If a timely appeal is submitted, the matter must be scheduled for a hearing before the city council. A notice of the hearing must
state the date, time, and location of the city council hearing, must be served in the same manner as the abatement notice, and must be
given at least ten (10) days before the hearing. After holding the hearing, the city council may issue an order requiring abatement of the
public nuisance on property. Any enforcement action and any abatement action will be suspended until seven (7) business days after
the council's written decision has been sent by first class mail and either personally served upon or sent by certified mail to the
appellant, the owners and the responsible parties in apparent control of the property.
4. Cost Of Abatement: If the city performs the work pursuant to this section, the city will maintain a record showing the cost of the work
attributable to abatement of the public nuisance on property, including administrative costs. Abatement costs shall include, but are not
limited to, the cost of the abatement, the cost of investigation, such as title searches, inspections and testing, the cost of notification,
filing costs, attorney fees and administrative costs, including an overhead charge of up to twenty five percent (25%) for administrative
costs. As soon as the abatement work has been completed and the cost determined, the city clerk shall prepare and send by first class
mail an invoice to the owner and/or responsible party setting forth the amount of expenses and charges for such work, which amount is
due and payable to the city within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. The owner of property on which a public nuisance on property
has been abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property not owned by that person, is personally liable to
the city for the cost of the abatement, including all interest, attorney fees, administrative costs and other charges. Unpaid charges
constitute a lien against the property where the abatement occurred on and after the date they were incurred.
5. Special Assessments Under Minnesota Statutes Section 429.101: If the public nuisance on property is of any of the following types:
a. A public health or safety hazard on property excluding any structure included under the provisions of Minnesota statutes section
463.15 to 463.26;
b. Weeds or tall grass violations under subsection 5-9-4D of this chapter;
c. Any other situations or abatements listed under Minnesota statutes section 429.101 for which special assessments may be levied;
then, in such instances, if the property owner does not abate the public nuisance on property and if the city does abate the public
nuisance on property, then the city, following Minnesota statutes section 429.101, may specially assess all the costs of abatement
identified in subsection A4 of this section against the property.
6. Special Assessments Under Minnesota Statutes Section 429.031 And 429.061: If the following circumstances exist:
a. The property owner has not abated the public nuisance on property;
b. The city intends to abate the public nuisance on property and to specially assess the property for the cost of abatement;
c. The abatement is not of a type that falls within the scope of subsection A5 of this section;
then, in such instances, the city, prior to commencement of the abatement, shall follow Minnesota statutes section 429.021,
subdivision 1(8) and 429.031 to authorize the abatement and after the abatement, the city shall follow Minnesota statutes section
429.061 to levy the special assessment for the abatement.
7. Emergency Procedure; Summary Enforcement: In cases of emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the procedure
and notice requirements as set forth in this subsection A will permit a continuing public nuisance on property to unreasonably endanger
public health, safety, or welfare, the city council may order summary enforcement and abate the public nuisance on property. To proceed
with summary enforcement, the enforcement officer or other designated official shall first determine that a public nuisance on property

FEEDING OF DEER
5-10-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
The city council finds that feeding of deer contributes to a high deer density in the city which in turn causes a threat to the public health, safety
and welfare. The high deer density has resulted in damage to landscapes and damage to the understory of wooded areas. Further, the high
deer density causes an increased potential for accidents between vehicles and deer and increased potential for contact with deer ticks that
could result in Lyme disease. Prohibiting the feeding of deer in the urban developed areas will lessen the deer population in those areas by
reducing the number of deer concentration sites. (Ord. 1267, 5-13-2013)
5-10-2: PROHIBITION OF FEEDING DEER:
Within that portion of the city designated as the prohibited deer feeding area on the map attached to the ordinance codified herein, no person
shall engage in the feeding of deer or allow the feeding of deer on that person's property. The map is on file with the city clerk and is hereby
incorporated by reference and made a part of this section.
For purposes of this section, feeding of deer shall mean that the following circumstances have occurred:
A. Providing salt blocks, birdseed mixtures, grain, fruits, vegetables, nuts, hay or other edible material;
B. In a manner that attracts or is designed to attract deer on a regular basis;
provided, however, feeding of deer does not include any of the following:
1. Providing living food sources, such as fruit trees, growing crops or other live vegetation; or
2. Providing birdseed mixtures, grain, fruits, vegetables, nuts, or other edible material in a birdfeeder that is designed to preclude deer
access to the storage space within the birdfeeder; or
3. Providing birdseed mixtures, grain, fruits, vegetables, nuts, or other edible material located at a height more than five feet (5') above the
ground; or
4. Leaving in or on top of the ground, crops or other vegetation that have been spoiled or killed by frost conditions; or
5. Placing or allowing to be kept on the ground, any combination of birdseed mixtures, grains, fruits, vegetables or nuts in a total aggregate
amount of less than four (4) pounds at any one time; there shall not be more than one such feeding location per tax parcel. (Ord. 1267,
5-13-2013)
5-10-3: EXCEPTIONS:
The prohibition contained in section 5-10-2 of this chapter shall not apply to veterinarians or governmental game officials, who in the course of
their duties have deer in their custody or under their management. Further, the prohibition contained in section 5-10-2 of this chapter shall not
apply to a Minnesota department of natural resources deer management program approved by the city council. (Ord. 1267, 5-13-2013)
5-10-4: PENALTY:
A violation of section 5-10-2 of this chapter shall be a petty misdemeanor. (Ord. 1267, 5-13-2013)

shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
1. The violation of any material provision of the right of way permit;
2. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right of way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or
deceit upon the city or its citizens;
3. Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right of way permit;
4. The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due
to reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
5. The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on a written notice issued pursuant to
subsection 7-3-15E of this chapter.
B. Written Notice Of Breach: If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such
violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated in
subsection A of this section, will allow the city to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
C. Response To Notice: Within a time established by the director following permittee's receipt of notification of the breach, the permittee shall
provide the city with a plan to cure the breach, acceptable to the city. The permittee's failure to submit a timely and acceptable plan, or the
permittee's failure to timely implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
D. Reimbursement Of City Costs: If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with such revocation. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-
2008)
7-3-8: SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS:
A. Limitation On Area: A right of way permit is valid only for the area of the right of way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee who determines that an area greater than that specified
in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must, before working in that greater area: 1) make application for a permit extension and
pay any additional fees required thereby; and 2) be granted a new permit or permit extension.
B. Limitation On Dates:
1. A right of way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin work before the permit start date or,
except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. Except in the case of verbal extensions, if a permittee does not finish the
work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension
of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
2. If the obstruction or excavation of the right of way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall
notify the city by supplementary application of the accurate information as soon as this information is known. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-9: OTHER OBLIGATIONS:
A. Compliance With Other Laws: Obtaining a right of way permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all

seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
C. Interference With Right Of Way: A permittee shall not so obstruct a right of way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with, unless otherwise approved by the director. Private vehicles of those doing work in the
right of way may not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading or
unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit.
D. Traffic Control: A permittee shall implement traffic control measures in the area of the work and shall use traffic control procedures in
accordance with the most recent manuals on uniform traffic control, traffic control devices and traffic zone layouts published by the state of
Minnesota.
E. Trenchless Excavation: As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but not
limited to, horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in Minnesota statutes chapter 216D and Minnesota rules
chapter 7560, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the
director. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-10: ROUTINE OBSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION:
Routine excavations and obstructions are permitted without separate notice and separate compensation for such projects. Projects that do not
involve excavation of paved surface and that last less than a continuous eight (8) hour period in duration between seven o'clock (7:00) A.M.
and seven o'clock (7:00) P.M., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, may, in the director's discretion, be considered routine obstruction
and excavation and include, by way of example, switching, replacing fuses, replacing transformers, placing line guards, animal protection,
leak surveys, anode installations and inspections, or to repair facilities due to public damage or accident. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-11: DILIGENCE IN PERFORMING WORK; DELAY PENALTY:
Work shall progress in an expeditious manner as permitted by weather conditions until completion in order to avoid unnecessary
inconvenience. In the event that the work is not performed in accordance with applicable regulations, excavations and utility connections, or
the work is not done in an expeditious manner, or is abandoned without due cause, the city may, after seventy two (72) hours' notice to the
permit holder, correct and fill the excavation or repair the street. The entire cost of such work shall be paid by the permit holder upon demand
made by the city. In accordance with Minnesota rule 7819.1000, subpart 3, the city shall establish and impose a delay penalty for
unreasonable delays in right of way excavation, obstruction, patching, or restoration. The delay penalty shall be established from time to time
by city council resolution. A delay penalty will not be imposed for delays due to force majeure, including inclement weather, civil strife, acts of
God, or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)

J. Installation of pipe (utility conductors) under concrete or bituminous pavements shall be done by jacking, auguring or tunneling as directed
by the director unless otherwise authorized.
K. All backfilling must be placed in six inch (6") layers at optimum moisture and compacted with the objective of attaining one hundred percent
(100%) of standard proctor density. Compaction shall be accomplished with hand, pneumatic or vibrating compacters, as appropriate.
L. No metal tracked or other lugged equipment is allowed to be driven on the public right of way. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-13: INSPECTIONS:
A. Site Inspection: Permittee shall make the work site available to the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
B. Authority Of Director:
1. At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health,
safety or well being of the public.
2. The director may issue an order to the permittee to correct any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or code. If the work failure is a "substantial breach", within the meaning of Minnesota statutes section 237.163,
subdivision 4(c), the order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit after a specified period
determined by the director. The permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected within the time period
set forth by the director in the order. Such proof shall be provided no later than the next business day following the day of completion. If
such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to section 7-3-7-10 of this
chapter. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-14: WORK WITHOUT PERMIT:
A. Emergency Situations:
1. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The
registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators' notification to state gopher
one call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two (2) business days after the occurrence of the
emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
2. If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of
each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to
respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
B. Nonemergency Situations: Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or
excavates a right of way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the
other fees required by this code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right of way, and comply with all of
the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-15: INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right of way shall be done in conformance with
Minnesota rules 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the Minnesota
statutes sections 237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minnesota rules chapter 7560
and this chapter. Service lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable
permits and/or agreements referenced in subsection 7-3-17B of this chapter. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-16: PATCHING AND RESTORATION OF RIGHT OF WAY:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 227/526
A. Timing: The work to be done under the utility permit, and the patching and restoration of the right of way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances
beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under subsection 7-3-9B of this chapter
or if the permittee is granted a new permit.
B. Performing Work: Permittee must patch its own work. The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the surface and subgrading
portions of right of way or to restore the surface portion of right of way itself.
1. Permittee Restoration: If the permittee restores the right of way itself, it shall, at the time of application for a utility permit, post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of section 7-3-7-4 of this chapter, and Minnesota rules 7819.3000.
2. City Restoration: If the city restores the surface portion of right of way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within thirty (30) days of
billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement settles or otherwise fails for reasons not caused by the city's failure to properly
restore, the permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the defective work.
3. Degradation Fee In Lieu Of Restoration: In lieu of right of way restoration, a right of way user may elect to pay a degradation fee.
However, the right of way user shall remain responsible for replacing and compacting the subgrade and aggregate based material in the
excavation, and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
C. Standards: The permittee shall perform patching and restoration according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and
shall comply with Minnesota rules 7819.1100. In exercising authority over restoration, the director shall be guided by the following
standards and considerations:
1. The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the right of way;
2. The traffic volume carried by the right of way and the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right of way;
3. The preexcavation condition of the right of way and the remaining life expectancy of the right of way affected by the excavation;
4. Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right of way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right of way; and
5. The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right of way that would
otherwise take place.
D. Duty To Correct Defects: The permittee shall correct defects in patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. Upon
notification from the city, permittee shall correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the director, said work shall be commenced within two (2) days of receipt of the notice from the city and shall be
completed within fourteen (14) days of commencement of work, not including days during which work cannot be done because of
circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under subsection 7-3-9B of this
chapter.
E. Failure To Restore: If the permittee fails to restore the right of way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the city shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific alleged
failure or failures and shall allow the permittee five (5) days from receipt of said written notice to cure said failure or failures, unless
otherwise extended by the director. In the event the permittee fails to cure, the city may, at its option, perform the necessary work, and the
permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right of way. If the permittee fails to pay as required,
the city, in addition to other remedies provided by law, may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-
2008)
7-3-17: MAPPING DATA:
A. Information Required: Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minnesota
rules 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within ninety (90) days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide
the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the as built location of all equipment installed, owed, and maintained by the permittee.
Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent
with the city's electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's registration.
B. Service Laterals: All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota rules
7560.0150, subpart 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service
laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors
shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subsection
and with applicable state gopher one call law and Minnesota rules governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2007, shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for: 1) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those under
Minnesota statutes chapter 429; and 2) city approval of performance under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan
approval under Minnesota statutes chapter 462. The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 228/526
information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of
the permit issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-18: UNDERGROUNDING:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public and is intended to foster: 1) safe
travel over the right of way; 2) nontravel related safety around homes and buildings where overhead feeds are connected; and 3) orderly
development in the city. Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of facilities in the right of way or in or on other public ground
must be made in accordance with this section and is intended to be enforced consistently with state and federal law regulating right of way
users, specifically including, but not limited to, Minnesota statutes sections 161.45, 237.162, 237.163, 301B.01, 222.37, 238.084 and
216B.36 and the telecommunications act of 1996, title 47, USC section 253.
B. New Facilities: Facilities newly installed, constructed or otherwise placed in the public right of way or in other public property held in
common for public use must be located and maintained underground pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter and in
accordance with applicable construction standards, subject to the exceptions below. Aboveground installation, construction, modification,
or replacement of meters, gauges, transformers, street lighting, pad mount switches, capacitor banks, reclosers and service connection
pedestals shall be allowed. These requirements shall apply equally outside of the corporate limits of the city coincident with city jurisdiction
of platting, subdivision regulation or comprehensive planning as may now or in the future be allowed by law.
C. Permanent Replacement, Relocated Or Reconstructed Facilities: If the city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in subsection A
of this section would be promoted, the city may require a permanent replacement, relocation or reconstruction of a facility to be located
and maintained underground, with due regard for seasonal working conditions. For purposes of this subsection, "reconstruction" means
any substantial repair of or any improvement to existing facilities. Undergrounding may be required whether a replacement, relocation or
reconstruction is initiated by the right of way user owning or operating the facilities, or by the city in connection with: 1) the present or
future use by the city or other local governmental unit of the right of way or other public ground for a public project; 2) the public health or
safety; or 3) the safety and convenience of travel over the right of way. Subject to subsection D of this section, all relocations from
previously placed underground facilities shall be to another underground location.
D. Exceptions: The following exceptions to the strict application of this section shall be allowed upon the conditions stated:
1. Technical/Economic Feasibility; Promotion Of Policy: Aboveground installation, construction, or placement of facilities shall be allowed in
residential, commercial and industrial areas where the council, following consideration and recommendation by the planning
commission, finds that:
a. Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon the landowner, rate payer, or right of way user, or would deprive
the landowner of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights; or
b. Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which
adversely affect underground facilities placement; or
c. Failure to promote the purposes of undergrounding. The right of way user clearly and convincingly demonstrates that none of the
purposes under subsection A of this section would be advanced by underground placement of facilities on the project in question, or
the city determines on its own review that undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances of the proposed
undergrounding.
2. Temporary Service: Aboveground installation, construction, or placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed:
a. During new construction of any project for a period not to exceed three (3) months.
b. During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property within the city.
c. For a period of not more than seven (7) months when soil conditions make excavation impractical.
E. Developer Responsibility: All owners, platters, or developers are responsible for complying with the requirements of this section and, prior
to final approval of any plat or development plan, shall submit to the director written instruments from the appropriate right of way users
showing that all necessary arrangements with said users for installation of such facilities have been made. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-19: LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
A. Compliance With State Regulations: Placement, location and relocation of facilities must comply with the act, with other applicable rights of
the city under its police power, and with Minnesota rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit
authority otherwise available to cities.
B. Relocation Notification Procedure: The director shall notify the utility owner at least three (3) months in advance of the need to relocate
existing facilities so the owner can determine if relocation or replacement is required and plan any required work. The city should provide
one notification, provide the date work will start on the city's project and, if different, provide the date by which the relocation must be
completed. To the extent technically feasible and limited by seasonal constraints, all utilities shall be relocated within one month or in a
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 229/526
time frame determined by the director. The director may allow a different schedule if it does not interfere with the city's project. The utility
owner shall diligently work to relocate the facilities within the above schedule.
C. Delay To City Project: If the owner fails to meet the relocation schedule due to circumstances within the utility's control, the city may charge
the utility owner for all costs incurred by the city because the relocation is not completed in the scheduled time frame.
D. Joint Trenching: All facilities shall be placed in appropriate portions of right of way so as to cause minimum conflict with other underground
facilities. When technically appropriate and no safety hazards are created, all utilities shall be installed, constructed or placed within the
same trench. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gas and electric lines shall be placed in conformance with Minnesota rules part 7819.5100,
subpart 2, governing safety standards.
E. Corridors:
1. The city may assign a specific area within the right of way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will be located within the right of way. All utility, obstruction, or other
permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at
issue. A typical cross section of the location for utilities may be on file at the director's office. This section is not intended to establish
"high density corridors".
2. Any registrant who has facilities in the right of way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city may remain at that
location until the city requires facilities relocation to the corridor pursuant to relocation authority granted under Minnesota rules
7819.3100 or other applicable law.
F. Limitation Of Space: To protect the public health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the right of way and its current use, the
city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right of way. In making such decisions,
the city shall strive, to the extent possible, to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily
by considerations of the public interest, the public needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right of way, and future city plans for public improvements and
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-20: PREEXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION:
In addition to complying with the requirements of Minnesota statutes sections 216D.01 to 216D.09 (one call excavation notice system) before
the start date of any right of way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall be responsible
to mark the horizontal placement of all said facilities, to the extent technically feasible. To the extent its records contain such information, each
registrant shall provide information regarding the approximate vertical location of its facilities, at the time of installation, to excavators upon
request. Nothing in this section is meant to limit the rights, duties and obligations of the facility owners or excavators as set forth in Minnesota
statutes sections 216D.01 to 216D.09. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-21: INTERFERENCE BY OTHER FACILITIES:
When the city does work in the right of way, in its governmental right of way management function, and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a registrant's facilities to carry out the work without damaging the registrant's facilities, the city shall notify the local representative as
early as is reasonably possible. The city costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within thirty (30) days from
the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right of way which it or its facilities damage.
(Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-22: VACATION OF RIGHT OF WAY:
A. Reservation Of Right: If the city vacates a right of way which contains the equipment of a registrant, and if the vacation does not require the
relocation of registrant facilities and equipment, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all registrants having facilities and equipment in
the vacated right of way, the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities and equipment in the vacated right of way and to enter upon
such right of way at any time for the purpose of reconstruction, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.
B. Relocation Of Equipment: If the vacation requires the relocation of registrant facilities and equipment, and: 1) if the vacation proceedings
are initiated by the registrant, the registrant must pay the relocation costs; or 2) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city and the registrant; or 3) if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by a person or persons other than the registrant or permit holder, such other person or persons must pay the relocation costs.
(Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-23: INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY:
By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 230/526
accordance with the provisions of Minnesota rules 7819.1250. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-24: ABANDONED FACILITIES:
A. Discontinued Operations: A registrant who has decided to discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide information
satisfactory to the city that the registrant's obligations for its facilities in the right of way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
B. Removal: Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right of way shall remove them from that right of way pursuant to Minnesota
rules 7819.3300, unless the requirement is waived by the director. A facility is not abandoned unless declared so by the operator. (Ord.
1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-25: APPEALS:
A right of way user that: a) has been denied registration; b) has been denied a permit; c) has had a permit revoked; d) believes that the fees
imposed are not in conformity with Minnesota statutes section 237.163, subdivision 6; or e) disputes a determination of the director regarding
subsection 7-3-17B of this chapter may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed, upon written request, by the city
council. The city council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the city council affirming
the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
(Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-26: RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS:
A permittee's or registrant's rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-27: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any court
or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision, and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. If a regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine,

circumstances at the time they were used, may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future. However, the city has determined
that it is now necessary and desirable to amend and refine the method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing,
operating, maintaining and improving the water system through the imposition of charges as provided in this chapter.
b. In imposing fees and charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the water system in portions of the city, past methods of recovering water system costs, and the
factors set forth in the utilities act, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for the future costs of
constructing, operating, maintaining and improving the water system primarily based on the methodology described in this chapter.
c. The city has further determined that the water system has yet to be constructed in the northwest area, and it is just and equitable to
impose charges for construction, maintenance and operation of the water system on a different basis in the northwest area compared
to the balance of the city where portions of the water system have been financed through special assessments.
d. Assigning costs and making charges for the water system in both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with
mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon analysis of the factors
described in this chapter.
e. To ensure that charges for the water system are just and equitable, the city has further determined to impose fees for connection to
the city water utility system to pay for the construction, reconstruction, repair, enlargement, improvement, or other obtainment, the
maintenance, operation and use of the facilities, and of obtaining and complying with permits required by law. The fee to be charged
for a connection to the water system shall be used for defraying the cost to the city of the following:
(1) The cost to the city for making any and all necessary inspections of such connection.
(2) The cost to the city for repair of any street or roadway caused by or resulting from such connection.
(3) The cost to the city for the installation of the service line running from the main to the stop box and the cost of installing the stop
box.
(4) The charge on a proportionate basis of the cost to the city of acquiring the core facilities of the city water system determined on a
uniform and nondiscriminatory basis allocated on the basis of water consumed (including by reference to the size of water system
facilities serving the subject property), by reference to a reasonable classification of the types of premises to which water service is
furnished (including classifications based on the expected density of such premises), on an SAC unit basis (including by reference
to density of such units), or any other equitable basis including a combination of the foregoing equitable basis. "Core facilities" as
that term is used herein shall be deemed to include the wells, water towers, water mains and water trunk lines of or for the water
system, and costs of core facilities include debt service and related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city
to finance such improvements, depreciation, a reasonable reserve for capital replacement, and the costs of obtaining and complying
with permits required by law.
(5) The city has further determined that it is fair and equitable, in light of the city's long term and ongoing costs of acquisition,
maintenance and repair of the water system, to impose connection fees payable in part at the time property is platted or building
permits are issued, whichever occurs first, and in part payable at the time when building permits are issued or when connection is
made to the water system, whichever occurs first, and further that fees payable in the northwest area compared to the balance of
the city may take into consideration the additional costs of installing the water system in the northwest area.
2. Fees, Amounts: Water system connection fees, including the timing and manner of payment, shall be specified in section 3-4-2-2 of this
code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, such connection fees are in addition to and separate from rates for the
use of water imposed under subsection 8-2-10A of this chapter.
3. Relationship To Special Assessments: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the city may determine that it is just and
equitable to finance the capital costs of water system improvements in the northwest area or elsewhere in the city through special
assessments under Minnesota statutes, chapter 429, provided that the city reasonably determines that the capital costs so financed are
not otherwise financed from connection fees collected under this chapter. (Ord. 1154, 6-11-2007)
E. Notice And Time For Connections:

3. Size And Slope: The size and slope of the building sewers shall be subject to the approval of the plumbing inspector, but in no event
shall the diameter be less than four inches (4"). The slope of such four inch (4") pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch (1/8") per
foot. A slope of one-fourth inch (1/4") per foot shall be used wherever practical.
4. Elevation; Excavations: Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor.
The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open
trench work unless otherwise approved by the inspector. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with the ASTM
specification (designation C12), except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected by the plumbing inspector or his
representative.
5. Lifts: In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drains shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. No water operated sewage ejector shall be used.
6. Location Of Connection, Excavation And Pipe Laying:
a. The connection of the building sewer into the sanitary sewer system shall be made at the wye branch designated for that property.
The sewer stub at the street right of way, or wye, shall be located prior to any extension of the building sewer. The trench for the
house connection shall be dug in a straight line from the wye connection in the street to the structure.
b. Any connection made to the sanitary sewer at other than an existing wye branch shall be as directed by the director of public works or
his authorized representative. (1974 Code § 710.23)
F. Excavation Work: All connections or installation work or repair of connections to the sewer systems including grades, bends and backfilling
shall be performed under the direction and supervision of the plumbing inspector and only by persons duly licensed by the city to perform
such work. No such work shall be covered or backfilled until directed by the inspector. All such work and excavations shall be protected by
barricades and warning markers and lights reasonable and suitable to the purpose. All street excavations shall be filled and compacted as
directed by the plumbing inspector. (1974 Code § 710.11)
G. Inspections: The plumbing inspector shall examine all applications before construction is begun, and after the construction, enlargement,
alteration, repair or connection is complete, the plumbing inspector shall be notified. It shall be unlawful to cover any connecting line until
an inspection has been made and such connection and the work incident thereto has been approved by the city as a proper and suitable
connection. (1974 Code § 710.07)
8-4-5: FEES:
A. Basis Of Fees:
1. The sanitary sewer system, as constructed to date, heretofore has been financed and paid for primarily through a combination of special
assessments levied against benefited property and connection charges. Such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances
at the time they were used, may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future. However, the city has determined that it is now
necessary and desirable to amend and refine the method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing, operating,
maintaining and improving the sanitary sewer system through the imposition of charges as provided in this chapter.
2. In imposing fees and charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the sanitary sewer system in portions of the city, past methods of recovering sanitary sewer system
costs, and the factors set forth in the utilities act, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for the future
costs of constructing, operating, maintaining and improving the sanitary sewer system primarily based on the methodology described in
this chapter.
3. The city has further determined that the sanitary sewer system has yet to be constructed in the northwest area, and it is just and
equitable to impose charges for construction, maintenance and operation of the sanitary sewer system on a different basis in the
northwest area compared to the balance of the city where portions of the sanitary sewer system have been financed through special
assessments.
4. Assigning costs and making charges for the sanitary sewer system in both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be
done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon analysis of the factors
described in this chapter.
5. To ensure that charges for the sanitary sewer system are just and equitable, the city has further determined to impose fees for
connection to the city sanitary sewer utility system to pay for the construction, reconstruction, repair, enlargement, improvement, or other
obtainment, the maintenance, operation and use of the facilities, and of obtaining and complying with permits required by law. The fee to
be charged for a connection to the sanitary sewer system shall be used for defraying the cost to the city of the following:
a. The cost to the city for making any and all necessary inspections of such connection.
b. The cost to the city for repair of any street or roadway caused by or resulting from such connection.
c. The cost to the city for the installation of the service line running from the main to the "wye" branch in accordance with subsection 8-4-
4E of this chapter.
d. The charge on a proportionate basis of the cost to the city of acquiring the core facilities of the city sanitary sewer system determined
on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis allocated on the basis of water consumed, by reference to a reasonable classification of the
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 246/526
types of premises to which sanitary sewer service is furnished (including classifications based on the expected density of such
premises), on an SAC unit basis (including by reference to the density of such units), by reference to the quantity, pollution qualities
and difficulty of disposal of sewage produced (including by reference to the size of sanitary sewer service facilities serving the subject
property), or any other equitable basis including a combination of the foregoing equitable basis, but excluding an allocation by
reference to the square footage of the property charged (except to the extent square footage is relevant to calculation of the density of
premises and/or SAC units to be served). "Core facilities" as that term is used herein shall be deemed to include all mains, trunk lines
and lift stations of or for the sanitary sewer system, and costs of core facilities include debt service and related financing costs in
connection with obligations issued by the city to finance such improvements, depreciation, a reasonable reserve for capital
replacement, and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by law.
6. The city has further determined that it is fair and equitable, in light of the city's long term and ongoing costs of acquisition, maintenance
and repair of the sanitary sewer system, to impose connection fees payable in part at the time property is platted or building permits are
issued, whichever occurs first, and in part payable at the time when building permits are issued or when connection is made to the
sanitary sewer system, whichever occurs first, and further that fees payable in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city
may take into consideration the additional costs of installing the sanitary sewer system in the northwest area.
B. Fees, Amounts: Sanitary sewer connection fees, including the timing and manner of payment, shall be specified in section 3-4-2-2 of this
code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, such connection fees are in addition to and separate from rates for the use
of the sanitary sewer system imposed under section 8-4-6 of this chapter.
C. Relationship To Special Assessments: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the city may determine that it is just and
equitable to finance the capital costs of sanitary sewer system improvements in the northwest area or elsewhere in the city through special
assessments under Minnesota statutes, chapter 429, provided that the city reasonably determines that the capital costs so financed are
not otherwise financed from connection fees collected under this chapter. (Ord. 1154, 6-11-2007)

ground water of any type or kind, or water discharged from any air conditioning unit or system. (1974 Code § 710.13)
B. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any city sewer any harmful waters or wastes, whether liquid, solid or gas, capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the sewage works, or other
interference with the proper operation of the sewage works. (1974 Code § 710.25)
8-4-8: HARMFUL WASTES; PRELIMINARY TREATMENT:
The admission into the sewer system of any waters or wastes having harmful or objectionable characteristics shall be subject to the review
and approval of the director of public works, who may prescribe limits on the strength and character of these waters and wastes. Where
necessary, in the opinion of the director, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to treat
these wastes prior to discharge to the city sewer system. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to proposed
preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the director and of the state commissioner of health, and no construction
of such facilities shall be commenced until approval is obtained in writing. Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or
wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. (1974 Code § 710.25; amd.
2008 Code)
8-4-9: INDUSTRIAL WASTES:
When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install and
maintain at his expense a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods
For The Examination Of Water And Sewage", and shall be determined at the control manhole or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. (1974 Code § 710.25)
8-4-10: INTERCEPTORS:
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the plumbing inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling
of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, and other harmful ingredients, except that such
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 247/526
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. Where installed, they shall be maintained by the owner at his
expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. (1974 Code § 710.25)
8-4-11: RIGHT OF INSPECTION:
The city, by any authorized employee or agent, shall have the right at all reasonable times to enter and be admitted to any lands and property
in the city for the purpose of making inspection of materials, making meter readings, and making inspections of plumbing work and fixtures of
all kinds used by or in connection with the sewer systems. (1974 Code § 710.11)
8-4-12: DAMAGE TO, TAMPERING WITH SYSTEM:
No person shall maliciously, wilfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the sewer system. (1974 Code § 710.15)
8-4-13: IMPLIED CONSENT TO REGULATIONS:
Every person applying for sewer service, every owner of property for which any such application is made, every person accepting sewer
service and every owner of property where such service is accepted subsequent to the effective date hereof shall be deemed, upon making

treatment for food, beverage, or lodging establishments must have at least two feet (2') of vertical separation between the bottom of the
dispersal system and seasonal saturation or bedrock. The vertical separation measurement shall be made outside the area of system
influence in an area of similar soil. (Minnesota rules 7082.0100, subpart 1(D))
B. SSTS built after March 31, 1996, or SSTS located in a shoreland area, wellhead protection area, or serving a food, beverage, or lodging
establishment as defined under Minnesota rules 7080.1100, subpart 84 must have a three foot (3') vertical separation between the bottom
soil infiltrative surface and the periodically saturated soil and/or bedrock. Unless otherwise determined by the department, existing systems
that have no more than a fifteen percent (15%) reduction to the minimum required thirty six inch (36") separation distance are considered
compliant (i.e., a separation distance no less than 30.6 inches). This reduction is to account for settling of sand or soil, normal variation of
separation distance measurements and interpretation of limiting layer characteristics. The vertical separation measurement shall be made
outside the area of system influence in an area of similar soil. (Ord. 1219, 10-25-2010)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 259/526
must be made by a licensed SSTS business hired by the system owner. If the verification separation report consists of verifications by
two (2) independent parties, a subsequent verification is not required unless the inspector has reason to believe a noncompliant
condition exists.
If a documented discrepancy arises on the depth of the periodically saturated soil between licensed businesses or between a licensed
business and the department for SSTS compliance purposes, all disputing parties must follow the dispute resolution procedure
described in Minnesota rules 7082.0700, subpart 5. (Minnesota rules 7082.0100, subpart 3(N))
c. Sewage backup, surface seeping or surface discharge from the system must be determined. A hydraulic function report must be
completed that includes the method(s) used to make the assessment. The assessment must be made by a licensed inspection
business hired by the system owner. A passing report is valid until a new inspection is requested or if the hydraulic performance is
believed to have changed.
3. A certificate of compliance shall be based on the results of the verifications in subsection C2 of this section. The certificate of
compliance must include a certified statement by a licensed inspection business whether the SSTS is in compliance with the chapter
requirements. If the SSTS is determined not to be in compliance with the applicable requirements, a notice of noncompliance must
include a statement specifying those chapter provisions with which the SSTS does not comply. A construction permit application must be
submitted to the department if the required corrective action is not a minor repair.
4. The certificate of compliance or notice of noncompliance must be submitted to the department and the property owner or owner's agent
no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date the inspection was performed. The department shall deliver the certificate of
compliance or notice of noncompliance to the owner or the owner's agent within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt from the licensed
inspection business.

8.
6. The department may waive a compliance inspection required by subsection C1 of this section if:
a. The owner of the real property served by an existing SSTS acknowledges in writing to the department that the existing SSTS is failing
and shall be upgraded, repaired, replaced or abandoned in accordance with this chapter within ten (10) months; or
b. The owner of the real property served by an existing SSTS acknowledges in writing to the department that the existing SSTS is an
imminent threat to public health or safety and shall be upgraded, repaired, replaced or abandoned in accordance with this chapter
within thirty (30) days.
D. Property Transfer/Sale Requirements:
1. No owner or other person acting with legal authority on behalf of an owner of real property served by an existing SSTS may sell or
transfer to another party said real property unless the following requirements are met:
a. A compliance inspection has been performed and a certificate of compliance has been issued for the SSTS within three (3) years if
the SSTS is older than five (5) years or within five (5) years if the SSTS is less than five (5) years old prior to the intended date of sale
or transfer of the real property, unless evidence is found identifying an imminent threat to public health and safety. If this requirement
cannot be met, a compliance inspection must be conducted in accordance with subsection C of this section.
b. The compliance inspection must have been performed following the procedures described in subsection C of this section by the
licensed inspection business hired by the system owner.
c. The seller/transferor of the real property must provide the disclosure required by Minnesota statutes section 115.55, subdivision 6.
d. If the seller/transferor fails to provide a certificate of compliance, the seller/transferor shall provide the buyer/transferee sufficient
security in the form of an escrow agreement to assure the installation of a complying SSTS. The security shall be placed in an escrow
with a licensed real estate closer, licensed attorney, or federal or state chartered financial institution. The amount escrowed shall be
equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of a written estimate to install a complying SSTS provided by a licensed and certified
installer, or the amount escrowed shall be equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the written contract price for the installation of a
complying SSTS provided by a licensed and certified installer. After a complying SSTS has been installed and a certificate of
compliance issued, the seller/transferor or the buyer/transferee shall provide the escrow agent a copy of the certificate of compliance.
2. The compliance portion of the certificate of compliance need not be completed if the sale or transfer involves the following
circumstances:
a. The affected real property is without buildings or contains no dwellings or other buildings with plumbing fixtures.
b. The transfer is a tax forfeiture.
c. The sale or transfer completes a contract for deed or purchase agreement entered into prior to the effective date of this chapter. This
subsection applies only to the original vendor and vendee on such contract.
3. All real property sales or transfers subject to this chapter occurring during the period between November 15 and April 15 when SSTS
compliance cannot be determined due to frozen soil conditions shall require a winter agreement, which includes an application for an
SSTS permit and an agreement to complete a compliance inspection by the following June 1 by a licensed inspection business. If upon
inspection the SSTS is found to be in compliance, the permit fee will be refunded. If upon inspection the system is found to be
noncompliant, an escrow agreement must be established in accordance with subsection D1d of this section and the system upgraded.

4. The responsibility for filing the completed compliance portion of the certificate of compliance under subsection D1 of this section or for
upgrading a system found to be noncompliant shall be determined by the seller/transferor and the buyer/transferee. The seller/transferor
and the buyer/transferee shall provide the department with a signed statement indicating responsibility for completing the compliance
portion of the certificate of compliance and for upgrading a system found to be noncompliant.
5. The issuance of permits, certificates of compliance or notices of noncompliance as requested or issued shall not be construed to
represent a guarantee or warranty of the system's operation or effectiveness. Such certificates signify that the system in question is or
has been designed and installed in compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter.
E. Conflict Of Interest: A licensed inspection business that inspects an existing SSTS is allowed to subsequently design and install a new
SSTS for that property provided the inspection business is also licensed to design and install. A licensed inspection business working on
behalf of a municipality must not design or install a system if there is likelihood that the inspector or business will be responsible for
permitting or inspecting the system or system site. A person working for or on behalf of a municipality shall not use the person's position to
solicit for private business gain. (Minnesota rules 7082.0700, subpart 2(B)) (Ord. 1219, 10-25-2010)

Chapter 7
STORMWATER SYSTEMS
8-7-1: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the meanings given:
NORTHWEST AREA STORMWATER SYSTEM: The stormwater management, control and treatment practices described in the stormwater
management manual for the northwest area.
STORMWATER SYSTEM: The city's storm sewer utility established under this chapter and under the utilities act, which utility is also known as
the stormwater sewer utility system. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
In providing for charges, the following findings and determinations are made:
A. In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated and maintained a stormwater runoff system in portions of the city, and intends to continue to improve, operate and
maintain that system as a stormwater utility under the utility act. This chapter is adopted in the further exercise of such authority.
B. The stormwater system, as constructed to date, heretofore has been financed and paid for primarily through a combination of special
assessments levied against benefited property and the imposition of ad valorem taxes within certain watershed management tax districts
established under Minnesota statutes, section 103B.245. Such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they
were used, may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future. However, the city has determined that it is now necessary and
desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing, operating, maintaining and
improving the stormwater system through the imposition of charges as provided in this chapter.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 273/526
C. In imposing fees and charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the stormwater system in portions of the city, past methods of recovering stormwater system costs, and
the factors set forth in subdivision 3b of the utility act, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for the
future costs of constructing, operating, maintaining and improving the stormwater system primarily based on the methodology described in
this chapter.
D. The city has further determined that the stormwater system has yet to be constructed in the northwest area, and that the stormwater
improvements in that area will be based on the northwest area stormwater system, which includes (without limitation) rain gardens,
infiltration basins, biofiltration trenches and other stormwater management techniques. In light of the northwest area stormwater system
compared to stormwater runoff systems existing in the balance of the city, it is just and equitable to impose charges for construction,
maintenance and operation of the stormwater system on a different basis in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city.
E. Assigning costs and making charges for the stormwater system in both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with
mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon analysis of the factors described
in this chapter.
F. To ensure that charges for the stormwater system are just and equitable, the city has further determined that: 1) the capital cost of future
improvements to the system in the northwest area are most fairly financed through connection fees payable at the time property is platted
or building permits are issued, whichever occurs first; 2) the capital cost of future improvements to the system in the balance of the city
outside the northwest area are most fairly financed through special assessments or watershed management taxes; and 3) the costs for
operation and maintenance of the stormwater system are most fairly financed by operation charges, payable in accordance with other city
utility procedures and at rates reflecting the different levels of operation and maintenance cost of the stormwater system in the northwest
area and the balance of the city. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-3: STORMWATER SYSTEM ESTABLISHED:
A city stormwater system is hereby established. The stormwater system consists of all stormwater conduits, manholes and catch basins,
ditches, ponds within the public right of way and easements and any additional facilities acquired by the city in the future, including, without
limitation, the improvements to be constructed as part of the northwest area stormwater system. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-4: RATES AND CHARGES:
A. Northwest Area Connection Fees: The city may impose a connection fee within the northwest area, based on: 1) the square footage of the
property to be charged, adjusted for a reasonable calculation of stormwater runoff, 2) a reasonable classification of the types of premises
to which service is furnished, 3) by reference to the quantity, pollution qualities, and difficulty of disposal of stormwater runoff produced, or
4) any other equitable basis, including any combination of the basis described in items 1) through 3) of this subsection, but excluding any
reference to the amount of water consumed. The connection fee must be a fair and equitable share of the amount reasonably calculated to
pay total projected capital costs of the northwest area stormwater system constructed as part of the stormwater system within the
northwest area, including the cost of debt service and related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to finance
such improvements, depreciation, a reasonable reserve for capital replacement, and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits
required by law. In determining the connection fee, the city may give consideration to all costs of establishing the system, and of
improvements, enlargements and extensions necessary to serve adequately the northwest area. The connection fee, including timing and
manner of payment, shall be specified in subsection 3-4-2-2G of this code, as amended from time to time.
B. Operation Charges: The city may impose an operation charge on all owners and users of the stormwater system in the city, based on: 1)
the square footage of the property to be charged, adjusted for a reasonable calculation of stormwater runoff, 2) a reasonable classification
of the types of premises to which service is furnished, 3) by reference to the quantity, pollution qualities, and difficulty of disposal of
stormwater runoff produced, or 4) any other equitable basis, including any combination of the basis described in items 1) through 3) of this
subsection, but excluding any reference to the amount of water consumed. The operation charge must be a fair and equitable share of the
amount reasonably calculated to pay total operation and maintenance costs of the stormwater system. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the operation charge will consist of a minimum charge imposed on all property and users in the city, an additional charge
for property within the northwest area, and an additional charge for property in the balance of the city, recognizing the differential in
operation and maintenance costs in those two (2) portions of the city. The connection fees for the northwest area and the balance of the
city, including timing and manner of payment, shall be specified in section 3-4-2-2 of this code, as amended from time to time.
C. Supplying Information: The owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises must supply the city with such information as the city may
reasonably request related to the use, development and area of the premises and the imposition of any connection fee or operation
charge. Wilful failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a violation of this subsection.
D. Estimated Fees: If the owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises fails or refuses to provide the information requested, as
provided in subsection C of this section, the fee for such premises must be estimated and billed in accordance with such estimate, based
upon information then available to the city.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 274/526
E. Payment And Collection: All connection fees and operation charges imposed under this section are charges against the respective owner,
lessees and occupants, and are due on the due date specified by the city for the respective account, and shall be delinquent thirty (30)
days thereafter. In the event a bill becomes delinquent, the city council may cause the delinquent charges to become a lien against the
property served by certifying to the county auditor the amount of such delinquent bill in accordance with the utility act. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-
2007)
8-7-5: USE OF REVENUES:
Revenues received from connection fees and operation charges are to be placed in a separate stormwater system account and used to pay
the normal, reasonable and current costs of constructing, operating, maintaining, and improving the stormwater system. The city finance
director may establish such funds and subaccounts within the stormwater system account as deemed reasonable and necessary to manage
the stormwater system in accordance with the utility act. Revenues from time to time received in excess of amounts needed to pay costs of
operation and maintenance of the stormwater system, including any operating reserve established within the stormwater system account, may
be used to finance improvements to and betterments of the stormwater system in accordance with the utility act. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-6: RELATIONSHIP TO WATERSHED MANAGEMENT TAX DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the city may determine that it is just and equitable to finance the capital costs of
stormwater system improvements in the northwest stormwater area or elsewhere in the city through the establishment of watershed
management tax districts under Minnesota statutes, section 103B.245, or special assessments under Minnesota statutes, chapter 429,
provided that the city reasonably determines that the capital costs so financed are not otherwise financed from connection fees collected
under this chapter. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)

9-5-2: FINDINGS:
The city of Inver Grove Heights, hereby finds that uncontrolled and unmanaged stormwater and snowmelt runoff can have significant adverse
impacts upon water resources; and can adversely affect the health, safety, property and general welfare of the community, and diminish the
public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, runoff can:
A. Cause erosion to exposed soil resulting in loss of topsoil and deposition of sediments.
B. Carry nutrients, pathogens, organic matter, heavy metals, toxins, and other pollutants to lakes, streams, and wetlands.
C. Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and reduce the natural diversity of plant and
animal life.
D. Clog existing drainage systems, increasing maintenance problems and costs.
E. Cause bank and channel erosion.
F. Increase downstream flooding.
G. Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows and lower water levels in lakes, ponds, and wetlands.
H. Contaminate drinking water supplies.
I. Increase risk of property damage and personal injury.
Further, effective stormwater pollution prevention, addressing the following issues, depends on proper planning and design, the timely
installation and maintenance of site and situation of appropriate best management practices (BMPs), and prompt and appropriate response
upon discovery of previously unknown pollutant sources. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth minimum requirements for managing the quantity and quality of runoff from all types of land uses
throughout the city to achieve the following objectives:
A. Protect, preserve, and use natural surface and ground water storage and retention systems;
B. Improve the quality of stormwater runoff reaching surface water resources within the city and the Mississippi River by reducing nonpoint
source pollution (including sediment) carried as stormwater runoff;
C. Minimize flood damage to residential, business, commercial and public structures and property, and protect against increased flooding
caused by land disturbing activities and other projects;
D. Reduce volumes of stormwater runoff and the amount of impervious surfaces in the developed parts of the city;
E. Limit the rates and volumes, and increase the treatment of stormwater runoff, by managing stormwater runoff as close to its source as
possible and mimicking the system's natural hydrology;
F. Minimize flood damage to residential, business, commercial, and public structures and property, and protect against increased flooding
caused by land disturbing activities and other projects;
G. Minimize erosion and sedimentation;
H. Minimize damage from sediments resulting from eroded soil;
I. Regulate land disturbing activities to protect against erosion and sedimentation;
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 287/526
J. Implement soil protection and sedimentation controls to maintain health, safety, and welfare;
K. Protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and water recreational facilities; and
L. Secure the other benefits associated with proper management of surface and ground water. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-4: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, the words or phrases used in this chapter shall have the same meaning as they have in the "Minnesota
Stormwater Manual" and if not defined there, as they are defined in common usage. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the
present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the
plural number. The words "shall" and "must" are always mandatory and not merely directive.
APPLICANT: Any person or entity that applies for any permit for a project that includes a land disturbing activity. Applicant also means that
person's agents, employees, and others acting under that person's direction.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): Erosion and sediment control and stormwater management practices that are the most effective
and practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing the degradation of surface water, including construction phasing, minimizing
the length of time soil areas are exposed, and other management practices published by state or designated area wide planning agencies.
BMPs include integrated management practices (IMP), which are small scale, distributed, on site stormwater management devices.
Examples of BMPs can be found in the current versions of the "Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual - Northwest Area" (2006), the
Minnesota pollution control agency's "Minnesota Stormwater Manual".
BUFFER: A protective vegetated zone located adjacent to a natural resource, such as a lake, stream or wetland, which is subject to direct or
indirect human alteration. Such a buffer strip is an integral part of protecting an aquatic ecosystem through filtering pollutants and providing
adjacent habitat. For a stream, the width of a buffer strip is the width along each bank of the stream. Therefore, a thirty foot (30') wide stream
with one hundred foot (100') wide buffer strips has a total width of two hundred thirty feet (230'). Buffer vegetation may include preserving
existing predevelopment vegetation and/or planting locally distributed native Minnesota trees, shrubs and grassy vegetation.
CITY PLAN: Any city adopted or approved planning document such as the comprehensive plan, water resources management plan, "Inver
Grove Heights Stormwater Manual - Northwest Area" (2006), land use plan, or other.
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY: A disturbance to the land that results in a change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and
nonvegetative), or the existing soil topography that may result in accelerated stormwater runoff, leading to soil erosion and movement of
sediment into surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of construction activity may include clearing, grading, filling and excavating.
CONVEYANCE: A structure or feature used for transferring water from one location to another.
DESIGN STORM: A rainfall event of specified size and return frequency that is used to calculate the runoff volume and peak discharge rate
and is used to measure the performance of stormwater management practices.
DISCHARGE: The release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage of stormwater, including snowmelt, into a receiving water resource.
DRAINAGEWAYS: Any natural or constructed channel which provides a course for water flowing either continuously or intermittently.
EROSION: Any process that wears away the surface of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can be accelerated by the
activities of people and nature.
EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICE (ESC): The management procedures, techniques, and methods to control soil erosion
and sedimentation.
EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL TECHNICIAN (ESC TECH): For the purposes of construction site erosion and sediment control, the
person or persons designated by the contractor who have successfully completed ESC training from the University Of Minnesota; Minnesota
department of transportation certification; Minnesota Erosion Control Association training; or other training recognized by the MPCA as
meeting the requirements of the NPDES construction stormwater permit.
EROSION CONTROL: Refers to methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading,
temporary or permanent cover, and construction phasing.
EXPOSED SOIL AREAS: All areas of the construction site where the vegetation (trees, shrubs, brush, grasses, etc.) or impervious surface
has been removed, thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion. This includes topsoil stockpile areas, borrow areas and disposal areas
within the construction site. It does not include stockpiles or surcharge areas of gravel, concrete or bituminous. Once soil is exposed it is
considered "exposed soil", until it meets the definition of "final stabilization".
FINAL STABILIZATION: That:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 288/526
A. All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed; and
B. A uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy five percent (75%) of the native background vegetative cover for unpaved
areas has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed.
Simply sowing grass seed is not considered final stabilization.
FLOOD EVENT (100-YEAR): The precipitation or snowmelt runoff event which has a one percent (1%) chance of occurring at a given location
within any one year time period.
FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway.
FLOOD LEVEL (100-YEAR): The peak water surface elevation of an inundation area or basin resulting from a 100-year flood event.
FLOODPLAIN: The areas adjoining a watercourse or water basin that have been or may be covered by a regional flood.
FLOODWAY: The channel of the watercourse, the bed of water basins, and those portions of the adjoining floodplain that are reasonably
required to carry and discharge floodwater and provide water storage during a regional flood.

inlets.
2. Temporary or permanent drainage ditches and sediment basins that are designed as part of a treatment system (e.g., ditches with rock
check dams) require sediment control practices as appropriate for site conditions.
3. In order to maintain sheet flow and minimize rills and/or gullies, there shall be no unbroken slope length of greater than seventy five feet
(75') for slopes with a grade of three to one (3:1) or steeper.

construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased.
5. Sediment control practices must be established on all down gradient perimeters before any up gradient land disturbing activities begin.
These practices shall remain in place until final stabilization has been established.
6. The timing of the installation of sediment control practices may be adjusted to accommodate short term activities such as clearing or
grubbing, or passage of vehicles. Any short term activity must be completed as quickly as possible and the sediment control practices
must be installed immediately after the activity is completed. However, sediment control practices must be installed before the next
precipitation event even if the activity is not complete.

twenty four (24) hours after a rainfall event greater than 0.5 inches in twenty four (24) hours.
3. All inspections and maintenance conducted during construction must be recorded in writing and these records must be retained with the
erosion and sediment control plan.
4. All erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs must be inspected to ensure integrity and effectiveness. All nonfunctional BMPs must
be repaired, replaced, or supplemented with functional BMPs within twenty four (24) hours after discovery, or as soon as field conditions
allow access.
5. The owner and operator are responsible for the operation and maintenance of temporary and permanent water quality management
BMP/IMPs, as well as all erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs, for the duration of the construction work at the site.

surfaces.
2. Pollutant Removal Requirements:
a. For projects that have met the infiltration/volume control requirements above, the pollutant removal requirements are considered to be
met.
b. For projects where infiltration is prohibited or restricted (see subsections A3a and A3b of this section), the following pollutant removal
standards apply prior to site discharge reaching a downstream receiving water: achieve a minimum eighty five percent (85%) removal
of total suspended solids and minimum fifty five percent (55%) removal of total phosphorus.
c. For redevelopment projects, BMPs shall be such that there is a net reduction in phosphorus and total suspended solids loading from
the redevelopment site when compared to the existing (currently developed) site.
d. Where projects propose multiple BMPs in a treatment train approach to meet the pollutant removal requirements, at least fifty percent
(50%) of the project area shall be treated in BMPs located in the upstream areas of the site.
3. LID Or Green Infrastructure Design Concepts: Low impact development (LID), or green infrastructure, design concepts shall be
incorporated into development projects located in the northwest area and in other landlocked basins in the city. In all other parts of the
city, LID design concepts must be implemented wherever possible. Specific LID related requirements for the northwest area and other
landlocked basin areas include:
a. Postdevelopment runoff volume must match predevelopment runoff volume for the 5-year, 24-hour event.
b. Proposed developments must use infiltration rain gardens, vegetated swales, parking lot bioretention, infiltration basins/trenches,
disconnection of impervious surfaces, green roofs, and other LID techniques.
c. Mass grading should be avoided to reduce compaction of natural/open space areas.
d. Joint parking and shared driveway arrangements are encouraged.
e. Pervious materials may be used for parking lot surfaces and are encouraged for single-family residential driveways.
f. Parking lot curbing generally must be flat (ribbon curb) or have breaks at regular intervals (curb cuts) to convey runoff into the
stormwater system.
g. Residential downspouts and sump pumps must discharge to cisterns and/or permeable surfaces. Nonresidential downspouts and
sump pumps must meet this requirement if reasonably possible.
h. Narrower street widths are allowed, with restrictions.

e. Creating a smaller building footprint (e.g., building two-story houses instead of one-story houses).
f. Installing semipermeable/permeable paving, where feasible.
5. Storm Sewer Conveyance Systems: Storm sewer conveyance systems will be designed to provide discharge capacity for the 10-year
frequency runoff event. The city may allow variances to this standard in areas where a new storm sewer system would connect to an
existing storm sewer system that does not have and is not expected in the future to have a ten (10) year capacity. The portions of the
system that convey outflows from ponding areas will be sized to convey the critical 10-year storm flow or the required 100-year outflow
from upstream ponding areas, whichever is greater. The storm sewer systems shall be designed for 10-year storm events and their
performance shall be analyzed for storms exceeding the design storm.
6. Postdevelopment Peak Discharge Rates: Postdevelopment peak discharge rates shall not exceed existing discharge rates for the 2-
year, 5-year, 10-year, and 100-year (50 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, and 1 percent probability), 24-hour duration storm events.

base flows in downstream open channels. Pipes entering wet ponds shall have the invert elevation set 0.5 feet below the pond normal
water level.
10. Culvert Outlet Velocities: For culvert outlet velocities less than or equal to four (4) fps, check shear stress to determine if vegetation or
riprap will be adequate. If vegetation is used, temporary erosion control during and immediately following construction shall be used until
vegetation becomes established. For velocities greater than four (4) fps, energy dissipaters shall be designed in accordance with
MnDOT design criteria.
11. Skimming Devices: The placement of skimming devices at the outlet of all on site detention basins to capture trash and floatable debris
is required.
12. Landlocked Basins: For landlocked basin areas only the existing tributary area will be allowed to discharge to a landlocked basin,
unless provisions have been made for an outlet from the basin. The water quality and flooding impacts of proposed outlets from
landlocked basins on downstream water resources shall be evaluated.
13. LFE Of Structure Adjacent To Inundation Area With Outlet: The lowest floor elevation (LFE) of any structure adjacent to an inundation
area with an outlet shall be at least two feet (2') above the 100-year flood level. For the purposes of this section, "structure" means a
walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage tanks, which are principally above ground. The term includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers on site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.

this section) adjacent to a landlocked basin or inundation area shall meet the following standards and as illustrated in figure 1 of this
section:
a. Scenario 1: Where the 100-year flood level is zero to six feet (6') below the natural overflow elevation (NOF) the LFE shall be the
greater of the 100-year elevation plus two feet (2') or the NOF plus one foot (1'). The NOF must be maintained and an easement
obtained over the NOF.
b. Scenario 2: Where the 100-year flood level is six (6) to eighteen feet (18') below the NOF, the LFE shall be the 100-year elevation
plus six feet (6'). The overflow shall consist of a drop inlet having a minimum pipe diameter of eighteen inches (18") and an invert set
four feet (4') above the 100-year flood level.
c. Scenario 3: Where the 100-year flood level is more than eighteen feet (18') below the NOF, the LFE shall be the 100-year elevation
plus ten feet (10'). The overflow shall include an easement corridor and contingency for a future gravity outlet or lift station outlet.
d. For all landlocked basins, the LFE shall be set at least one foot (1') above the greater of the back to back 100-year storm event and a

C. If site features/BMPs that are implemented to comply with the permanent stormwater requirements change such that a reduction in the
intended design function and capacity is determined by the city, the owner will be required to maintain the BMP to restore the intended
design function and capacity of the BMP, modify the BMP or create a new BMP(s) to ensure that the features/BMPs on site meet the
intended design function and capacity. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-11: PENALTY, ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT OF ENTRY:
A. Penalty: Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this chapter shall be fined as provided in section 1-4-1 of this code, and a
separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
B. Inspection: The director of public works may inspect construction sites for compliance with provisions of this chapter.
C. Notification Of Failure Of The Erosion And Sediment Control Plan Or Stormwater Management Plan:
1. Notification By City: If upon notification by the city of an observed failure of the erosion and sediment control plan or stormwater
management plan measures, the contractor fails to correct the failure within forty eight (48) hours after notification by the city or the time
specified by the city, the city, at its discretion, may begin corrective work.
2. Erosion Off Site: If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan,
obtain the right of entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and restoration plan within forty eight (48) hours
of obtaining the adjoining property owner's permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the city, may more than
seven (7) calendar days go by without corrective action being taken. If in the opinion of the city, the permit holder does not repair the
damage caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required.
3. Erosion/Sediment Deposition Into Streets, Wetlands, Or Water Bodies: The applicant shall immediately clean up and repair any eroded

and repair operations.
4. Failure To Do Corrective Work: When an applicant fails to conform to any provision of this chapter within the time stipulated, the city
may take the following actions:
a. Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
b. Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site in question or any other of the applicant's sites within the city's
jurisdiction.
c. Direct the correction of the deficiency by city staff or by a separate contract. The issuance of a permit constitutes a right of entry for
the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose of correcting deficiencies in the erosion and sediment
controls and stormwater management facilities.
d. All costs incurred by the city in correcting erosion and sediment controls and stormwater management deficiencies shall be
reimbursed by the applicant. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days after costs are incurred by the city, payment will be made
from the applicant's financial securities, as set by other city permits/approvals.
e. If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant's financial securities to cover the costs incurred by the city, then the city may
assess the remaining amount against the property.
D. Notification Of Need For Maintenance, Repair, Or Replacement Of Existing Private Stormwater Facilities Of A Noncritical Nature: If, upon
inspection, the city finds that any private stormwater management facilities require maintenance, repair, or replacement, but such
deficiencies do not create a critical or imminent threat to adjacent properties, the environment, or other stormwater facilities, the party or
parties responsible for the continued operation of the facilities shall be given written notice of the findings, the actions required to correct
the situation, and a timetable by which such activities must be completed. Such parties shall have fifteen (15) days to reply to the city
indicating their response to the notice.
If the responsible party or parties do not complete the necessary activities stipulated by the city public works department, the city, after
notice, may order that such activities be completed by the city or its designated contractor and that all costs associated with such activities
be certified by the director of public works to the council. The amount so charged shall be a lien upon the properties benefiting from and
utilizing the stormwater facilities maintained, repaired or replaced and shall be added to, become, and form part of the taxes next to be
assessed and levied upon such properties. The council shall, by appropriate resolution, assess the above mentioned costs against said
properties, and certify the same to the county. The same shall be collected and enforced in the same manner as the collection of real
estate taxes.
E. Operator Responsibility: The contractor is jointly responsible with the owner for compliance with all portions of the permit and stormwater
management plan prior to final completion of construction activities. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-12: CONFLICTING PROVISIONS:

B. Access To Facilities:
1. The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a discharger has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
2. Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
3. The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
4. The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of

clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
6. Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility are a violation of a stormwater
discharge permit and of this section. A person who is the operator of the facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section.

the city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of any part of this section 9-5-13, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with any part of this
section 9-5-13 or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-

The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial land use shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of structural and
nonstructural BMPs of the MPCA. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be, the source of an illicit
discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the
provisions of this section 9-5-13. The BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance
with the requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)

response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials that are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by telephone or facsimile no later
than the next business day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within
three (3) business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial land use,
the owner or operator of such a land use shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. The city shall keep records of any known illicit discharge on the city's
inspection form. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)

10-3-3: NONCONFORMING USE CERTIFICATE:
A. Purpose: From time to time, amendments to this title cause uses and structures to become lawfully nonconforming. This may create
uncertainties for owners and operators of lawfully nonconforming uses and structures as to their rights and obligations and complexities for
the city in monitoring and enforcing this code with respect to such uses. To address these uncertainties and complexities, the city council,
sitting as a board of adjustments and appeals, by majority vote, may grant nonconforming use certificates for lawfully nonconforming uses
and structures, impose reasonable conditions in the nonconforming use certificates, and authorize accessory uses not currently on the
property to be placed thereon in the future.
B. Application For Certificate: Either an owner may apply, or the city may initiate or require an application for a nonconforming use certificate
for a use and/or a structure. The application shall include at least the following:
1. The address and legal description of the use or structure;
2. The nature of the nonconformity with specific reference to the provision of this code or other circumstance which caused the
nonconformity;
3. Evidence that the use or structure existed as a legal use prior to the effective date hereof or other circumstance which caused the
nonconformity;
4. Evidence that the use or structure has been continuously used and maintained in its nonconforming state from the time the
nonconformity was caused to the date the application was filed;
5. If the use is a prohibited use listed in section 10-13E-7 of this title, the information required under subsection 10-13E-8B of this title; and
6. Other information as requested by the city.
C. Application And Procedure: The application for a nonconforming use certificate shall be filed with the planning division for scheduling
before the planning commission and city council. The city council and the planning commission may hold a public hearing on the
nonconforming use certificate if they deem it necessary or advisable. Where the planning commission or city council shall determine that a
public hearing is necessary or advisable, the application, public hearing, and notice requirements for nonconforming use certificates shall
be the same as for amendments set forth in section 10-3-5 of this chapter.
D. Referral To Planning Commission: Before granting any nonconforming use certificate, the request therefor shall be referred to the planning
commission for review concerning whether the use is a legally nonconforming use and for its recommendation to the city council in
connection with the request. If no recommendation is timely made, the council may act without the recommendation of the planning
commission. The planning commission may recommend such conditions related to the nonconforming use certificate as it may deem
advisable to make clear the rights and obligations of the city and the owner. The council shall approve or deny the application within the
time established by Minnesota statutes section 15.99.
E. Approval Or Denial Of Certificate:
1. The planning commission may recommend to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for a nonconforming use certificate.
The city council, sitting as the board of adjustments and appeals, by majority vote, may deny or approve a nonconforming use
certificate, impose conditions therein, and authorize therein accessory uses not currently on the property to be placed thereon in the
future. The planning commission, in making a recommendation, and the city council, in acting upon a request for a nonconforming use
certificate, shall consider the following factors:
a. Whether under this title the use or structure is nonconforming and how it is nonconforming; and
b. Whether the use or structure was lawful prior to the change in this title, which caused it to become nonconforming.
2. If the city council finds that a use or structure is not a lawful nonconforming use, the city council shall deny the application, and the use
shall be terminated immediately or altered to make it conforming, or the structure shall be altered to make it conforming. Failure to
terminate or alter the use to make it conforming shall be a violation of this title.
F. Record Of Certificate: If the city council grants a nonconforming use certificate, the owner shall record the certificate with the county
recorder and provide evidence of recording to the city. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

10-3-4: VARIANCES:
A. Authority: The council may grant variances from the strict application of the provisions of this title and impose conditions and safeguards in
the variances so granted where practical difficulties or undue hardships result from carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this
title.
B. Application And Procedure: Application for a variance shall be filed with the planning division for scheduling before the planning
commission and city council. The council and planning commission may hold a public hearing on the variance request if they deem it
necessary or advisable. Where the planning commission or city council shall determine that a public hearing is necessary or advisable, the
application, public hearing, notice and procedure requirements for variances shall be the same as for amendments set forth in section 10-
3-5 of this chapter. The city council shall act upon the application within the time limits established by Minnesota statutes section 15.99.
C. Referral To Planning Commission: Before authorization of any variances, the request therefor shall be referred to the planning commission
for study concerning the effect of the proposed variance upon the comprehensive guide plan and on the character and development of the
neighborhood and for its recommendation to the council in connection with such request. The planning commission shall make its
recommendation after the request is referred to it, and if no recommendation is made within that time, the council may act without the
recommendation. The planning commission may recommend such conditions related to the variance regarding the location, character, and
other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
D. Approval Or Denial Of Variance:
1. a. The planning commission may recommend to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for a variance. The city council
may deny or approve such variances and impose conditions and safeguards therein. In making its recommendation, the planning
commission shall consider the following factors and the city council, in acting upon a request for a variance, shall only grant a variance if
the applicant demonstrates to the city council that the following factors have been met:
(1) That circumstances exist that are special and unique to the structure or land under consideration and such circumstances do not
apply generally to other land or structures in the district in which the subject structure or land is located.
(2) That the granting of the application will not be contrary to the spirit and intent of this title and the comprehensive plan.
(3) That the granting of such variance is necessary as a result of a demonstrated undue hardship and will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant. Undue hardship means that all of the following circumstances exist:
(A) The subject property cannot be put to a reasonable, beneficial use unless the variance is granted.
(B) The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the subject property not created by the landowner.
(C) The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
(4) That economic considerations alone do not constitute an undue hardship if reasonable beneficial use for the subject property
exists under the terms of this title.
b. Undue hardship also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
c. A variance shall be granted for earth shelter construction as defined in Minnesota statutes section 216C.06, subdivision 14 when such
construction and variance are in harmony with this title.
d. A variance may not permit any use that is not permitted under this title for property in the zone where the affected person's land is
located.
e. A variance may permit the temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-family dwelling.
f. The council may impose conditions in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties.
g. Approval of a variance shall require a majority of the city council present. (Ord. 1221, 11-8-2010)
2. The council may deny variances, and such denial shall constitute a finding and determination that the conditions required for approval
do not exist.
E. Violation; Termination Of Variance: A violation of any condition set forth in granting a variance shall be a violation of this title and also
automatically terminates the variance.
F. Lapse Of Variance: A variance shall become void two (2) years after it was granted unless made use of within two (2) years or such longer
period as the council, within two (2) years, may provide. The city council may grant a single one year extension, the request for which must
be submitted to the city planning division at least sixty (60) days prior to the date upon which the variance would become void. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)

agricultural, E-1 estate or E-2 estate, the individual notice shall be mailed to each of the property owners within one thousand feet
(1,000'). Failure of the clerk to mail the notice or failure of the property owners to receive the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
The council may waive the above notice requirements in connection with a citywide zoning initiated by the planning commission or
council.
2. The planning commission shall hold said public hearing after the rezoning request has been received and there has been sufficient time
to mail and publish the required notices.

commission's report to the council shall be mailed to the applicant.

proposed amendments to this title without having first referred it to the planning commission for their consideration and recommendation.
F. Action By Council: The council shall approve or deny the application within the time limits set forth in Minnesota statutes section 15.99.
G. Effect Of Denial: The denial of a rezoning or ordinance text amendment application by the council shall constitute a finding and
determination that the proposed rezoning is not in the best interest of the physical development of the city. No application for rezoning
which has been denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months from the date of said denial. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-

to be submitted within ten (10) days.
D. Further Review By Board Of Adjustments And Appeals: At the zoning administrator's discretion, the application may be referred to the
board of adjustments and appeals to make a determination. If referred to the board of adjustments and appeals, notification and hearing
procedures shall be the same as set forth in section 10-3-5 of this chapter.
E. Appeal: If the zoning administrator makes a determination of substantially similar use without referring it to the board of adjustments and
appeals, the applicant may appeal the decision to the board of adjustments and appeals. Prior to a decision by the board of adjustments
and appeals, the planning commission shall consider the matter and make a recommendation on the substantially similar use request.

the board of adjustments and appeals makes the decision on the application, a copy of the meeting minutes shall be kept on file for future
reference.
G. Limitations: The procedures and regulations found in this section shall only apply to those uses found in the nonresidential use table found
in section 10-6-2 of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3-7: BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS AND APPEALS; APPEALS PROCEDURE:

10-3-8-1: NORTHWEST AREA ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES FEE:
A. Definitions: For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings given:
GROSS ACRES: The total acres within a plat, subdivision, or parcel. Gross acres do not include outlots within a plat that are intended to
be replatted at a later date into developable lots.
NORTHWEST AREA: That certain geographic area within the City of Inver Grove Heights, defined, established, and referred to as the
Northwest Area Overlay District pursuant to chapter 13, article J of this title.
B. Purpose And Intent:
1. Minnesota Statutes section 462.353, subd. 4 allows municipalities to prescribe fees sufficient to defray the costs incurred in the review,
investigation, and administration of subdivision applications. The City has incurred costs while preparing studies and analyses in the
Northwest Area, an area of approximately three thousand one hundred forty (3,140) acres. These studies include:
a. "Natural Resource Inventory and Management Plan for the Northwest Area", prepared by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates,
dated January 2004.
b. "Northwest Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis", prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, dated February 2004.
c. "Northwest Expansion Area Alternative Urban Area-Wide Review (AUAR)", prepared by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates,
dated January 2006.
d. "2005 Basin Monitoring", prepared by Emmons & Olivier, dated April 2006. "Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Low Impact
Development - Overflow Contingencies and Cost Analysis", prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, dated July 2006.
e. "Northwest Area Surface Water Modeling Report", prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, dated August 2006.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 334/526
2. These studies and analyses provide direct benefit to subdividers in the Northwest Area. These studies and analyses were necessary
and advisable in order to review, investigate, and administer applications for subdivision within the Northwest Area. But for the City
having prepared these studies and analyses, the subdividers in the Northwest Area would, in all likelihood, have had to prepare the
studies themselves. The costs incurred by the City in performing the above studies was at least three hundred seventeen thousand
three hundred eighty two dollars ($317,382.00).
3. The purpose and intent of this section is to establish fees to reimburse the City for its costs in performing these studies and analyses.
C. Fee Established; Payment: A fee of eighty dollars ($80.00) per gross acre, to be known as the Northwest Area environmental studies fee,
is hereby established, imposed and required to be paid by all applicants for subdivision in the northwest area. The northwest area
environmental studies fee shall be paid by the applicant when an application is submitted to the city for approval of a final plat in the
northwest area. (Ord. 1171, 12-10-2007)
10-3-9: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
The violation of any provision of this title or the violation of the conditions or provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this title shall be a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, the violator shall be subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. Unless otherwise provided, each act
of violation and every day on which such violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate offense. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
ARTICLE A. CONDITIONAL USES
10-3A-1: PURPOSE; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
In order to give the district use regulations of this title the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive guide plan, in
certain districts conditional uses are permitted, subject to the granting of a use permit. Conditional uses include those uses generally not

use permit may be granted. Conditions may be applied to issuance of the permit, and a periodic review of the permit may be required. The
permit shall be issued for a particular use and not for a particular person or firm. The cancellation of a permit shall be subject to the same
public hearing, procedure and notice requirements as set forth in section 10-3-5 of this chapter for amendments. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-2: AMENDMENT PROCEDURES APPLY:
Except as otherwise provided in this article, the application, public hearing, notice and procedure requirements for conditional use permits
shall be the same as those for amendments set forth in 10-3-5 of this chapter. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

terms of chapter 15, article J of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-5: REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION; ACTION BY COUNCIL:
A. The planning commission may recommend to approve, approve with conditions or deny a request for a conditional use permit. In making a
recommendation, the planning commission shall consider the following provisions. If the planning commission does not make a
recommendation in a timely fashion, the council may act without the recommendation. The city council may grant a conditional use permit
as the use permit was applied for, or in modified form, and impose conditions and safeguards therein, if it determines the following:
1. The use is consistent with the goals, policies and plans of the city comprehensive plan, including future land uses, utilities, streets and
parks.
2. The use is consistent with this code, especially this title and the intent of the specific zoning district in which the use is located.
3. The use would not be materially injurious to existing or planned properties or improvements in the vicinity.
4. The use does not have an undue adverse impact on existing or planned city facilities and services, including streets, utilities, parks,
police and fire, and the reasonable ability of the city to provide such services in an orderly, timely manner.
5. The use is generally compatible with existing and future uses of surrounding properties, including:
a. Aesthetics/exterior appearance.
b. Noise.
c. Traffic.
d. Drainage.
e. Fencing, landscaping and buffering.
f. Other operational characteristics.
6. The property is appropriate for the use considering:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

8. The use does not have an undue adverse impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, surface water, ground water and air
quality.
B. Approval of the conditional use permit shall require a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the entire council. The council shall either approve or deny the
conditional use permit application within the time limit established by Minnesota statutes section 15.99. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
C. Within the I-2 district only, modifications to the previously approved site plan of an approved conditional use permit shall be allowed by
administrative review subject to the following procedural requirements:
1. Plan review will be in accordance with established procedures on file with the planning department including the coordinated review by
other city departments and divisions as determined by the zoning administrator.
2. Administrative approval including all applicable conditions and requirements shall be made in writing by the zoning administrator. The
applicant, in addition to all other applicable requirements, shall submit a written acknowledgment of that approval prior to the
commencement of any development and prior to the issuance of any permits.
3. Any unresolved dispute as to administrative interpretation of this code, this title, or policy requirements may be formally appealed
pursuant to this title.
4. Any variance proposal will automatically require the entire application to be processed in accordance with the planning commission
review and city council approval provisions of section 10-3-4 of this chapter.
5. Any new use not approved under the existing conditional use permit and is classified as a conditional use in the corresponding zoning
district, shall require the entire application to be processed in accordance with the requirements for conditional uses in this article.
6. The zoning administrator may waive or modify data submission application requirements if the zoning administrator determines
previously made submissions for the property substantially address the information needed to evaluate the requested modifications.
(Ord. 1322, 10-10-2016)
10-3A-6: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPECIAL STUDIES:
A. In making its findings for the issuance or denial of a conditional use permit, the city council may require the preparation of an environmental
assessment worksheet (EAW), environmental impact statement (EIS) or any special studies it deems necessary or advisable in order to
provide more factual or detailed information on which to base approval, denial or mitigating condition of a conditional use permit. Said
special studies may include, but not be limited to: traffic, utilities, engineering, economics, potential health hazard, groundwater, air quality,
wetlands or similar matters. With respect to studies for potential health hazard, a human health risk assessment in conformance with
chapter LIV of the city administrative code may be required.
B. The reasonable cost of the preparation of an EAW, EIS or other special study, as required by the city council, shall be borne by the
conditional use permit applicant. Where an EAW, EIS or other special study has been ordered by the council, no final action on the
conditional use permit request shall occur until completion of the study as required. Failure by the applicant to finance or provide for
special studies and corresponding information required by the city council may be sufficient reason to deny a request for a conditional use
permit. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-7: LAPSE OF PERMIT; EXTENSIONS:
A. A conditional use permit shall become void two (2) years after being granted by the city council unless it is used prior to the expiration of
said two (2) year period. An extension of the two (2) year period may be requested subject to the following procedure:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 337/526
1. At least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit to the city council a written
request for a time limit extension, stating the reasons for the extension request.
2. Upon receipt of the extension request, the city council may either:
a. Act upon the request; or
b. Refer the matter to the planning commission for further study.
3. If the extension request is referred to the planning commission, that body shall conduct an informal review to determine if changes have
occurred in the area which would warrant a new public hearing or denial of the time extension request. The planning commission shall
subsequently make a recommendation to the city council suggesting approval of the time extension, denial of the time extension, or
recommending that the property owner reapply for a new conditional use permit, thus initiating a new public hearing. In the event that
the planning commission recommends denial of the time extension, or submittal of a new application for a conditional use permit, the
reasons for such a determination shall be stated.
4. A maximum of one time limit extension may be requested for any previously approved conditional use permit. Said time limit extension
shall be valid for only one year from the day of the month that the original conditional use permit was approved.
B. Upon expiration of the time limit extension, the property owner may resubmit a new request for a conditional use permit, subject to all
procedures and fees in effect at the time of submittal. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-8: VIOLATIONS; TERMINATION OF PERMIT:
A violation of any condition set forth in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this title and also automatically terminate the conditional
use permit. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

10-9E-1: PURPOSE:
The LaFayette neighborhood is a unique area to the city, and is the subject of a component of the city comprehensive plan. The LaFayette
neighborhood comprehensive plan component encourages growth in the area by means of the planned unit development approach. As
multiple-family developments are proposed in the neighborhood and are found compatible by the city, the ordinance that is specific to the

10-9E-2: TRAFFIC ALLOCATION:
A principal reason for planning the development of the LaFayette neighborhood by means of a specific comprehensive plan component and a
separate ordinance unique to the neighborhood is that the traffic capacity of the main arterial streets in the neighborhood is limited.
Consequently, to better assure that the key intersections in the neighborhood function at an acceptable level, and to allow for an equitable
distribution of traffic to all properties in the neighborhood, regardless of whether they are the first or last to develop, traffic generation is
carefully planned and monitored. Each proposed development is analyzed against the needs and resources of the whole neighborhood, and
at the same time, the ordinance for the LaFayette neighborhood is amended by adding a new use/development. A peak P.M. rush hour traffic
amount will also be allocated for the new use/development. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

SPECIAL USE DISTRICTS
ARTICLE A. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
10-13A-1: PURPOSE:
This article is adopted for the purposes of:
A. Providing the means for greater creativity and flexibility in environmental design than is proposed under the strict application of this title
while at the same time preserving the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.
B. Recognizing the economic and cultural advantages that will accrue to the residents of a planned community.
C. Encouraging a more creative and efficient approach to the use of the land.
D. Encouraging the preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics and open space.
E. Encouraging a development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation facilities and community facilities, and objectives of
the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-2: INTERPRETATION:
The provisions of this article shall be interpreted in accordance with the following:
A. Planned unit developments may be excluded from certain requirements of this title when specifically approved as a part of the planned unit
development. Such exclusions shall only be granted for the purpose of creating better overall design and an improved living environment
and not solely for the economic advantage of the developer. All provisions of this title not specifically excluded in the preliminary and/or
final plan shall apply to the planned unit development.
B. In most cases, the granting of a planned unit development permit does not alter in any manner the underlying zoning district classification,
except that building permits shall not be issued which are not in conformity with the approved planned unit development. In those cases
where a specific planned unit development ordinance is adopted for a development (in contrast to those cases in which adoption of an
ordinance simply effects a rezoning of the development site to a planned unit development district), the granting of a planned unit
development permit to that development shall confer upon its planned unit development ordinance precedence over this title.
C. Whenever a dispute arises concerning the interpretation and/or application of any section of this title, the matter may be referred to the
board of adjustments and appeals for hearing pursuant to section 10-3-7 of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-3: RELATION OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SITE TO ADJACENT AREAS:
The design of a planned unit development shall take into account the relationship of the site to the surrounding areas. The perimeter of the
planned unit development shall be so designed to minimize undesirable impact of the development on adjacent properties and, conversely, to
minimize undesirable impact of adjacent land use and development characteristics on the planned unit development. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-4: MINIMUM AREA:
The minimum total area required for a planned unit development shall be ten (10) acres of contiguous land. Tracts of less than ten (10) acres
may qualify only if the applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be waived because a planned unit development is in
the public interest and that one or both of the following conditions exist:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 373/526
A. Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard
provisions of the normal district would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the
neighborhood or community.
B. The property is adjacent to or across the street from property which has been developed under the provisions of this article and will
contribute to the amenities of the neighborhood. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-5: SITE COVERAGE:
A. Residential Districts: In residential districts, the total ground area occupied by buildings in a planned unit development shall not exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the net land area, excluding public streets and permanent water areas.
B. Nonresidential Districts: In nonresidential districts, the total ground area occupied by buildings in a planned unit development shall not
exceed thirty percent (30%) of the net land area, excluding public streets and permanent water areas. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-6: RESIDENTIAL UNIT DENSITIES:
A planned unit development may provide for a variety of housing types in any one of the basic residential zoning districts. The total number of
dwelling units allowed in a development shall be determined by either:
A. The area standards of the underlying zoning district in which the proposed development is to be located; or
B. The density specified by the city council consistent with the intent of the city comprehensive plan. A plan may provide for a greater number
of dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations otherwise applicable to the site; however, the applicant has
the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable
enjoyment of neighboring property. The council, in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized dwelling units per
acre, shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public
facilities and services to be achieved by:
1. The location, amount and proposed use of common open space;
2. The location, design and type of dwelling units; and
3. The physical characteristics of the site. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-7: SETBACK AND SIDE YARD REQUIREMENTS:
Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, every lot in a planned unit development abutting the perimeter of the development shall
conform to the yard requirements for the underlying district. Side yards between buildings in a planned unit development shall be not less than
twenty feet (20') or the height of the building in nonresidential developments, whichever is greater, but such buildings may be constructed
without reference to the property lines of the individual lots on which they are built. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-8: OPEN SPACE:
A. A primary function of this article is to encourage development which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain
characteristics and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order to arrive at the maximum intensity or density
allowed. In evaluating each individual proposal, the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial
including, but not limited to, the following:
1. The amount and location of private common open space area shall be consistent with the stated purpose of this article and in no case
shall be less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total project area. The residential portion of the project area shall further conform to the
mandatory public park, playground and open space area dedication requirements of section 11-4-5 of this code.
2. All open space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or designed functions.
B. In the event certain land areas or structures are provided within the planned unit development for recreational use or as service facilities,
the owner of such land and buildings shall file a suitable agreement with the city that assures the continued operation and maintenance to
a predetermined reasonable standard. These common areas may be placed under the ownership of one of the following, depending which
is more appropriate:
1. Landlord control.
2. Homeowners' association, provided all of the following conditions are met:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 374/526
a. The homeowners' association must be established prior to any sale.
b. Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive buyer.
c. The open space restrictions must be permanent, not for a given period of years.
d. The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and the maintenance of residential and other facilities.
e. Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the
property in accordance with Minnesota statutes.
f. The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changing needs. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-9: PERMITTED USES:
Uses approved and permitted under a planned unit development shall only include permitted, conditional and accessory uses allowed in
residential districts in the city and those business, industry and institutional uses specifically approved as a part of the planned unit
development and in accordance with standards herein provided. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

A. Minimum Requirements: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements and
shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state
statutes.
B. Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail.
C. Measuring Distance: For the purpose of this article, all distances, unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-13B-6: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
A. Administration And Enforcement Official: The zoning administrator shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this
article.
B. Permit Requirements:
1. Permit Required: A permit is required for the construction of buildings or building additions (and including such related activities as
construction of fences, decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading and filling
activities not exempted by subsection 10-13B-9I of this article.
2. Application For Permit: Application for a permit shall be made to the city on the forms provided. The application shall include the
necessary information so that the city can determine the site's suitability for the intended use and that a conforming sewage treatment
system will be provided should any building permits or conditional use permits be issued.
3. Conditions: Any permit that is issued as described in this subsection shall stipulate that an identified nonconforming sewage treatment
system, as defined by section 10-13B-16 of this article, shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
C. Zoning Compliance: Zoning compliance by the city shall be required for each activity requiring a permit as specified in subsection B of this
section. This will specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this article. Any use, arrangement, or construction that varies
from what has been authorized by permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and shall be punishable as provided by subsection F of
this section. This subsection shall be satisfied by planning approval of permits as they are processed by the city.
D. Variances:
1. Variances may be granted only in accordance with Minnesota statutes chapter 462. A variance shall not circumvent the general
purposes and intent of this article. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in which
the subject property is located. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent
properties and the public interest. In considering a variance request, the city council will also consider whether the property owner has
reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the property is used seasonally or year round, whether the variance is being
requested solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics of development on adjacent properties.
2. The city shall hear and decide requests for variances, including variances for sewage treatment systems in shoreland districts, in
accordance with the rules that the city has adopted for consideration of variances in section 10-3-4 of this title. When a variance is
approved after the department of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the
approved variance required in subsection E of this section shall also include the summary of the public record/testimony and the findings
of fact and conclusions, which supported the issuance of the variance.
3. For existing developments, the application for variance shall clearly demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is
present for the intended use of the property. All variances granted shall require reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment
system.
E. Notice To Department Of Natural Resources:
1. Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, amendments, planned developments, or conditional uses under
shoreland management controls shall be sent to the DNR or the DNR's designated representative and postmarked at least ten (10) days
prior to the hearing. Notices of hearings to consider proposed preliminary plats shall include copies thereof.
2. A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats and final decisions granting variances, planned developments, or conditional
uses under shoreland management controls must be sent to the DNR or the DNR's designated representative and postmarked within
ten (10) days of final action.
F. Violations: Any violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions
and safeguards established in connection with building permits, shoreland alteration permits, grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law. Violations of this article can occur regardless of whether or not a
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 379/526
permit is required for a regulated activity pursuant to subsection B of this section. Each day that a violation of the provisions of this article
exists shall constitute a separate misdemeanor. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

B. Land Use Zoning Districts:
1. Purpose: The development of shorelands of public waters shall be controlled by means of land use zoning districts which are
designated to be compatible with the classes of public waters to which they apply. Land use zoning districts are established to provide
for:
a. The management of areas unsuitable for development due to wet soils, steep slopes, flooding, inadequate drainage, severe erosion
potential, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the residents
of the city.
b. The preservation of areas suitable for residential development from encroachment by commercial and industrial uses.
c. The centralization of service facilities for residential areas and enhancement of economic growth for those areas suitable for limited
commercial development.
d. The management of areas for commercial or industrial uses which, by their nature, require location in shoreland areas.
e. The preservation and enhancement of the quality of water based recreational use of public waters including provisions for public
accesses.

date hereof for the lake and river classifications are as set forth in this section.
2. Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area and lot width requirements. These minimum
requirements shall be met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building line. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-9: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The following general provisions shall be required in the shoreland overlay districts:
A. Lots For Controlled Access: Lots used for controlled access to public waters or as recreation areas by owners of nonriparian lots within
subdivisions shall meet or exceed the following standards:
1. Lots shall meet the minimum width and area requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access
lots;
2. If docking, mooring, or over water storage of more than six (6) watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the
lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by twenty five percent (25%) in lot frontage for each watercraft beyond six (6);
3. Lots must be jointly or commonly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the
subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot in a manner acceptable to the city and the DNR; and
4. Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments shall be developed that specifically state which lot owners have authority to use
the access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or
docking. They shall also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public
water or the enjoyment of normal property rights of adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant conflict activities include
swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants shall limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of
watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and shall require centralization of all common facilities and
activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. They shall also require all parking
areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public
water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
B. Placement Of Structure On Lots: When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all
setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks required for a new
proposed building or an addition to an existing building may be altered without a variance to conform to the average setbacks on the
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 383/526
adjoining lots from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or bluff impact
zone.
C. Floodplain Regulations:
1. Structures shall be located in accordance with the city floodplain regulations, article D of this chapter, that are applicable to the site.
2. Water oriented accessory structures, where allowed, may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined by the
procedures in this article if the structure is constructed of flood resistant materials to the flood elevation, electrical and mechanical
equipment is placed above the flood elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action,
wind driven waves and debris.
D. Water Oriented Accessory Structures: On general development and recreation development lakes and urban and transitional rivers, each
residence may have one water oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in section 10-13B-8 of this article if
this water oriented accessory structure complies with the following provisions:
1. The accessory use shall not be a boathouse, fish house, or pump house which are prohibited uses in all shoreland zoning districts; and
2. The structure or facility shall not exceed ten feet (10') in height, exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than one
hundred fifty (150) square feet. Detached decks shall not exceed eight feet (8') above grade at any point; and
3. The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level shall be at least ten feet (10') except for a boat lift; and
4. The structure or facility shall be treated to reduce visibility, as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands, by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions; and
5. The structure or facility shall not be designed or used for human habitation and shall not contain water supply or sewage treatment
facilities.
E. Stairways, Lifts, Landings And Docks: Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access
up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts shall meet the following design requirements:
1. Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet (4') in width. Wider stairways may be used for public open space recreational properties;
2. Landings for stairways, landings at the bottom of stairways and lifts on residential lots shall not exceed thirty two (32) square feet in
area. Landings larger than thirty two (32) square feet may be used for public open space recreational properties;
3. Canopies or roofs shall not be permitted on stairways, lifts or landings;
4. Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they
are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
5. Stairways, lifts, and landings shall be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public
water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical;
6. Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of subsections E1 to E5 of this section are complied with in addition to
the requirements of Minnesota regulations chapter 1340; and
7. Docks that exceed five feet (5') in width require a shoreland building permit.
F. Significant Historic Sites: No structure shall be placed on a significant historic site in a manner that affects the historical value of the site
unless adequate information about the site, as determined by the Minnesota Historical Society, has been reviewed and documented in a
public repository.
G. Steep Slopes: The city shall evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for
construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined
necessary, conditions shall be attached to issued permits to prevent soil erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of
structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
H. Height Of Structures: All structures in all shoreland districts shall not exceed thirty five feet (35') in height, except that a conditional use
permit may be granted for additional height up to four (4) stories maximum. Said conditional use permit for additional height shall be
subject to notice and comment by the DNR before issuance by the city.
I. Shoreland Alterations: Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent soil erosion into public waters, fix nutrients,
preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
J. Vegetation Alterations:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 384/526
1. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and
parking areas regulated by section 10-13B-10 of this article are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow.
2. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest management uses as regulated in section 10-13B-14 of this
article, is allowed subject to the following standards:
a. Clear cutting and intensive vegetation clearing within the shore impact zones and on steep slopes are not permitted. Intensive
vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a conditional use if a soil erosion
control and sedimentation plan is developed and approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is located.
b. In shore impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed
to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic
areas, access paths, beach and watercraft areas, and permitted water oriented accessory structures of facilities, provided that:
(1) The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
(2) Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved; and
(3) In the shore impact zone, live trees larger than six inches (6") in diameter shall not be cut, except to provide for water oriented
accessory structures or to provide a water viewing corridor not to exceed twenty percent (20%) of the shoreline width of the lot.
3. The provisions of this subsection are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety
hazards. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-10: TOPOGRAPHIC ALTERATIONS/GRADING AND FILLING:
A. Construction Of Structures, Sewage Systems, Driveways: Grading, filling and excavations necessary for the construction of structures,
sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly issued building permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a
separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this section shall be incorporated into the issuance of
permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways.
B. Roads; Utilities; Parking: Public roads, public utilities and parking areas are regulated by this section.
C. Permit Required: Not withstanding subsections A and B of this section, a grading and filling permit shall be required for:
1. The movement of more than ten (10) cubic yards of material on steep slopes and within shore impact zones.
2. The movement of more than fifty (50) cubic yards of material outside of steep slopes and shore impact zones.
D. Considerations And Conditions: The following considerations and conditions shall be adhered to during the issuance of construction
permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals:
1. Any filling that occurs in any type 3, 4, or 5 wetland over two and one-half (2.5) acres in area shall require a permit from the DNR;
2. Alterations shall be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures that only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the
shortest time possible;
3. Mulches or similar materials shall be used, where necessary, for temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover shall
be established as soon as weather conditions allow;
4. Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach any surface water feature shall be used;
5. Altered areas shall be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States soil conservation service;
6. Fill or excavated material shall not be placed in a manner that creates an unstable slope;
7. Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes shall be reviewed by the city engineer for continued slope stability and shall not
create finished slopes of thirty percent (30%) or greater;
8. Fill or excavated material shall not be placed in bluff impact zones;
9. Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters shall first be authorized by the DNR under Minnesota statutes
section 103G.245;
10. Alterations of topography shall be allowed only if they are accessory to construction of public utilities, permitted or conditional uses and
do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties;
11. Placement of natural rock riprap and placement of a filter blanket are permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet (3')
horizontal to one foot (1') vertical (may be increased by DNR permit), the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet (10') of the
ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet (3'); and
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 385/526
12. Excavations and fills shall also be subject to all other provisions of this code related thereto.
E. Connection To Public Waters: Excavations, where the intended purpose is a new connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals,
lagoons, and harbors, require a conditional use permit. Permission for excavations may be given only after the DNR has approved the
proposed connection to public waters. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-11: WETLAND PROTECTION:
A. Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland shall be evaluated by the city to determine how extensively the proposed activity
would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland:
1. Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
2. Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
3. Fish and wildlife habitat;
4. Recreational use;
5. Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
6. Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or other.
B. An evaluation shall also be made to determine whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by
other local, state, or federal agencies such as a watershed district, the Minnesota department of natural resources, or the United States
army corps of engineers. The person(s) proposing the wetland alteration shall be responsible for this evaluation and compliance with these
agency regulations and requirements. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
C. Development, grading and filling shall comply with the provisions of the Minnesota wetland conservation act of 1991, Minnesota statutes
section 103G.221 et seq. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004; amd. 2008 Code)
10-13B-12: ROADS, DRIVEWAYS AND PARKING AREAS:
A. Public and private roads and parking areas shall be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum
screening from view from public waters. Documentation shall be provided to the city engineer that all roads and parking areas are
designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation district, or other applicable technical materials.
B. Roads, driveways and parking areas shall meet structure setbacks and shall not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other
reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they shall be placed within these areas, and shall be
designed to minimize adverse impacts.
C. Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones,
provided the vegetation screening and erosion control conditions of this section are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling
provisions of section 10-13B-10 of this article shall be met. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-13: STORM WATER MANAGEMENT:
The following general and specific storm water management standards shall apply:
A. General Standards:
1. When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain
storm water runoff before discharge to public waters.
2. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities and erosion
potential that will reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible, and facilities
or methods must be used to retain sediment on the site.
3. When development density, topographic features and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices,
dikes, waterways, and ponds shall be required. Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration
rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities. Settling basins to intercept urban runoff shall be sized to a minimum of a
10-year storm design.

procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in planned development
areas:
1. Shoreland Tier Dimensions: The project parcel shall be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line
that identifies the ordinary high water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
SHORELAND TIER DIMENSIONS
Type Of Lake Sewered (Feet)

General development lakes - second and additional tiers 200
Recreational development lakes 267
Natural environment lakes 320
Urban river 200
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 389/526
2. Suitable Area Calculation: The suitable area within each tier is calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land
below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the
residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
F. Residential And Commercial PD Density Evaluation: The procedures for determining the base density of a PD and density increase
multipliers are as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the water body, but shall not be
transferred to any other tier closer.
1. For residential PD base density evaluation, the suitable area within each tier is divided by the minimum single residential lot size
standard for lakes to determine the maximum permitted density. Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for residential
planned developments are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in subsection G of
this section.
2. For commercial PD base density evaluation, determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier,
including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes shall not include decks, patios, stoops,
steps, garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
3. Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table:
COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
FLOOR AREA RATIOS
PUBLIC WATER CLASSES
Average Unit Floor Area (Square
Feet)
Urban River And General
Development Lakes
Recreational Development
Lakes
Natural Environmental
Lakes
400 .056 .028 .014
500 .065 .032 .016
600 .072 .038 .019
700 .082 .042 .021
800 .091 .046 .023
900 .099 .050 .025
1,000 .108 .054 .027
1,100 .116 .058 .029
1,200 .125 .064 .032
1,300 .133 .068 .034
1,400 .142 .072 .036
1,500 and above .150 .075 .038
4. Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units
or sites.
5. Divide the total floor area by tier, computed in subsection F4 of this section, by the average inside living area size determined in
subsection F1 of this section. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier.
6. Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned development are then compared with the tier,
density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in subsection G of this section.
7. a. Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in
section 10-13B-8 of this article are met or exceeded and the design criteria in subsection G of this section are satisfied. The allowable
density increases in subsection F7b of this section will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are
increased to at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the minimum setback, or an impact on the water body is reduced an equivalent
amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the city, and the setback is at least twenty five
percent (25%) greater than the minimum setback.
b. Dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for residential or commercial planned unit developments are allowed as follows:
Density Evaluation Tiers
Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier (Percent)
First 50
Second 100
Third 200
Fourth 200
Fifth 200

ARTICLE D. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
10-13D-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY:
The legislature of the state has, in Minnesota statutes chapter 103F and section 462.357, delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council has adopted the provisions of this article. (Ord. 1243,
10-24-2011)
10-13D-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of
the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-3: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 10-
13D-2 of this article by provisions contained in this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-4: METHOD OF ANALYZING FLOOD HAZARDS:
This article is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards, which is consistent with the standards established by the
Minnesota department of natural resources. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-5: NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM COMPLIANCE:
This article is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance program codified as 44 code of federal
regulations parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the national flood insurance program. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-

10-13D-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Application And Interpretation:
1. Application Of Provisions: This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city as shown on the official zoning map as
being within the boundaries of the floodway or flood fringe district.
2. Minimum Requirements: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements,
and this article shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers
granted by state statutes.
3. District Boundaries: The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the zoning administrator, the board of adjustments and appeals shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be
based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the community
adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first national flood insurance program map showing the area within the 100-
year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the board and to submit technical evidence.
4. Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants,
or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail.
B. Compliance Required: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no new or existing structure shall be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations which
apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this article. Within the floodway and flood fringe districts, all uses not listed as permitted uses or
conditional uses within sections 10-13D-7-1 and 10-13D-7-2 of this article, respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is

existing nonconforming building, then the building addition and the existing nonconforming building must meet the requirements of
sections 10-13D-7-1 and 10-13D-7-2 of this article for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood
fringe district, respectively.
E. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: This article does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts, or land uses permitted within such
districts, will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
F. Annexations: The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into subsection C of this section may include floodplain areas that
lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the city of Inver Grove Heights at the time of adoption of this article. If any of these floodplain
land areas are annexed into the city of Inver Grove Heights after the adoption date hereof, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be
subject to the provisions of this article immediately upon the date of annexation into the city of Inver Grove Heights. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-
2011)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 404/526
Storage yards for equipment, machinery or materials.
Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls, constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual
structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-
year frequency flood event.
Structures accessory to the uses listed in subsection A of this section and in the above entries in this subsection B1.
Other uses listed as conditional uses by the underlying zoning district but not allowed by this subsection B1 shall be prohibited in the
floodway district.
2. Standards:
a. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment,
or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause
an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
b. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in subsection 10-13D-13B4 of this article.
c. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district.
d. (1) Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
(2) Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long term site development plan is
submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
(3) As an alternative, and consistent with subsection B2d(2) of this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may
allow temporary, on site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or
regional flood but only after the city council has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the
floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the
office of the county recorder.
(4) Title 9, chapter 4 of this code shall apply to all fill and excavation activities within the floodway district.
e. (1) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
(2) Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to
the flow of floodwaters.
(A) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
(B) As far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
(3) Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4
floodproofing classification in the state building code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not
exceed five hundred (500) square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional
standards:
(A) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be
designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
(B) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or
properly floodproofed; and
(C) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two (2) "automatic" openings in the outside
walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. There must be openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than
one foot (1') above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding
will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
f. (1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal
or plant life is prohibited.
(2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council as part of the conditional use permit.
g. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of a protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of Minnesota statutes chapters 103A, 103B, 103C, 103D, 103E, 103F and 103G. Community wide structural
works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway.

10-13D-7-2: FF FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT:
A. Permitted Uses:
1. Enumerated: Permitted uses shall be those uses or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning district(s). All permitted
uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe district permitted uses and the standards for all flood fringe uses listed below.
2. Standards:
a. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above
the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot (1') below the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill (maximum 4:1 slope) shall extend such elevation at least fifteen feet (15') beyond the
outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
b. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred
(500) square feet at its largest projection may be internally floodproofed in accordance with subsection 10-13D-7-1B2e(3) of this
article.
c. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel
shall be allowable only as a conditional use unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection
A2a of this section. Title 9, chapter 4 of this code shall also apply to all fill and excavation activities regardless of the quantitative
amount of material.
d. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
e. The provisions of subsection C of this section shall apply.
B. Conditional Uses:
1. Enumerated: Conditional uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as conditional uses in the underlying zoning district(s) or
other applicable zoning overlay district(s).
a. Any structure not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections A2a and A2b of this section and/or any use of land
that does not comply with the standards in subsections A2c and A2d of this section shall only be allowed as a conditional use. An
application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections B2
of this section and 10-13D-13B4 of this article.
2. Standards:
a. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above grade, enclosed
areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above grade and not a
structure's basement or lowest floor, if: 1) the enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to
internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. These alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(1) Design And Certification: A structure's design and as built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or
be designed to prevent floodwater from accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
(2) Specific Standards For Above Grade, Enclosed Areas: Above grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under
garages must be designed to internally flood, and design plans must stipulate:
(A) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a
minimum of two (2) openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot (1') above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area
would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters without any form of human intervention; and
(B) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the
state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
b. Basements, as defined by section 10-2-2 of this title, shall be subject to the following:
(1) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(2) Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation, provided the basement is structurally
dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection 10-13D-6B3 of this article.
c. All areas on nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classification in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing
must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code, and this shall require making the structure
watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and structural components having the capability of
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 406/526
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification
shall not be permitted.
d. When at any one time more than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such
activities as on site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, land fills, road, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood
control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the city is enforcing a state approved shoreland
management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified
by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city council. The plan may incorporate alternative
procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
e. (1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal
or plant life is prohibited.
(2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council as part of the conditional use permit.
f. The provisions of subsection C of this section shall also apply.
C. Standards For All Flood Fringe Uses:
1. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
2. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots, may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of
a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that
when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the
regional flood.
3. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood
durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
subsection C2 of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose
business requires that it be located in floodplain areas.
4. Fill shall be properly compacted, and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area
designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA requirements incorporate specific fill
compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
5. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map.
6. Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in section 10-13D-12 of this article.
7. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-8: SUBDIVISIONS:
A. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities.
B. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
C. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this article and have road access both to
the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
D. For all subdivisions, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all
access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
E. All subdivisions shall be in conformance with title 11 of this code and other applicable zoning and zoning overlay districts. (Ord. 1243, 10-
24-2011)

The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for
certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and
side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of
site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be required. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-10: PUBLIC UTILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES:

be floodproofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
B. Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads and bridges to be located within the floodplain shall comply with sections 10-13D-7-1
and 10-13D-7-2 of this article. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these
transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning
of the area. Minor or auxiliary railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services
would not endanger the public health or safety. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-11: ON SITE SEWAGE TREATMENT AND WATER SYSTEMS:
Where public utilities are not provided: a) on site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems; and b) new or replacement on site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into the floodwaters, and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the state's current statewide standards for
on site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)

ARTICLE E. IRM INTEGRATED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OVERLAY
DISTRICT
10-13E-1: FINDINGS:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 411/526
Mixed municipal solid waste landfills have the potential to cause negative environmental impacts relating to storm water quality, ground water
quality, air emissions, aesthetics, general community and neighborhood image, and public nuisances. As a result, the city has found that
many land uses are not compatible with and will not locate adjacent to or near a mixed municipal solid waste landfill. This tends to restrict
development opportunities on surrounding properties, thus hindering the expansion of the city's commercial/industrial tax base and
employment opportunities. It also causes a public concern that landfill expansion may be proposed for such undeveloped areas.
A. The city specifically finds that certain solid waste processing uses are compatible with and may benefit from a location in proximity to a
mixed municipal solid waste landfill and other solid waste uses. This is evident from the uses that have already been established near the
Pine Bend mixed municipal solid waste landfill and the continued interest on the part of other such uses in the same area. The
concentration of mixed municipal solid waste landfills and solid waste facilities provides for: 1) effective and efficient public facilities and
services; 2) the potential for shared private facilities and services; and 3) strong operational interrelationships. Concentrating solid waste
uses reduces the area of the city potentially subject to the negative environmental impacts identified above from such facilities and
enhances the city's ability to protect the natural environment through monitoring, regulation, and inspection of these uses. Furthermore, it
is necessary to further restrict the area in which solid waste uses are allowed and to continue to place restrictions and conditions on these
uses to protect the environment and to promote sound land use planning.
B. The city also finds that the integrated resource management overlay district boundaries encompass an area which is unique to the city.
Since no other area in the city exhibits these special characteristics, the district boundaries will only be imposed within the defined
boundaries and shall not be expanded. The unique characteristics of this stated area include the following:
1. A concentration of existing solid waste facilities, including a mixed municipal solid waste landfill, and other compatible heavy industries,
such as the Koch Refining Co. complex.
2. An area which is generally separated and buffered from surrounding low density residential areas by large tracts of undeveloped or
agricultural lands.
3. An excellent transportation network, including railroads, a regional highway, and a local collector street, that provides direct access to
the regional highway. This roadway system is undergoing improvements, such as the recent intersection signals, frontage road, and
intersection geometric being installed at 117th Street. Further development of the transportation system is anticipated, including
additional frontage roads and an interchange.
4. Intensive environmental analysis and monitoring, including air quality and ground water monitoring, that have occurred in recent years to
address environmental concerns.
5. A comprehensive plan land use designation of general industrial and light industrial. This is further reflected in the I-1 and I-2 zoning of
the area.
6. Affordable land costs, due in part to the absence of sanitary sewer, which makes the area suitable for those industries that require large
parcels but do not need city sewer services.
7. Level terrain with little vegetation that makes the area conducive to large industrial facilities. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13E-2: PURPOSE:
The integrated resource management (IRM) overlay zoning district is created for the following purposes:
A. Prevent the expansion of mixed municipal solid waste landfills by encouraging industrial development on adjacent properties.
B. Encourage solid waste processing facilities, which can integrate their operations with mixed municipal solid waste landfills to locate in
proximity to such landfills.
C. Promote orderly development of other properties in the community by creating a buffer of compatible industrial development around mixed
municipal solid waste landfills.
D. Reduce the areas of the city subject to the potential adverse environmental impacts of solid waste processing facilities by encouraging
them to locate in close proximity to mixed municipal solid waste landfills and each other.
E. Delineate an area for select solid waste uses that exhibit minimal environmental impacts and are generally environmentally friendly.
F. Provide an opportunity for solid waste uses that are consistent with the state's waste management hierarchy of encouraging reduction,
reuse, recycling, composting, and discouraging incineration and landfilling.
G. Enhance regulation and inspection of solid waste processing facilities by encouraging them to locate in proximity to one another.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 412/526
H. Enhance the tax base by encouraging development around mixed municipal solid waste landfills consistent with sound principles of
municipal planning.
I. Provide additional employment opportunities for city residents by encouraging industrial development.
J. Establish standards and restrictions for solid waste uses to protect the environment and to promote sound land use planning. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)

10-13E-8: LEGAL NONCONFORMING PROHIBITED USES:
A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this article, if any of the prohibited uses listed in section 10-13E-7 of this article were
lawfully existing at the time the use became prohibited, either because of adoption of this article, or any amendments hereto, then such
use may continue in the size and manner of operation lawfully existing or lawfully permitted to exist upon the date such use became
prohibited, but such uses shall not expand or enlarge or add different types of waste.
B. If the owner or operator of an existing prohibited use applies for a nonconforming use certificate, the application shall include the following
information in addition to the information normally required under chapter 16 of this title:
1. The types of prohibited use which existed on the effective date hereof, which made the use prohibited.
2. The lot or lots owned or occupied by the use on the effective date hereof, which made the use prohibited, with evidence of ownership or
occupancy.
3. If the prohibited use is a landfill, the airspace authorized by the metropolitan council or MOEA on the effective date hereof, which made
the use prohibited, with evidence of the metropolitan council or MOEA authorization.
4. If the prohibited use is a landfill, the remaining airspace capacity last reported to the MPCA.
5. The waste types received by the facility on or prior to the effective date hereof, which made the use prohibited, with evidence of receipt.
C. 1. A number of factors make the prohibited uses unique from a land use regulation standpoint including: a) the dynamic, evolutionary
nature of solid waste industry regulation; b) the overlapping regulations of various federal, state, and local agencies which apply to a
prohibited use; c) the differing wastes disposed or processed now and in the past by prohibited uses; d) the fluctuations in prohibited use
disposal and processing rates; e) the number, type, and intensity of accessory uses directly related to the prohibited uses; f) the
challenges posed to the city in monitoring and regulating a lawfully existing prohibited use; and g) the many regulatory and financial
uncertainties which face the owner or operator of a lawfully existing prohibited use. Therefore, the city council, sitting as the board of
adjustments and appeals, in approving a nonconforming use certificate, may include in the certificate, by majority vote, provisions which
vary from the requirements of sections 10-16-1 and 10-16-2 and subsection 10-16-4C of this title relating to nonconforming uses and
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 419/526
structures and this section relating to the continuation of lawfully existing prohibited uses. In exercising this authority, the city council shall
not: a) add a principal use which did not legally exist on the property prior to the property becoming nonconforming; b) enlarge the
geographic boundaries of a nonconforming use beyond the boundaries on the date the property became nonconforming; c) add to the
materials allowed to be processed or disposed on the property a major waste category (e.g., industrial waste, hazardous waste) which was
not processed or disposed on the property prior to the property becoming nonconforming; or d) in the case of landfills, add airspace
capacity beyond the permitted capacity which existed prior to the time the landfill became nonconforming.
2. Provided, however, with respect to demolition debris landfills only, the city council, in approving a nonconforming use certificate, may
authorize the enlargement of the geographic boundaries where demolition debris landfilling will occur and may authorize the
enlargement of the air space capacity as long as the following conditions are met:
a. Such expansions can only occur with respect to demolition debris landfills;
b. The demolition debris landfill has obtained a nonconforming use certificate;
c. The demolition debris landfill is in compliance with the nonconforming use certificate;
d. The expansions shall only be granted one time; there shall be no serial expansions;
e. The total airspace capacity of the entire demolition debris landfill after the increase shall not exceed 3,928,280 cubic yards, not
including cover material;
f. The total geographic boundaries of the entire demolition debris landfill after the increase where demolition debris landfill has and will
occur cannot exceed 29.4 acres;
g. The increased geographic area must be in the same fee ownership as the rest of the demolition debris landfill;
h. The increased geographic area must be contiguous to the rest of the demolition debris landfill;
i. The operator and the owner of the demolition debris landfill, as a condition of approval relating to the expansions, must, in writing,
agree to close the entire demolition debris landfill, including the expanded areas, no later than fifteen (15) years after the authorization
for expansion is granted, unless the council subsequently agrees to a longer duration;
j. The closure date for the entire landfill, including the expanded areas, must be earlier than the date that the unexpanded landfill could
have closed under the nonconforming use rights of the unexpanded landfill; and
k. The council determines that the final grades, storm water facilities and erosion control and mitigation measures for the expanded
landfill are more conducive to end use development and provide greater protections than the grades, storm water facilities, and
erosion control and mitigation measures would have been with respect to the unexpanded landfill. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13E-9: REVIEW CRITERIA:
For all conditional uses listed in this article, the following review criteria shall be used to determine the acceptability of a proposed use. In
addition, the review criteria of chapter 3, article A of this title and this section shall also be used to determine acceptability of a proposed use.
The city council may impose conditions and safeguards on a conditional use permit to ensure the purpose and intent of this article are met.
The review criteria of this article are as follows:
A. All sites shall be landscaped in accordance with the city policy for establishing minimum landscape standards and criteria for urban
development.
B. All sites shall be kept free of litter and debris and maintained in a neat and orderly manner. Fencing may be required to prevent the spread

ARTICLE F. NOISE ABATEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT
10-13F-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY:
This article is adopted pursuant to Minnesota statutes section 473.192, metropolitan area aircraft noise attenuation act. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-
2004)
10-13F-2: FINDINGS:
The city finds that development within certain areas of the city is impacted by aircraft noise; that said noise is beyond the regulatory authority
of the city to control; that certain uses of land are inappropriate in areas of high aircraft noise; that some structures do not adequately
attenuate aircraft noise resulting in negative impacts on the health, safety and welfare of the residents or inhabitants of the structures that,
through proper construction methods, the means exist to attenuate aircraft noise to interior levels which alleviate such negative impacts; and
that the requirements of this article are necessary to promote and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. (Ord.
1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to require that new or redeveloped buildings within the city be constructed with materials and in such a manner
that aircraft noise is attenuated by the structure to an interior level which has no adverse impact on the health, safety and general welfare of
the residents, all in accordance with the metropolitan council's guidelines for land use compatibility with aircraft noise. These guidelines are
part of the transportation policy plan of the metropolitan development guide. (Ord. 1121, 11-28-2005)
10-13F-4: SCOPE AND EFFECT:
The aircraft noise zones established by this article shall overlay the zoning districts so that any parcel of land lying in an overlay zone shall
also lie in one or more of the established zoning districts. Territory within a given overlay zone shall be subject to the requirements established
by the other applicable ordinances and regulations of the city. Within each adopted overlay zone, all uses shall be permitted in accordance
with the regulations for the underlying zoning districts; provided, however, that the appropriate building permit is first obtained; and provided
further, that no use designated as inconsistent on the noise compatibility table, and incorporated herein, shall be permitted. This article applies
to all construction requiring a building permit after the effective date hereof except decks, patios, swimming pools, breezeways and similar
outdoor uses and remodeling or rehabilitation of an existing residential building, nor to the construction of an appurtenance to an existing
residential building. In the case of conflict between this article and any other applicable codes or ordinances, the more restrictive requirement
shall be met. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-5: PREREQUISITES TO ISSUANCE OF BUILDING OR OCCUPANCY PERMIT:
Any application for a city building or occupancy permit pertaining to land located in an aircraft noise zone must demonstrate compliance with
the provisions of this article prior to the issuance of such permit. Moreover, any application for a building or occupancy permit pertaining to
land located in the aircraft buffer zone is encouraged to incorporate those provisions of this article which apply to noise zone 4 into building
plans. (Ord. 1121, 11-28-2005)
10-13F-6: AIRCRAFT NOISE ZONES:
A. Established: The following aircraft noise zones are hereby established as part of this title. These zones apply to the following airports:
Minneapolis-St. Paul International and South St. Paul municipal airports.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 421/526
Aircraft buffer zone DNL < 60
B. Boundaries: The boundaries of the aircraft noise zones are as delineated on the overlay district map of the city zoning map. (Ord. 1121, 11-
28-2005)
10-13F-7: NOISE COMPATIBILITY TABLES:
The noise compatibility table is adapted from the metropolitan council's guidelines for land use compatibility with aircraft noise. The noise
reduction level numbers, expressed in dBA, specify for each type of land use the amount of interior sound level reduction necessary for the
use to be compatible in the applicable aircraft noise zone. All construction or reconstruction requiring a building permit and located within an
aircraft noise zone (except remodeling or rehabilitation of an existing residential building) shall be constructed in such a way that the
applicable noise level reduction requirements contained in the noise compatibility table is met or exceeded. Where a particular structure
contains different land uses, the more stringent requirements of the applicable table shall apply, except where it is architecturally possible to
achieve the appropriate noise reduction level for each different use, and the uses are acoustically separated by a wall or partition with a
minimum STC of 25.

the permanent zoning district in which said operator is located.
F. Setbacks:
1. Residential Dwellings: Production, processing, excavation, sedimentation ponds and stockpiling shall not be conducted closer than
three hundred feet (300') to the boundary of any residential or multiple dwelling. Nor shall such operations be conducted closer than fifty
feet (50') to the boundary of an adjoining property line, except that excavation may be conducted within such limits in order to reduce the
elevation thereof in conforming to the adjoining property. Setbacks may be varied, provided they are approved by the council and shown
on the development plan.
2. Setback Along Streets: Sand and gravel operations shall not be conducted closer than seventy five feet (75') to the right of way line of
any existing or proposed platted street, road or highway, except that excavation may be conducted within such limits in order to reduce
the elevation thereof in conforming to a street grade established by the engineer.
3. Use For Access Roads: The setback area required may be, in part, used for access roads as approved by the council.
4. Landscaping Of Setback Areas: The minimum required setback area must be landscaped and planted in accordance with a professional
landscape plan. The landscape plan, through use of berms, foliage, or fencing, shall provide a solid visual screen. This site plan must be
approved and filed with the city. Such areas where landscaping is required shall be owned or controlled by an easement by the sand
and gravel operator during his period of operation.

conditions at least to the extent the unpaved public roadway is dust controlled.
I. Topsoil And Landscaping:
1. Graded and backfilled areas (or banks in the case of excavations made to a water producing depth) shall be covered with topsoil to a
minimum depth of six inches (6"), except that no greater depth of topsoil or percentage of organic material shall be required than that
originally existing on the property prior to commencement of operations.
2. Upon replacement of the topsoil, trees, shrubs, legumes, grasses or other ground cover shall be planted upon such area in order to
avoid erosion as far as practicable. Such restoration shall be on a continuing basis as excavation is completed, and no area shall be left
unattended for more than one year after excavation is completed.
J. Lighting: A lighting plan, including security lighting, shall be submitted and approved by the city. Lighting shall be shielded so that no direct

K. Travel Routes: When requested by the city, the operator shall submit a report on the proposed travel routes and truck count to and from the
site.
L. Termination Or Abandonment Of Operation:
1. Within a period of three (3) months after termination or abandonment of a sand and gravel operation, all buildings, structures and plants
incidental to such operation shall be dismantled and removed by and at the expense of the sand and gravel producer last operating
such buildings, structures or plants, or the owner of such property. If this is not done within the specified time, the city may contract to
complete the above work and charge these costs to producers last operating on the property or the owner of the property. Permanent
structures, which conform to the permanent zoning district requirements in which they are located, are not required to be removed.
2. Upon the completion or abandonment of a sand and gravel operation, the producer last operating the area or the owner of the property
will be responsible for grading to the proposed grades the area of operation. The proposed grades will provide for sufficient drainage so
that both natural and storm water leave the property at the original or natural drainage points except where otherwise designated by the
engineer. If this is not done within five (5) months, the city may contract to complete the above work and charge these costs to the
producer last operating on the property or the owner of the property. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13G-6: ADMINISTRATION OF PROVISIONS:
A. Excavation Permit: No person shall commence sand and gravel operations within the city without first obtaining an excavation permit and
renewing same on an annual basis.
B. Change In Underlying District: The sand and gravel district shall be overlying and in addition to another permanent zoning district as
designated on the zoning map, and the sand and gravel district shall only exist for the length of time specified by the council when the
district is established. The permanent zoning district may be changed during the term of the overlying temporary sand and gravel district
zoning.
C. Term Of Allied Operations: Operations allied to the extraction or mining of sand and gravel deposits such as asphalt plants, block plants, or
ready mix plants shall be phased out consistent with the depletion of said deposits and not be considered nonconforming uses after said
mining is completed. Temporary sand and gravel district zoning is not intended for those operations where sixty percent (60%) or more of
the deposits used on an annual basis in said allied operations must be hauled to the site. Said allied operations shall otherwise only be
conducted in the appropriate permanent zoning district.
D. Variances: The council may grant variances to any provision of this article where the intent and purpose is being met and where
compliance would cause an undue hardship. In the granting of said variance, the council may impose special conditions.
E. Short Term Operations: The council may waive any part of this article, or its entirety, and only require an excavation permit for sand and
gravel mining operations to be conducted over a very short period of time. This shall include, but not be limited to, mining deposits for the
sole purpose of construction of a public highway.
F. Removal Of Zoning: The city shall initiate action to remove the temporary sand and gravel district (SG) zoning from any property where the
sand and gravel operation is completed before the term of the temporary zoning. Said action shall also be initiated where a sand and
gravel operation has been abandoned or where an excavation permit has been revoked or not renewed by the city because of failure to
comply with city ordinances. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
ARTICLE H. SOUTH ST. PAUL AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT
10-13H-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY; PURPOSE:
The South St. Paul joint airport zoning board, created and established by joint action of the councils of the cities of Inver Grove Heights,
Newport, St. Paul Park, and South St. Paul, pursuant to the provisions and authority of Minnesota statutes section 360.063, hereby finds and
declares that:
A. An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the South St. Paul municipal airport and property or occupants of land in its
vicinity, and also, if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of
aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the South St. Paul municipal airport and the public investment therein.
B. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the South St. Paul municipal
airport.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 427/526
C. For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most
appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards.
D. The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
E. The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and
lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds. (Ord. 1098, 11-
8-2004)
10-13H-2: AIRSPACE OBSTRUCTION ZONING:
A. Airspace Zones: In order to carry out the purpose of this article, as set forth in section 10-13H-1 of this article, the following airspace zones
are hereby established: primary zone, horizontal zone, conical zone, approach zone, precision instrument approach zone, and transitional
zone, the locations and dimensions of which are as follows:
1. Primary Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary primary surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending two
hundred feet (200') beyond each end of runway 16-34. The elevation of any point of the primary surface is the same as the elevation of
the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is five hundred feet (500') for runway 16-34.
2. Horizontal Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary horizontal surface one hundred fifty feet (150') above the
established airport elevation, or a height of nine hundred seventy feet (970') above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is constructed
by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs
by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is six thousand feet (6,000') for runway 16-34.
3. Conical Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of
the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000') as measured radially
outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.
4. Approach Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary approach surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline
at each end of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of
the primary surface. The approach surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of forty to one (40:1) for runway 16-34. The approach
surface expands uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred feet (3,500') for runway 16-34 at a distance of ten thousand feet
(10,000') to the periphery of the conical surface.
5. Transitional Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the
runway centerline and centerline extended at a slope of seven to one (7:1) from the sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of
the approach surfaces until they intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the
precision instrument approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') measured horizontally from the edge of the precision instrument approach surface and at right angles to the
extended precision instrument runway centerline.
B. Height Restrictions:
1. Restrictions Imposed: Except as otherwise provided in this article and except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no
structure or tree shall be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in any airspace zone created in subsection A of this
section so as to project above any of the imaginary airspace surfaces described in said subsection A. Where an area is covered by more
than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitations shall prevail; provided, however, with respect to those areas covered by
subsection B2b of this section, the least restrictive limitations shall prevail. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
2. Exceptions:
a. In those areas where existing terrain or trees penetrate one or more of the imaginary airspace surfaces, the height of the structures
shall be restricted to the height of the imaginary airspace surface or to the height of the tree canopy which provides a natural shield to
the structure, whichever is the greater height. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004; amd. 2008 Code)
b. In those areas described in subsection B3 of this section, the highest point of a structure shall be restricted to the height of the
imaginary airspace surface or to one hundred feet (100') above the existing terrain, whichever is the greater height, provided it is
determined by the federal aviation administration that no hazard will result from the structure being erected. The elevation from which
the one hundred feet (100') shall be measured shall be determined by adding the lowest elevation of the existing terrain under the
proposed structure and the highest elevation of the existing terrain under the proposed structure and dividing by two (2). Existing
terrain shall be that shown on the topographical surveys prepared by Mark Hurd, which shall be on file in the office of the airport
zoning administrator.

courts, campgrounds, and other places of frequent public or semipublic assembly.
4. Zone C: Zone C is subject only to height restrictions set forth in subsection 10-13H-2B of this article, and to the general restrictions
contained in subsection A of this section.
5. Exemptions For Established Residential Neighborhoods:
a. Land uses which existed as of July 2, 1979, in the established residential neighborhoods set forth in subsection A4 of this section,
and as shown on the zoning map, are subject to the height restrictions of subsection 10-13H-2B of this article and the general
restrictions of subsection A of this section. Land uses which come into existence after July 2, 1979, are treated as though they were
not in a designated established residential neighborhood and are subject to the zone A or zone B restrictions as the case may be.
b. Land uses in established residential neighborhoods which violate any of the following restrictions are prohibited as safety hazards and
must be acquired, altered or removed at public expense. Those conditions are as follows: The following land uses, if they exist in
safety zone A or B and in an established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area, are considered by the commissioner of
transportation to constitute airport safety hazards so severe, either to persons on the ground or to the air traveling public, or both, that
they must be prohibited under local airport zoning ordinances:
(1) Any structure which a person or persons customarily use as principal residence and which is located entirely inside safety zone A
within one thousand feet (1,000') of the end of the primary zone;
(2) Any structure which a person or persons customarily use as a principal residence and which is located entirely within safety zone
A or B and which penetrates an imaginary approach surface as defined by subsection 10-13H-2A of this article;
(3) Any land use in safety zone A or B which violates any of the following standards:
(A) The land use must not create or cause interference with the operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio
or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft;
(B) The land use must not make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights;
(C) The land use must not result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport or impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
(4) Any isolated residential building lot zoned for single-family or two-family residences on which any structure, if built, would be
prohibited by subsections B5b(1), (2), and (3) of this section. An "isolated residential building lot" is one located in an area in which
the predominant land use is single-family or two-family residential structures; and
(5) Any other land use which presents, in the opinion of the commissioner of transportation, a material danger to the landing, taking off
or maneuvering of aircraft or to the safety of person(s) on the ground. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall
consider the following factors:
(A) Possibility that the land use may contribute to or cause a collision of two (2) or more aircraft or an aircraft and some other object;
(B) Possibility that the land use may, in case of an aircraft accident, cause an explosion, fire or the release of harmful or noxious
fumes, gases or substances;
(C) Tendency of the land use to increase the number of persons that would be injured in case of an aircraft accident;
(D) Effect of the land use on availability of clear areas for emergency landings; and
(E) Flight patterns around the airport, the extent of use of the runway in question, the type of aircraft using the airport, whether the
runways are lighted, whether the airport is controlled, and other similar factors.
C. Boundary Limitations: The land use restrictions set forth in this article shall apply for a distance not to exceed one mile beyond the
perimeter of the airport boundary and in that portion of an airport hazard area under the approach zone for a distance not exceeding two

(2) miles from the airport boundary. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-4: AIRPORT ZONING MAP:
The several zones herein established are shown on the South St. Paul airport zoning districts map, prepared by the Inver Grove Heights
planning division, and dated March 24, 1999, available in the planning division offices, which map, together with such amendments thereto, as
may from time to time be made, and all notations, references, elevations, data, zone boundaries, and other information thereon, shall be and
the same is hereby adopted as part of this article. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-5: NONCONFORMING USES:
The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any
structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any
nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two (2) years
thereof. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-6: PERMITS REQUIRED:
A. Future Uses:
1. Except as specifically provided in subsections A2 and A3 of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no
structures shall be erected, altered, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been
applied for and granted by the zoning administrator, hereinafter provided. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to conform to the regulation herein prescribed. If such determination is
in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
2. However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in
the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of four thousand two hundred
feet (4,200') from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features,
would extend the height or land use limit prescribed for the respective zone.
3. Nothing contained in subsection A2 of this section shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or
growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations as set forth in section 10-13H-2 and the land use limitations set
forth in section 10-13H-3 of this article.
B. Existing Uses: Before any existing use or structure may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established
herein, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date hereof, or any amendments hereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except as indicated, all applications for such permit shall be granted.
C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming structure or tree, for
purposes of this article, has been abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
Whether application is made for a permit under this subsection or not, the zoning administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or
partially destroyed nonconforming structure, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner
necessary to conform to the provisions of this article. In the event the owner of the nonconforming structure shall neglect or refuse to
comply with such order for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of such order, the zoning administrator may, by appropriate legal
action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and
assess the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was located. Unless such an assessment is paid within
ninety (90) days from the service of notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per
annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes. (Ord.
1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-7: VARIANCES:
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the airport board of adjustment and appeals, hereinafter provided, for a variance
from such regulations. If a person submits an application for a variance by certified mail to the members of the airport board of adjustment and
appeals, and the airport board of adjustment and appeals fails to grant or deny the variance within four (4) months after the last member
received the application, the variance shall be deemed to be granted by the airport board of adjustment and appeals. When the variance is
granted by reason of the failure of the board to act on the variance, the person receiving the variance shall notify the board and the
commissioner of transportation, by certified mail, that the variance has been granted. The applicant shall include a copy of the original
application for variance with this notice to the commissioner. The variance shall be effective sixty (60) days after this notice is received by the
commissioner, subject to any action taken by the commissioner, pursuant to Minnesota statutes section 360.063, subdivision 6a. Such
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 431/526
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship, and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the
spirit of this article, provided any variance so allowed may be subject to any reasonable conditions that the board or commissioner may deem
necessary to effectuate the purpose of this article. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-8: HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING:
A. Nonconforming Uses: The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the zoning administrator to indicate to the operators of
aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the city of South St. Paul.
B. Permits And Variances: Any permit or variance granted by the zoning administrator or airport board of adjustment and appeals, as the case
may be, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, so condition
such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question, at his own expense, to install, operate, and maintain
thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

ARTICLE J. NORTHWEST AREA OVERLAY DISTRICT
10-13J-1: FINDINGS:
The city finds that the northwest area of the community presents unique development challenges and opportunities. Its varied physical
topography, areas of extensive tree cover and numerous landlocked, defined wetland basins not only are valued natural features, but also
would likely increase the costs for storm sewer infrastructure if a traditional storm water management plan were implemented. The "Northwest
Quadrant Study" (prepared by Hoisington Koegler Group, 2001) and "Northwest Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis" (prepared by
Emmons & Olivier Resources, 2004) indicate that alternative land planning, engineering and development practices may be more cost
effective in addressing infrastructure needs and meeting the city comprehensive plan goal of preserving unique natural areas/open space.
(Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 434/526
A. The northwest area overlay district is established for the purpose of regulating development consistent with the city comprehensive plan
while creating a cost efficient storm sewer system. In accordance with the city comprehensive plan and the "Northwest Quadrant Study:
City Of Inver Grove Heights And South Robert Trail Neighborhood Association" (prepared by Hoisington Koegler Group in 2001), the
northwest area overlay district will encourage development which provides:
1. Diverse housing styles;
2. Natural features as integral elements;
3. Cluster development practices which preserve significant natural features;
4. Pedestrian connections;
5. Innovative storm water management practices;
6. A reduction in impervious cover to maximize natural storm water infiltration;
7. On site retention of storm water; and
8. Open space areas as development amenities.
B. The provisions of the northwest area overlay district will also reduce the amount of storm water runoff from the district through minimizing
impervious surface coverage. Provisions will also maximize the ability to infiltrate storm water without piping to a remote outlet (i.e.,
Mississippi River) through the preservation of natural areas for infiltration.
C. All development within the northwest area overlay district shall be by planned unit development according to: 1) the platting procedures as
established in the city subdivision ordinance, title 11, chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this code; 2) the planned unit development procedures
established in article A of this chapter; and 3) the provisions found in this article. If there are any conflicts in these standards, the most
restrictive standard shall apply, unless specifically approved otherwise by the city council. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-3: SEWER AND WATER ISSUES:
A. No Municipal Water And Sewer Currently In District; Density Requirements:
1. The northwest area overlay district does not have municipal sewer or water available as of the effective date hereof. As municipal sewer
and water become available to properties in the northwest area overlay district, development shall be allowed subject to this article. Until
such time as municipal sewer and water become available and final planned unit development plans are approved by the city for the
specific property, densities shall not exceed one unit per ten (10) acres. All lots of record existing on the effective date hereof shall be
governed by the lot size regulations for the underlying zoning district within which the lot of record is located.
2. The maximum density of one unit per ten (10) acres is established for properties that do not yet have municipal sewer and water in
order to:
a. Prevent parcelization of land before municipal sewer and water become available.
b. Reduce the density of residential development in areas lying outside the area of the city where municipal utilities are available in order
to prevent the untimely, noncost effective extension of city utilities due to the failure of on site septic systems.
c. Prevent adverse effects upon the environment due to the failure of on site waste disposal systems.
d. Promote the provision of residential lot areas that more easily facilitate resubdivision when city utilities become available, particularly
in those areas where utility extensions may occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.
e. Lessen the potential demand in the rural areas for city services such as police and fire protection and street and park services.
f. Channel development of significant tax base into the areas of the city that have municipal sewer.
B. Subdivision Of Property Not Served By Municipal Sewer And Water:
1. Subdivision of property in the northwest area overlay district that is not served by municipal sewer and water shall be allowed only under
the following conditions:
a. The subdivision shall be memorialized through platting. No waiver of plat or administrative subdivision procedure shall be allowed.
b. A property must have a minimum of twenty (20) acres (excluding existing right of way) in order to be subdivided.
c. The subdivision shall result in a density no greater than one home per ten (10) acres of land (excluding proposed right of way).
d. The resulting plat shall include buildable lots of a size no less than one (1.0) acre and no greater than one and one-half (1.5) acres.
The remainder of the property shall be platted as an outlot or outlots. The outlot(s) shall be considered unbuildable, and no further
subdivision of the outlot(s) shall be allowed until such time as municipal sewer and water become available to the property. When
municipal sewer and water become available to the property, the outlot(s) may develop, but will be required to develop according to:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 435/526
1) the platting procedures as established in the city subdivision ordinance, title 11, chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this code; 2) the planned
unit development procedures established in article A of this chapter; and 3) the provisions found in this article.
e. The underlying zoning district of the property to be subdivided shall be rezoned to agricultural/PUD.
2. Planned unit development procedures and standards set forth in article A of this chapter shall not apply to land divisions that are eligible
for subdivision according to the provision of this subsection. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-4: BOUNDARIES; APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
A. The northwest area overlay district, further defined herein, is hereby established as a part of this title. The northwest area overlay district
shall be an overlay district such that any parcel lying in the overlay district shall also lie within one or more of the underlying zoning
districts. Regulations and procedures set forth in underlying zoning districts shall apply unless specifically addressed in article A of this
chapter or this article or if determined by the city council to be inconsistent with the purpose and intent outlined in section 10-13J-2 of this
article, approved by the city council as part of the final planned unit development plans. For purposes of determining the application of this
article, the boundaries of the northwest area overlay district shall be established and shown on the official zoning map of the city, on file in
the office of the city clerk and zoning administrator. Said map and the boundaries shown thereon are hereby incorporated herein by
reference with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007; amd. 2008 Code)
B. Structures existing on or before the effective date hereof shall be exempt from the standards set forth within the northwest area overlay
district until such time as the parcel is subdivided. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-5: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
All development in the northwest area overlay district shall be pursuant to an approved final PUD plan, except as allowed in subsection 10-
13J-3B of this article. The procedures and regulations set forth in article A of this chapter (planned unit development district) shall apply
unless specifically addressed in this section. The following subsections are hereby deemed to be requirements for all PUDs in the northwest
area overlay district unless exceptions as part of a PUD are otherwise approved by the city council based on the project's ability to protect
public safety, the purpose and intent of this article as outlined in section 10-13J-2 of this article, and the purpose and intent as outlined in
section 10-13A-1 of this chapter. The city council must also determine that the exceptions are consistent with the goals, policies, and plans of
the city comprehensive plan, including future land uses, utilities, streets and parks; the exceptions are generally compatible and would not be
materially injurious to existing or future uses of surrounding properties; and the exceptions do not have an undue adverse impact on existing
or planned city facilities and services, including streets, utilities, parks, police and fire and the reasonable ability of the city to provide such
services in an orderly, timely manner.
A. Minimum Area: There is no minimum required site size for a PUD in the northwest area overlay district. However, all land in the PUD must
be contiguous unless specifically approved otherwise by the city council based on the criteria identified in this section.
B. Ownership: The tract of land may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownerships. However, when a tract is held in
multiple ownerships, it shall be planned as a single entity with common authority and common responsibility as demonstrated through all
property owners being signatories on the PUD application.
C. Bulk Standards:
1. All perimeter setbacks of a PUD shall conform to the setbacks of the underlying zoning district. Property in a PUD shall conform to the
bulk standards established in table 13J-1 of this section
2. Except as provided in table 13J-1 of this section, all other setbacks of a PUD shall conform to the setbacks of the underlying zoning
district.

Mixed Use As defined through the final PUD plans as approved by the city council
Notes:
1. Maximum density is calculated based on net developable area (see section 10-13A-6 of this chapter and subsection E of this section).
However, in no instance shall the density exceed that established for the property in the city comprehensive plan, and such density limits
are incorporated by reference and hereby made a part of this article. The comprehensive plan refers to gross density. The northwest
area overlay refers to net density as described in subsection E2b of this section.
2. Rear yard setbacks shall follow the underlying zoning district setback standards.
3. Impervious surface percentages shall be applied to the whole project during planning stages. The PUD shall establish a standard for
each individual lot regulated during the permitting process.
4. In no instance may a building (principal or accessory) lie within an area of the lot encumbered by an easement.
D. Natural Area/Open Space:
1. An amount of land equal to at least twenty percent (20%) of the net developable area within the PUD shall be preserved as natural
area/open space, which may include greenways as shown in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Natural Resources Inventory And
Management Plan" (Bonestroo Rosene Anderlik & Associates, 2004).
2. Natural area/open space shall be designated in the following priority order:
a. The first priority is to protect slopes of twenty five percent (25%) or greater in those subwatersheds that have a significant portion of
their drainage area (30 percent or more) covered in slopes of twenty five percent (25%) or greater. The following subwatershed
districts have thirty percent (30%) or more of the developable area covered by slopes greater than twenty five percent (25%): BP-032,
EP-016e, EP-016g, EP-025b, EP-027d, EP-027f, EP-035b, EP-049b, EP-049e, SP-17 and SP-29 as identified in the "Northwest
Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis", completed by Emmons & Oliver Resources in 2004.
b. The second priority is to incorporate public trails or public open space designated in the comprehensive plan. This would be in
addition to any land that would be used to satisfy the public park dedication requirement found in the city subdivision ordinance, title
11 of this code.
c. The third priority for natural area/open space designation is the protection of natural features such as slopes of twenty five percent
(25%) or greater, and environmentally sensitive areas and scenic features of the site identified as manage 1 or 2 resources or priority
sites in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Natural Resource Inventory And Management Plan For The Northwest Expansion Area"
(Bonestroo Rosene Anderlik & Associates, 2004).
d. The fourth priority is to create natural area/open space in and around neighborhoods. This priority is satisfied by providing continuity
of adjacent natural area/open space corridors or parkways; network of interconnected natural area/open space corridors; or buffers
between incompatible or conflicting land uses.

3. At least seventy five percent (75%) of the required natural area/open space shall be contiguous with no portion less than one hundred
feet (100') wide, unless otherwise approved by the city council based on the criteria identified in this section.
4. At least fifty percent (50%) of the required natural area/open space shall be maintained in a natural, undisturbed condition with native
vegetation and shall not be graded or improved with any building, structure or other impervious surface, except: a) public utilities; b)
limited access in the form of a paved walking or hiker/biker path, the total impervious area of which shall not be more than two percent
(2%) of the total required natural area/open space; and c) unless otherwise approved by the city council based on the criteria identified
in this section.
5. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of designated required natural area/open space may be used for passive or active recreation, public
or private utilities or the location of storm water management features. If used for active recreation, impervious cover shall not exceed
five percent (5%) of the remaining area. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of designated required natural area/open space may be
graded.
6. The entire area set aside for natural area/open space shall be maintained in perpetuity. This restriction shall run with the land and be
binding on successors and assigns of the landowner.
7. The boundaries of designated natural area/open space and recreation areas shall be clearly delineated on the approved final PUD
plans. These areas shall be delineated in the field with signage approved by the city.
8. The designated natural area/open space may be owned and managed by one or more of the following:
a. Property owner, provided either: 1) the deed to each lot includes a proportionate share of the natural area/open space or common
facilities; or 2) an easement for the natural area/open space is provided for the benefit of the lots in the subdivision.
b. Homeowners' association, provided all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The homeowners' association must be established prior to filing of any plats.
(2) Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive buyer.
(3) The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and maintenance of the natural area/open space.
(4) Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the
property in accordance with Minnesota statutes.
(5) The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs.
c. Third party (nonprofit) organization whose primary purpose is to hold or manage the natural area/open space, subject to a
reversionary clause in the event of dissolution of the nonprofit organization.
d. Dedicated to the city, if the city council determines there is a demonstrated public need.
9. The maintenance of the natural area/open space shall be the responsibility of one of the entities identified in subsection D8 of this
section. Public storm water or utility improvements may be located within a portion of the natural area/open space, as specified in
subsections D4 and D5 of this section, in which case, the city shall be responsible for maintenance of that portion of the natural
area/open space.
10. Authorized representatives of the city may conduct inspections at any reasonable time to ensure proper maintenance of such areas
and/or to respond to citizen complaints.
11. The legal instrument creating the restrictions, easements and covenants in the natural area/open space shall be subject to approval by
the city, and the instrument recorded with the county shall state that the restrictions, easements and covenants shall not be terminated
or altered without the written consent of the city. The legal instrument creating the restrictions, easements and covenants in the natural
area/open space shall be enforceable by the city, and the documents shall recite the city's right of enforcement.
12. If the property to be subdivided contains natural resources identified as manage 1 or 2 resources or priority sites in the "City Of Inver
Grove Heights Natural Resource Inventory And Management Plan For The Northwest Expansion Area" (Bonestroo Rosene Anderlik &
Associates, 2004), the city council may, at its discretion, require the manage 1 or 2 resource or priority site to be encumbered with a
conservation easement to the public. Said conservation easement would include at least the following provisions:
a. No vegetation shall be removed or mowed from the easement area, except for invasive vegetation species when removed according
to a plan approved by the city.
b. No private structures may be placed within the easement area.
c. No grading shall be allowed, except as approved with the final planned unit development plan, or subsequent city approved
amendments thereto.
d. No gardening shall be permitted within the easement area.
e. Public utilities shall be permitted within the easement area.
E. Development Capacity Plan Required:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 438/526
1. A development capacity plan shall be prepared by the developer as part of the preliminary development plan for every residential
project. The intent of the development capacity plan is to determine the total number of units that could be developed on the site
according to the underlying zoning district regulations which may be established through the sketch plan process. The total unit count
determined through the development capacity plan shall then become the maximum number of units permitted under the northwest area
overlay district regulations. The total number of units for the overall project shall not exceed the density as establish through the
comprehensive plan.
2. Calculation of the total number of permitted residential units shall be determined in the following manner:
a. Step 1: Determine the total net developable area (in acres) per the definition of "net developable area" as found in section 10-2-2 of
this title.
b. Step 2: Divide the developable area determined in step 1 above by the minimum lot area as established for the applicable underlying
zoning district and found in chapter 9, articles A and B and sections 10-9C-1, 10-9C-2 and 10-9C-3 of this title. The result is the total
number of units that could be developed on the site in the underlying zoning district. The total number of units divided by the net
developable area equals the net density of the site.
c. Step 3: The total number of units determined in step 2 above shall be the maximum number of units permitted under this article.
F. Allowed Uses:
1. Except those uses identified in subsection G of this section as interim uses, all permitted, conditional, and accessory uses, as defined,
regulated and administered for the underlying zoning districts, shall continue and remain in effect within the northwest area overlay
district. If a final PUD plan is approved by the city council, the underlying zoning for the subject property shall be amended according to
the approved PUD plan, though the overlay district shall remain the northwest area overlay district. The permitted uses shall then be
those found in the amended underlying zoning district. PUD developments in the northwest area overlay district are allowed to have an
increased mixture of housing types, provided that the provisions of this article are met. Table 13J-2 of this section identifies which uses
are permitted and the maximum percentage of the total development units which can be of that housing type. The total number and
location of housing units and housing types for a specific property shall be established by the city council at the time of final PUD plan
approval for that specific property. The location and number of housing units approved on the final PUD development plan shall not be
altered without approval of the city council.

Multiple dwelling unit building (4 or fewer units) 10 percent 30 percent 100 percent 40 percent 100 percent
Multiple dwelling unit building (5+ units) 0 percent 0 percent 50 percent 100 percent 100 percent
Note: The percentages in the above table represent the total maximum percent of units allowed by unit type or use in each district. For
example, in the R-1C district, up to 30 percent of the total units in the proposed PUD may be twin homes or two-family dwellings, or
alternatively, the entire PUD could consist of all (100 percent) single-family housing.
2. Within the overlay district, multiple dwelling units, including townhouses, shall be a permitted use, provided they follow the performance
standards as specified in chapter 15 of this title (specifically those in articles B and C), those specified in this article, the requirements of
the underlying zoning districts, and the approved final PUD plans.
G. Interim Uses:
1. Purpose And Intent: The northwest area overlay district is envisioned to develop at urban development densities over the next twenty
(20) or more years. The premature development of this area in an estate type development pattern (large residential lots with sizes of
21/2 to 5 acres with private sanitary sewer systems and private wells) presents challenges to the efficiency and coherency of future
development. In addition to rural development patterns, rural uses (boarding of horses, agriculture, etc.) that are incompatible with urban
development will also pose challenges to the orderly development of the northwest area planned unit development overlay district.
Consequently, it is the purpose of this subsection to establish interim uses that are appropriate to the northwest area overlay district
while preserving the reasonable use of private property.
2. Uses Requiring Interim Use Permit: Regardless whether the following uses are permitted or conditional uses in the underlying A
agricultural zoning district, the following uses shall be considered interim uses in the northwest area overlay district and shall require
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 439/526
approval of an interim use permit by the city council pursuant to the procedures established in chapter 14 of this title:
Agriculture buildings.
Commercial greenhouse/nurseries.
Commercial horse stables.
Commercial kennels.
H. Storm Water Management1:
1. Design: All development in the northwest area overlay district shall be designed such that storm water runoff is managed on site within
the planned unit development to match predevelopment runoff, as demonstrated by matching predevelopment and postdevelopment
runoff volume for the 5-year, 24-hour event. The storm water system shall also have managed overflows to the regional system of
natural depressions such that the storm water rainfall/runoff for a 100-year event is safely transported. Contingencies for emergency
overflows at least one foot (1') below the lowest structure shall be provided.
a. For any proposed PUD development, the developer shall submit a storm water management plan which contains supporting
computations, drawings and sufficient information describing the manner, location and type of measures in which storm water runoff
will be managed from all phases of the PUD development. The developer shall also submit soil borings for the site including proposed
storm water infiltration areas.
b. The storm water management plan shall be prepared by an individual whose qualifications are acceptable to the city. The city may
require that the design be prepared by a professional licensed in the state of Minnesota as necessary to protect the public or the
environment.
c. Storm water management plans shall use one or more of the following features to address on site storm water management. These
measures shall be designed in accordance with the most recent version of the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual"
which is incorporated by reference into this article. The performance criteria specified in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater
Manual" shall be considered when selecting the appropriate management features such as:
(1) Infiltration rainwater gardens (encumbered by public easement and maintained by the city).
(2) Vegetated swales (encumbered by public or private easement and maintained by the city or private parties, as approved by the
city, together with the final PUD plans and storm water management plan).
(3) Parking lot bioretention (encumbered by a private easement if found necessary by the city and maintained by private parties).
(4) Infiltration basins/trenches (encumbered by public or private easement and maintained by the city or private parties, as approved
by the city, together with the final PUD plans and storm water management plan).
(5) Disconnection of impervious surfaces, e.g., diverted roof leaders, rain barrels, permeable pavement. (These features are to be
encumbered by a private easement if found necessary by the city and maintained by private parties.)
(6) Green roofs (private maintenance).
(7) Other low impact development (LID) techniques.
d. Storm water management plans will stage construction and specifically address temporary erosion and sediment control measures to
preserve the infiltration capacity of proposed on site and regional storm water management features to ensure that such features are
not impaired at conclusion of construction.
e. Storm water easements over those storm water management features that the city chooses to maintain shall be provided by the
property owner for access, facility inspections, replacements, and public maintenance. The easements shall be fully executed and
submitted to the city prior to the release of the final plat from city offices for recording by the county.
f. Covenants and/or maintenance agreements found acceptable to the city relating to all storm water management features not to be
maintained by the city shall be provided by the property owner. The covenants and/or maintenance agreements shall be fully executed
and submitted to the city prior to the release of the final plat from city offices for recording by the county.
g. The legal instrument creating the restrictions, easements and covenants governing privately maintained storm water management
facilities shall be subject to approval by the city, and the instrument recorded with the county shall state that the restrictions,
easements and covenants shall not be terminated or altered without the written consent of the city. The legal instrument shall be
enforceable by the city, and the document shall recite the city's right of enforcement.
h. Final design of the storm water management plan shall be approved by the city council and shall be filed in the chain of title for each
property that lies within the planned unit development. A condition of approval shall be that the landowner shall enter into a license
contract with the city allowing authorized representatives from the city to conduct inspections on a regular basis at any reasonable
time to assure the safe and proper functioning of the private storm water management features and/or to respond to citizen concerns.
The license contract shall also permit authorized representatives of the city to enter upon the private property for the purpose of
correcting or maintaining any private storm water management feature approved as a part of the storm water management plan if,
after proper and reasonable notice by the city to the landowner, the landowner has not corrected or maintained the storm water
management feature to the standards established in the approved storm water management plan, the most recent version of the "City
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 440/526
Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" and/or this article. Moreover, the license contract shall permit the city to certify the costs
of the maintenance/correction to the taxes for the subject private property.
2. Ownership:
a. The boundaries of storm water management features shall be clearly delineated on all plans, including final PUD plans, preliminary
plats and final plats.
b. The designated storm water management features may be owned by one or more of the following:
(1) Property owner, provided the deed to each lot includes a proportionate share of the storm water management features.
(2) Homeowners' association, provided all of the following conditions are met:
(A) The homeowners' association must be established prior to any sale.
(B) Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive buyer.
(C) The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and maintenance of the storm water management
features.
(D) Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on
the property in accordance with Minnesota statutes.
(E) The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs.
(3) Third party (nonprofit) organization whose primary purpose is to hold or manage the stormwater management features, subject to
a reversionary clause in the event of dissolution of the nonprofit organization.
(4) The city will accept ownership by easement of the stormwater management features, including rainwater gardens, when the
features serve as a part of the larger regional or neighborhood stormwater management needs as defined by the "Northwest
Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis" completed by Emmons & Olivier Resources in 2004 or the "Northwest Area Alternative
Urban Areawide Review" prepared by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates in 2005. The city will not accept ownership of such
features as downspouts, cisterns, green roofs, parking lot bioremediation or other such systems or features interior to the parcel.
3. Maintenance:
a. Maintenance of all stormwater features encumbered by public easements as described in subsection H1e of this section shall be the
responsibility of the city according to the measures outlined in the most recent version of the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater
Manual".
b. All stormwater features that are not encumbered by public easements as described in subsection H1e of this section shall be
maintained according to the covenants and/or maintenance agreements approved by the city pursuant to subsection H1f of this
section, the stormwater management plan approved by the city with the planned unit development, the development contract
approved by the city, together with the planned unit development, and the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" plans.
(Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
4. Inspections:
a. Authorized representatives of the city may conduct inspections at reasonable times throughout the construction process to meet the
specifications in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" and the stormwater management plan approved by the city,
together with the planned unit development plans. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007; amd. 2008 Code)
b. Authorized representatives from the city may conduct inspections on a regular basis at any reasonable time to assure the safe and
proper functioning of the features and/or to respond to citizen concerns. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
5. Stormwater Manual Adopted: All the contents, provisions and terms of the "Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Stormwater Manual",
dated July 2006, prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, are hereby adopted and made a part of this code. The adoption of said
stormwater manual includes adoption of all the chapters and appendices thereof. The stormwater manual is fully incorporated by
reference. For the convenience of the public, the stormwater manual shall be kept in a book separate from this title so that the
stormwater manual may be more easily distributed and made available for public inspection. The contents, provisions and terms of the
stormwater manual shall constitute this subsection H5. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
a. Amendment: The definition of impervious surface contained in appendix C of the "Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Stormwater
Manual" dated July 2006, prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, as codified in subsection H5 of this section, is hereby amended
to read as follows:
Impervious Surface. The term impervious surface, for purposes of the Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Stormwater Manual, shall
have the same meaning as that term is defined by Inver Grove Heights city code section 10-2-2.
(Ord. 1180, 9-8-2008)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 441/526
I. Procedures:
1. Sketch Plan: Preparation of a sketch plan by the developer is strongly encouraged. Given the site design complexities of the northwest
area overlay district, a sketch plan should be prepared and submitted for each development. Without a thoroughly prepared sketch plan,
the likelihood increases that the preliminary development plan application will be found inadequate by the city. The sketch plan should
be prepared following the submittal requirements outlined in subsection 11-2-5A of this code. In addition, the sketch plan should include
the following elements: a) a preliminary stormwater management concept should be provided in outline format identifying desired
techniques for the development proposal based upon the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual"; b) identification of the
natural resources as included within the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Natural Resource Inventory And Management Plan For The
Northwest Expansion Area" (Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates, 2004); c) a conceptual development capacity plan as described
in subsection E of this section; and d) a conceptual scaled natural area/open space plan identifying all natural area/open spaces as
required in subsection D of this section. The sketch plan should be prepared and presented to city staff thirty (30) days prior to submittal
of the preliminary PUD plan.
2. Preliminary Development Plan: A preliminary development plan shall be prepared and submitted by the developer. It shall include: a) a
preliminary plat prepared pursuant to subsection 11-2-5B of this code; b) a preliminary PUD development plan prepared pursuant to
subsection 10-13A-11A of this chapter; c) a stormwater management plan consistent with the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater
Manual" and consistent with the stipulations provided in subsection H of this section; d) a development capacity plan as described in
subsection E of this section; and e) a scaled natural area/open space plan identifying all natural area/open spaces as required in
subsection D of this section.
3. Final Development Plan: A final development plan shall be prepared and submitted by the developer. It shall include: a) a final plat
prepared pursuant to subsection 11-2-5C of this code; b) a final PUD development plan prepared pursuant to subsection 10-13A-11B of
this chapter; and c) the final development plans in the northwest area overlay district shall follow the procedures outlines in section 9-5-6
of this code. No physical alteration or improvement of the property may commence until after the final development plan and
development contract are approved by the city council, except that site grading may begin earlier if the city council approves a land
alteration permit for the grading. The location and number of units approved in the final plan shall not be altered without approval of the
council through an amendment process. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-6: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
Developments shall follow the standards of chapter 15 of this title unless otherwise addressed in this section.
A. Site Landscaping: Within the northwest area overlay district, the use of native vegetation for landscaping is encouraged in common areas.
Areas preserved with natural landscaping shall be maintained in accordance with local and state regulations governing control of noxious
weeds. Mass grading for landscaping areas shall be avoided to reduce compaction of natural area/open space areas.
B. Off Street Parking And Loading:
1. Joint Parking: Joint parking arrangements are encouraged in the northwest area overlay district.
2. Off Site Or Remote Parking Facilities: Within the northwest area overlay district, remote parking is permitted so long as it is within
reasonable walking distance to the principal use and it does not require crossing major physical barriers such as freeways, four-lane
arterials, water bodies or other nonpedestrian friendly features. Reasonable walking distance is considered no more than a one-eighth
(1/8) mile (660 feet) or a five (5) minute walk.
3. Parking Surfaces: Parking surfaces may be made of pervious materials such as pavers, pervious asphalt or concrete or other
technology as identified in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual". These areas shall still be considered as impervious
surfaces for storm water calculations; however, up to fifty percent (50%) of pervious pavement areas will be credited toward the twenty
percent (20%) natural area/open space requirements (see subsection 10-13J-5D1 of this article). Pervious material surfaces shall be
clearly delineated on the approved final PUD plans. Long term redevelopment and maintenance must preserve the pervious pavement
surface.
4. Parking Lot Curbing: Curbs shall be designed to meet the standards set forth in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" so
as to ensure safety and best management of storm water. Generally, curbs shall either be flat or have breaks at regular intervals to
convey runoff into the storm water system unless a storm water management plan demonstrates that another curbing system meets
storm water management performance objectives.
5. Minimum And Maximum Number Of Permitted Off Street Parking Spaces:
a. Subsection 10-15A-3J of this title establishes a minimum number of required off street parking spaces for various land uses. With the
exception of single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings, this article reestablishes the minimum required off street parking spaces
and establishes a maximum allowed number of parking spaces as well.
b. The minimum required off street parking spaces shall be no less than seventy five percent (75%) of the minimum parking required by
subsection 10-15A-3J of this title. Pervious paving materials shall be used for the portion of parking over the minimum required off
street parking spaces.
c. The maximum allowed off street parking spaces shall be no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the minimum parking required
by subsection 10-15A-3J of this title. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 442/526
d. The maximum allowed off street parking identified above may be exceeded by no more than ten percent (10%) of the total number of
parking spaces, provided that at least fifty percent (50%) of the total parking lot surface area is paved with a pervious material
consistent with techniques identified in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" or fifty percent (50%) of the parking
spaces are in a deck structure or underground. Parking in excess of the maximum shall be done with pervious paving materials. (Ord.
1148, 5-29-2007; amd. 2008 Code)
6. Parking For Multi-Family Residential (Including Townhomes) And Mixed Use: Fifty percent (50%) of total parking required for multifamily
and mixed use development shall be underground parking, tuck-under parking or structured parking within or under the principal
structure. The intent of this regulation is to minimize impervious surface that would result from surface parking lots.
7. Proof Of Parking: Developments that can accommodate parking allotments less than the minimum parking spaces required may do so,
provided that the final PUD plan includes the identification of area dedicated for future parking needs to satisfy the minimum parking
needs.
8. On Street Parking: Where on street parking is available, parking spaces that are adjacent to the lot frontage of the subject use may be
counted towards the off street parking requirement.
9. Parking Lot Landscaping: Surface parking lots in excess of one hundred (100) spaces shall provide landscaped islands between
contiguous bays of parking. Such landscaped islands shall also serve as a storm water cell and shall be designed according to the
guidelines established in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" (chapter 8, pages 14 and 91).
C. Driveways:
1. Driveway widths for single-family detached residential dwellings, two-family and twin home dwellings shall be no more than twenty feet

ARTICLE K. LOT SIZE AND BULK STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF
PUBLIC LAND
10-13K-1: FINDINGS:
The city finds that the minimum lot sizes and bulk standards for the zoning districts may not rationally relate to the nature and function of
certain types of public land. Unless an exception is created for certain public lands, the minimum lot sizes and bulk standards for the zoning
districts would apply in instances where the public lands were owned in fee title by a governmental unit, as opposed to the governmental unit
having an easement only. (Ord. 1246, 11-14-2011)
10-13K-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of this article is to create an exception for certain public lands from the minimum lot size and bulk standards for the
underlying zoning districts. (Ord. 1246, 11-14-2011)
10-13K-3: EXEMPTIONS:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this title, in instances where the public land is owned in fee by a governmental unit, the following
types of public land are exempt from the lot size requirements and bulk standards for the underlying zoning districts:
A. Trails.
B. Streets.
C. Areas restricted to open space or conservation land.
D. Stormwater ponds and stormwater facilities. (Ord. 1246, 11-14-2011)
Chapter 14

ARTICLE D. TREE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION DURING LAND
ALTERATION1
10-15D-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this article is to provide for minimal tree loss and mitigation of tree removal in wooded areas of the city. Tree cover is beneficial
in terms of aesthetics, screening, cooling, wildlife habitat, watershed control, air quality enhancements, erosion control and preservation and
enhancements of property values. Land alteration that causes large scale destruction of trees diminishes and impairs the public health, safety
and general welfare. The intention of this article is to provide regulations relating to the cutting or removal of trees in areas where the natural
vegetation or topography are to be significantly altered. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-2: WOODLAND PROTECTION STANDARDS:
No land alteration within a woodland shall occur until the city finds that the land alteration complies with the following:
A. Maximum Possible Preservation: The land alteration shall be conducted so that the maximum amount of woodland is preserved by the
clustering of structures wherever possible, or by the use of other innovative design techniques where appropriate. Measures shall be taken
to protect and preserve the preservation area as described in the city's "Guidelines For Preventing Construction Damage".
B. Protection Of Root Zones: Grading, contouring, paving, and any excavation or trenching, as well as parking of vehicles, material storage,
dirt stockpiling and other similar activities, shall not occur within or detrimentally affect the aeration or permeability of the root zone in the
preservation area. The "root zone" shall be understood to mean the area within a radius surrounding the tree trunk of one foot (1') per one
inch (1") of tree diameter.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 473/526
C. Data Submission: The applicant shall submit data at the time of preliminary plat submission to the city that outlines conformance to this
article. The data shall include:
1. Inventory of all significant and heritage trees by species, diameter and condition.
2. Proposed building pad location for each lot including custom graded lots.
3. Identification of significant and heritage trees to be preserved.
4. Identification of significant and heritage trees to be removed, including those to be removed in the future for a proposed building pad by
a developer or builder.
5. Identification of all significant and heritage trees within the thirty foot (30') grading limit.
D. Removal Thresholds:
1. Although the applicant must retain the maximum amount of woodland possible, the city recognizes that a certain amount of significant
trees and tree cover removal is an inevitable consequence of the urban development process.
2. Therefore, in the following zoning districts listed in column I, a percentage of the woodland may be removed without any obligation for
reforestation, but only up to and including the threshold percentage of woodland listed in column II. If the land alteration results in
woodland removal that is less than the percentage thresholds of column II, then the applicant shall be given, for each percent under the
thresholds, a credit of one percent (1%), up to a maximum of ten percent (10%), toward the total park dedication or park contribution
requirement of sections 11-4-5 and 11-4-6 of this code. If the land alteration results in woodland removal that exceeds the percentage
listed in column II, then the applicant shall be responsible for reforestation in accordance with the standards of this article.
Column I
Zoning District
Column II
Threshold
A 25 percent
E-1 and E-2 25 percent
R-1A, R-1B, R-1C and R-2 30 percent
R-3A, R-3B, R-3C and R-3D 40 percent
B-1, B-2 and P 50 percent
B-3, B-4, I-1 and I-2 60 percent
E. Reforestation:
1. If the land alteration results in woodland removal beyond the woodland removal threshold, the applicant shall be required to submit a
reforestation plan. The reforestation plan must be submitted prior to final plat approval. The reforestation plan shall include:
a. Location of proposed reforestation.
b. Species and size of proposed plantings.
c. Quantity of proposed plantings.
2. The reforestation plan shall comply with the following criteria:
a. Tree replacement will be predicated on total number of diameter inches of significant and heritage trees removed beyond the
threshold limits outlined in subsection D of this section.
b. Actual replacement quantities shall be adjusted based on the type of woodland removed in accordance with the following guidelines:
(1) Class A, fast growing deciduous species, predominantly aspen, Siberian elm, American elm, silver maple, red maple, willow: fifty
percent (50%).
(2) Class B, conifer/mixed hardwoods, predominantly pine, spruce, cedar and mixed hardwoods consisting of the following species:
oak, birch, sugar maple, black cherry, basswood, ironwood, walnut, ash, hackberry, locust: one hundred percent (100%).
(3) Class C, heritage tree: one hundred percent (100%). For each heritage tree saved, the developer may receive credit towards the
required replacement trees. This credit will be at a rate of two (2) caliper inches for each one dbh inch saved. To receive this credit,
the applicant must demonstrate that extraordinary measures have been taken to preserve the heritage trees that otherwise would
not be saved.
c. Species replacement must meet site landscaping requirements (subsection 10-15-11A of this chapter). Consideration should be given
to a replacement tree species' potential to disease, and emphasis on planting diversity should be encouraged.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 474/526
d. Where heritage trees have been removed, replacement trees shall consist of the same species as the removed heritage tree, or a
tree that has the same potential value as the removed heritage tree. This value shall be certified by a certified forester or arborist. For
the purposes of this subsection E2d, "value" is defined as a species which has the same growth and life potential as the removed tree.
e. Required replacement trees shall be planted on the site being developed in areas such as yard setbacks and outlots. These trees
shall be planted based on the frequency and density as determined by the city. Unless found otherwise, at least seventy five percent
(75%), but in no case less than forty five percent (45%), of the required tree placement shall occur on the site being developed.
Should the development not have sufficient room on the site to allow for all required reforestation, the balance may, at the city
council's discretion, either be: 1) planted upon public property in locations approved by the city; or 2) a cash payment to the city in an
amount equivalent to the cost of the plantings, said payment to be used by the city for future plantings on public property.
f. The reforestation plan shall be reviewed by the city planner and shall be considered by the city council as part of final plat approval.
g. The actual replacement quantities for woodlands located on commercial and industrial developments in tax increment financing
districts may be reduced according to such factors as: the stated purposes for creation of the subject tax increment district, need for
tax base generation in the tax increment district, and mandatory landscaping requirements as specified in the city's landscaping
policy. The city administrator shall review each such proposal prior to final plat approval and make a recommendation to the city
council on the actual percentage of replacement that will be required. At the time of final plat approval, the city council shall make a
final decision regarding actual replacement quantities based upon the factors listed above. In no instance will the replacement rate be
less than ten percent (10%) for class A species and twenty five percent (25%) for class B and C species, as defined in subsection E2b
of this section.
F. Construction Damage To Significant Trees In Or Near Preservation Area: Significant and heritage trees which are within thirty feet (30') of
the proposed grading limits shall be surveyed by the applicant. Any significant or heritage tree that the applicant commits to preserve that
is subsequently damaged, during or as a result of construction, shall be replaced by the applicant on a one for one diameter inch basis.
G. Pruning Trees: Owners or developers pruning oak trees between April 15 and August 1 must apply an appropriate nontoxic wound sealant
to any cut areas.
H. Landscape Security:
1. The applicant shall post with the city a landscape performance bond or cash deposit or letter of credit in an amount equal to one
hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the cost of the plantings, plus installation, when the land alteration exceeds the woodland
removal threshold limit. The bond shall ensure adherence to the requirements of this article.
2. The performance security shall remain in effect for at least one year after the date that the last replacement tree has been planted. The
city may release the performance security at that time unless the city planner, upon inspection, finds that any of the replacement trees
have died or are unhealthy, or if there was any encroachment upon the protective fencing surrounding any tree to be saved. The city
may retain that portion of the performance security equal to the cost of removing dead or unhealthy trees and replanting replacement
trees. If the applicant supplies proof of a nursery guarantee which is approved by the city planner, then the performance security posted
by the applicant shall be released upon planting of the last guaranteed tree. The nursery guarantee shall remove liability from the
applicant, and responsibility will be placed upon the nursery or current landowner. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-3: REPLACEMENT TREES:
Replacement trees shall be planted no more than twelve (12) months after the date that land alteration has commenced. If the applicant is
prevented from performing within this time limit because of unforeseeable reasons beyond the applicant's control, the city planner may extend
the time for performance. The applicant shall inform the city planner when all replacement trees have been planted, at which time, the city
planner shall inspect the site. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-4: EDUCATION:
The city parks and recreation director shall develop an education program which shall be distributed to applicants and all general contractors
prior to receiving a contractor's license from the city. The information shall include, but not be limited to, prevention of construction damage to
trees, tree replacement, pruning, general tree protection techniques and tree disease information. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-5: EXEMPTIONS:

I. Dynamic Display Billboards:
1. Findings, Purpose And Intent: The city council finds it necessary for the promotion and preservation of the health, safety, welfare, and
aesthetics of the community that the construction, location, size, conspicuity, brightness, legibility, operational characteristics and
maintenance of dynamic display billboards be controlled. Dynamic display billboards have a direct and substantial impact on traffic
safety, pedestrian safety, community aesthetics and property values. The city council recognizes that signs provide a guide to the
physical environment and as such serve an important function in the community and economy. With respect to dynamic display
billboards, including video display billboards, the city council finds that they are highly visible from long distances and at very wide
viewing angles both day and night and are designed to catch the eye of persons in their vicinity and hold it for extended periods of time.
If left uncontrolled, dynamic display billboards, including video display signs, constitute a serious traffic safety threat. Studies such as
"'Dynamic' Signage: Research Related To Driver Distraction And Ordinance Recommendations" by SRF Consulting Group, Inc., June 7,
2007, reveal that electronic signs are highly distracting to drivers and that driver distraction continues to be a significant underlying
cause of traffic accidents. The city council intends by this subsection to establish a legal framework for dynamic display billboard
regulation in the city. The regulations promulgated in this subsection are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable communication
between people while protecting and promoting the public health, safety, welfare and aesthetics of the community. It is not the purpose
or intent of this subsection to prefer or favor commercial messages or speech over noncommercial messages or speech or to
discriminate between types of noncommercial speech or the viewpoints represented therein. Rather, the purpose of the dynamic display
billboard regulations promulgated in this subsection is:
a. To eliminate potential hazards to motorists and pedestrians using the public streets, sidewalks, and rights of way;
b. To safeguard and enhance property values;
c. To control nuisances;
d. To preserve and improve the appearance of the city through adherence to aesthetic principles, in order to create a community that is
attractive to residents and to nonresidents who come to live, visit, work, or trade;
e. To eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays;
f. To encourage signs which by their design are integrated with and harmonious to the surrounding environment and the buildings and
sites they occupy; and
g. To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Location Of Dynamic Display Billboards: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained within this code, dynamic display billboards
may be located only within the billboard overlay district. Dynamic display billboards are prohibited in all zoning districts of the city other
than the billboard overlay district. Dynamic display billboards located in the billboard overlay district must comply with all code
requirements for permitted dynamic display billboards.
3. Nonconforming Billboards: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained within this code, a legal nonconforming sign or billboard
shall not be converted to a dynamic display billboard unless the legal nonconforming sign or billboard is located in the billboard overlay
district. A legal nonconforming sign or billboard may be continued through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or
improvement but shall not be expanded, enlarged, intensified or moved to a new location. Replacement, reconstruction, or restoration
means construction that exactly matches preexisting conditions. Expansion or intensification includes, but is not limited to, replacement
of a static display with any type of dynamic display, including a display that consists of rotating, revolving, moving, flashing, blinking, or
projecting items, or light bulbs, LED lights, fiber optics, or any other method of technology that allows the sign face to present a series of
text, images, or displays. A legal nonconforming sign or billboard may be converted to a dynamic display billboard in the billboard
overlay district subject to the requirements of the billboard overlay district performance standards.
4. Billboard Overlay District Performance Standards: The billboard overlay district is hereby established as a separate zoning district within
the city. Within the billboard overlay district, dynamic display billboards are permitted subject to the following conditions:
a. No dynamic display billboard shall be erected that, by reason of position, shape, movement or color, interferes with the proper
functioning of a traffic signal or which constitutes a traffic hazard.
b. Dynamic display billboards must have minimum display duration of eight (8) seconds. Such display shall contain static messages
only; change from one static message to another shall be instantaneous without any special effects, through dissolve or fade
transitions, or with the use of another subtle transition technique that does not have the appearance of moving text or images.
c. Dynamic display billboards must be rectangular in shape and all messages must be contained within the billboard frame.
d. All dynamic display billboards shall have ambient light monitors installed as part of the billboard and shall, at all times, allow such
monitors to automatically adjust the brightness level of the electronic sign based on light conditions.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 478/526
e. Dynamic display billboards shall meet the following brightness standards:
(1) No dynamic display may be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility, and shall not exceed seven thousand five
hundred (7,500) nits (candelas per square meter) between the hours of civil sunrise and civil sunset and shall not exceed five
hundred (500) nits (candelas per square meter) between the hours of civil sunset and civil sunrise as measured from the face of the
sign.
(2) The lamp wattage and luminance level in nits (candelas per square meter) shall be provided at the time of permit application from
the owner or operator of the sign certifying that the sign shall at all times be operated in accordance with all relevant provisions of
this code and that the owner or operator shall provide written proof of such conformity within five (5) business days after request
from city staff.
f. Dynamic display billboards shall have a fully functional monitoring off switch system that automatically shuts the dynamic display
billboard off when the display deteriorates, in any fashion, five percent (5%) or greater until the dynamic display sign has been
repaired to its fully functional factory specifications.
g. Dynamic display billboards shall maintain a minimum spacing of eight hundred feet (800') between any other dynamic display
electronic billboard on the same side of the highway and five hundred feet (500') between signs on the opposite side of the highway.
h. Dynamic display billboards must be part of the state of Minnesota's public safety alert system.
i. Applicants for a dynamic display billboard permit shall enter into an agreement with the city to provide the city no less than five (5)
hours (provided in two thousand two hundred fifty 8-second spots) per month per dynamic display billboard face in the city for
community and public service messages at such times as shall be determined by the city. This agreement must be approved by the
city council before a permit for the construction or conversion of a dynamic display billboard may be issued by the building official.
5. Rezoning Of Property: Contemporaneous with the enactment of this subsection, the city has rezoned certain property within the city to
the billboard overlay district by ordinance 1229. The area rezoned to the billboard overlay district is the only appropriate area in the city
for dynamic display billboards because the city adopted an ordinance in 1993 regulating the location of billboards to an area along
Highway 52/55 in sections 27 and 34, Township 27, Range 22. Supreme court decisions and results from numerous safety studies have
indicated that dynamic display billboards and other forms of outdoor signage are intended to divert, and do divert, a driver's attention
from the roadway. Dynamic display billboards have been considered a form of visual pollution that can detract from the positive features
of a community.
The property located within the city of Inver Grove Heights which has been rezoned to be located in the dynamic display billboard
overlay district is as follows: All of sections 27 and 34, Township 27N, Range 22W, Dakota County, Minnesota. (Ord. 1228, 1-24-2011)

necessary by the city council for traffic safety reasons. The directional signs shall be located outside of the public right of way and shall
maintain a ten foot (10') setback from all property lines. The directional signs shall only be permitted during the season when the stand is
open for business and shall be of a size as determined by the city council.
E. Any sign with over one square foot of surface shall be set back at least ten feet (10') from any property line. No sign shall exceed ten feet

ARTICLE F. ADULT USES
10-15F-1: PURPOSE:
The nature of adult uses is such that they are recognized as having adverse secondary characteristics, particularly when they are accessible
to minors and located near residential property or related residential uses such as schools, daycare centers, libraries or parks. Furthermore,
the concentration of adult uses has an adverse effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. The nature of adult uses requires that
they not be allowed within certain zoning districts, or within minimum distances from each other or residential uses. Special regulation of adult
uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse secondary effects will not contribute or enhance criminal activity in the area of such uses nor will
it contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding property and the lessening of its value. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

profession, or material used in the performance of the work. Any required work failing to meet such standards shall not be deemed to be
complete, and the applicant shall be notified in writing as to required corrections. Upon determination that the work has been completed,
including the winter season survivability of all landscape improvements, a notice of the date of actual completion shall be given to the
applicant, and appropriate action to release or to reduce the amount of the financial guarantee shall be taken by the zoning
administrator. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

Chapter 17
OUTDOOR BURNERS/BOILERS
10-17-1: RESTRICTIONS FOR OUTDOOR BURNERS/BOILERS:
A. Findings: The city council of the city of Inver Grove Heights adopts the following findings concerning outdoor burners/boilers and the need
to prohibit new outdoor burners/boilers:
1. Wood smoke is one of the chief causes of certain types of air pollution in the United States. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood
Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p. 6)
2. Residential wood smoke contains fine particles and toxic air pollutants (e.g., benzene and formaldehyde). ("Strategies For Reducing
Residential Wood Smoke", outreach and information division, air quality planning division, office of air quality planning and standards,
U.S. environmental protection agency, October 29, 2009, p. 4)
3. Outdoor wood burners/boilers may emit significant pollution because the basic design of the outdoor wood burner/boiler causes fuel to
burn incompletely, or smolder, which results in thick smoke and high particulate emissions. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood
Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p. 5)
4. Smoke emitted from outdoor wood burners/boilers can cause or contribute to short term health harms such as eye, nose, throat and
lung irritation, coughing and shortness of breath, and may exacerbate asthma or trigger asthma attacks. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs:
Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau, August
2005, p. 5)
5. Chronic exposure to smoke can cause long term effects such as asthma, heart and lung disease, and cancer. ("Smoke Gets In Your
Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau,
August 2005, p. 5)
6. There is public concern about the use of older technology hydronic heaters (also known as outdoor wood boilers) and their growing use,
particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. ("Strategies For Reducing Residential Wood Smoke", outreach and information division, air
quality planning division, office of air quality planning and standards, U.S. environmental protection agency, October 29, 2009, p. 4)
7. As traditional sources of fuel (e.g., natural gas and heating oil) prices have gone up over the last several years, the purchase and use of
wood fired hydronic heaters, also known as "outdoor wood boilers" have increased. ("Strategies For Reducing Residential Wood
Smoke", outreach and information division, air quality planning division, office of air quality planning and standards, U.S. environmental
protection agency, October 29, 2009, p. 6)
8. Outdoor wood burner/boiler chimneys are often short and thus do not carry the smoke past the heights of neighboring homes, thus
resulting in undispersed smoke and more concentrated pollution at lower elevations. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood
Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p. 5, 12)
9. The United States environmental protection agency does not currently regulate the manufacture, sale, or efficiency claims of outdoor
wood burners/boilers. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 506/526
York state, environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p. 17)
10. In light of the significant harm that wood smoke can present, the city council finds that the burning of other similar plantbased materials
poses similar risks when burned in outdoor burners/boilers.
11. Given the potential for significant harm to residents' health, the city council hereby finds and declares that outdoor burners/boilers
constitute a public nuisance.
B. Definitions:

Chapter 4
PARK, TRAIL AND RECREATION DEDICATION OR CASH IN LIEU
11-4-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. The city council recognizes it is essential to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city and persons working in the city that
the character and quality of the environment be considered to be of major importance in the planning and development of the city. In this
regard, the manner in which land is developed and used is of high priority. The preservation of land for park, playground and public open
space purposes as it relates to the use and development of land for residential and commercial/industrial purposes is essential to
maintaining a healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city. The city must not only provide these necessary amenities for
our citizens today, but also be insightful to the needs of future citizens.
B. The city council recognizes that the demand for park, playground, trail and public open space within a municipality is directly related to the
density and intensity of development permitted and allowed within any given area. Urban type developments mean greater numbers of
people and higher demands for park, playground and public open space. To disregard this principle is to inevitably overtax existing
facilities and thus, diminish the quality of the environment for all.
C. The city parks and recreation advisory commission has established minimum community criteria for meeting the needs of the residents of
the city. In order to meet the community needs for parks, ten (10) acres of park shall be required for each one thousand (1,000) residents.
This shall be the standard upon which the city shall establish its park land dedication and parks cash contribution.
D. It is the policy of the city that the standards and guidelines of this chapter for the dedication of land for park, playground and public open
space purposes (or cash contributions in lieu of such dedication) in the subdividing and developing of land within the city shall be directly
related to the density and intensity of each subdivision and development.
E. The state has recognized the importance of providing for parks and open space in Minnesota statutes section 462.358, subdivision 2(b),
which clearly gives the right to the city in its subdivision regulations to require reasonable portions for public use. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-2: DEDICATION OR CASH IN LIEU REQUIRED:
As a prerequisite to subdivision approval, subdividers shall dedicate land for parks, playgrounds, public open spaces, and trails and/or shall
make a cash contribution to the park acquisition and development fund as provided by this chapter. Final approval of the park
dedication/contribution requirements shall be made by the city council. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-3: SUITABILITY OF LAND:
Dedicated land shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use, and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served, and shall be
consistent with the "Comprehensive Park Plan And Development Guide Plan" used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and
recreation areas. These factors shall include size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access and location. Land with dead
trees, trash, junk, pollutants and unwanted structures is not acceptable, unless the developer first removes the unacceptable material. (Ord.
1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-4: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
A. Parks And Recreation Advisory Commission Recommendation: Prior to the preliminary plat approval, the parks and recreation advisory
commission shall recommend to the city council the land and/or cash contribution requirements for proposed subdivision.
B. Change In Density: Any increase in density of a platted or proposed subdivision shall be reviewed by the parks and recreation advisory
commission and the council for reconsideration of park land and/or cash contribution requirements.
C. Additional Purchase: When a proposed park, playground, recreation area, or other public ground is indicated in the city's official map or
adopted comprehensive plan and is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, it shall be designated as such on the plat. If
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 522/526
the subdivider elects not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required hereunder for such proposed public site, the city may consider
acquiring the site through purchase.
D. Relationship To Other Open Space: The amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider shall be based on the gross area of the proposed
subdivision. The amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider shall be based on the density of development. Such dedication shall be
consistent with the comprehensive plan and "Comprehensive Park Plan And Development Guide Plan" for future parks.
E. Partial Credit: Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be used
for partial credit, at the discretion of the city council, against the land or cash dedication requirement for park and recreation purposes,
provided the city council finds it is in the public interest to do so.
F. Change Of Requirements: The city, upon consideration of a particular type of development, may require larger or smaller parcels of land
than provided in section 11-4-5 of this chapter to be conveyed to the city if the city determines that present or future residents would
require greater or lesser land for park and playground purposes. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-5: LAND DEDICATION:
A. In a subdivision where a land dedication is required, the following formula will be used as a guide to the park land dedication requirements
which shall be made at time of final plat approval:
Zoning District
Land Dedication
(Percentage Of Land To Be Dedicated To The City)
A and E-1 and E-2 To be determined by council at time of final plat
R-1 and R-2 9
R-3A and R-3B 18
R-3C 30
B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 4.5
I-1 and I-2 4.0
P 4.5
Pursuant to Minnesota statutes 462.358, subdivision 2b(a), the percentages shown above shall be multiplied by the buildable land within the
subdivision. For this calculation, the "buildable land" means the area being subdivided remaining after excluding those portions that are either:
1. Encumbered by right of way for arterial roads as defined in the Inver Grove Heights comprehensive plan;
2. Lying below the ordinary high water level of public waters as identified in the shoreland management overlay district (see title 10,
chapter 13, article B of this code); or
3. Lying within the boundaries of wetlands delineated according to the Minnesota wetland conservation act; or
4. Bluffs in shoreland management overlay districts abutting public waters.
When outlots are part of the subdivision and are intended to be replatted into buildable lots in the future, the percentages of dedication
shown above shall not be applied to the land area within the outlots; when the outlots are later replatted into buildable lots, the
dedication percentages shall then be applied. If the outlots are not intended to be replatted, but are intended to remain as outlots, the
dedication percentages shown above shall be applied to the land area contained in such outlots.
B. Land proposed to be dedicated for public purposes shall meet identified needs of the city as contained in the "Comprehensive Park Plan
And Development Guide Plan" and the comprehensive plan.
C. Prior to dedication, the subdivider shall deliver to the city attorney a title insurance commitment and a title insurance policy in favor of the
city. The dedicated land shall be conveyed by warranty deed. Such title shall vest in the city good and marketable title, free and clear of
any mortgages, liens, encumbrances, assessments and taxes. The conveyance documents shall be in such form acceptable to the city.
D. The required dedication and/or payment of fees in lieu of land dedication shall be made at the time of final plat approval.
E. The removal of trees and topsoil, the storage of construction equipment, the burying of construction debris, and stockpiling are strictly
forbidden without the written approval of the director of parks and recreation.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=542 523/526
F. Grading and utility plans which may affect or impact the proposed park dedication shall be reviewed and approved by the parks and
recreation director prior to dedication, or at such time as reasonably determined by the director of parks and recreation.
G. 1. To be eligible for park dedication credit, land dedicated must be located outside of drainways, floodplains or ponding areas. Land with
grades exceeding twelve percent (12%) or unsuitable for parks development shall be considered for partial dedication.
2. Where ponding has been determined by the city council to have a park function, credit will be given at a rate of fifty percent (50%) of the
pond and adjoining land area below the high water level. A minimum of seventy percent (70%) of land above the high water mark shall
be dedicated before pond credit is granted. Other city park dedication policies relating to pond dedication must also be complied with.
3. In those cases where the subdividers and developers of land provide significant amenities such as, but not limited to, swimming pools,
tennis courts, handball fields, etc., within the development for the benefit of those residing or working therein, and where, in the
judgment of the director of parks and recreation, such amenities significantly reduce the demands for public recreational facilities to
serve the development, the director of parks and recreation may recommend to the parks and recreation advisory commission and the
city council that the amount of land to be dedicated for park, playground, and public open area space (or cash contributions in lieu of
such dedication) be reduced by an amount not to exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the amount calculated under this section.
H. The city may determine that the subdivider create and maintain some form of on site recreation use by the site residents such as tot lots
and open play space. This requirement may be in addition to the land or cash dedication requirement.
I. The subdivider must provide finished grading and ground cover for all park, playground, trail and public open spaces within the development
as part of the development contract or site plan approval responsibilities. Landscape screening shall be in accordance with city policy.
J. The subdivider must establish park boundary corners for the purpose of erecting park limit signs. The developer shall contact the
appropriate parks and recreation department personnel for the purpose of identifying park property corners.
K. The subdivider must provide sufficient public road frontage of not less than three hundred feet (300') for neighborhood parks and additional
frontage for community parks. (Ord. 1277, 2-24-2014)

I-1 and I-2 5,000.00
Pursuant to Minnesota statutes 462.358, subdivision 2b(a), the per acre contribution shall be applied to the portion of buildable land in the
subdivision; for this calculation, the buildable land means the area being subdivided remaining after excluding those portions that are either:
1. Encumbered by right of way for arterial roads as defined in the Inver Grove Heights comprehensive plan;
2. Lying below the ordinary high water level of public waters as identified in the shoreland management overlay district (see title 10,
chapter 13, article B of this code); or
3. Lying within the boundaries of wetlands delineated according to the Minnesota wetland conservation act; or

C. Review Of Rates: Cash dedication rates will be reviewed annually and established by ordinance of the city council.
D. Already Existing Residential Unit: If the subdivision includes a residential unit that existed prior to the subdivision and if that already existing
residential unit previously paid a park contribution or was constructed at a time that this code did not require a park contribution fee, then
that particular residential unit shall not be subject to the park contribution fee imposed by this section. (Ord. 1277, 2-24-2014)
11-4-7: COMBINATION OF CASH AND LAND:
The city and developer may arrange a combination of cash, land, and/or development of the land for park purposes to fulfill the
dedication/contribution requirements. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
