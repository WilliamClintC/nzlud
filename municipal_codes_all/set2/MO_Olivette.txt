including special assessments on applicable property.
3. In acting on any new application or on any reapplication by an
applicant whose prior permit, license, franchise or other approval

permit, license, franchise or other requested approval in question
and the need for the City to rely on representations and/or future
conduct by the applicant when acting pursuant to the permit,
license, franchise or other requested approval by the City, the
reviewing or enforcement officer may deny the application or
reapplication if the past violations of relevant law are reasonably
recent in time and of such character or magnitude as to reasonably
call into question the fitness of the applicant or the City's ability to
rely on representations and/or future conduct by the applicant.

suspended, revoked or forfeited, the applicant may not submit a
new application for one (1) year from the date of the denial,
suspension, revocation or forfeiture unless the reviewing or
enforcement officer finds that substantial new facts or a change in
circumstances warrant reconsideration; provided however, that if
the ordinances governing the particular permit, license, franchise
or other approval in question prescribe a different disqualification
period, those ordinances shall govern.
5. Any aggrieved applicant may appeal the decision of the reviewing
or enforcement officer to the City Manager within five (5) business
days of said decision. The City Manager may reverse or modify the
decision of the reviewing or enforcement officer provided the
applicant:
a. Establishes a good faith effort to effect compliance with this
Section and any relevant law,
b. Establishes an inability to effect compliance with any relevant
law because of the ownership structure of any pertinent
related entity, if the denial in question was due to conduct or
circumstances of a related person or entity, or
c. Establishes that the applicant has not been charged with a
violation of relevant law or is or, if applicable, was not in
violation of relevant law.
A. For purposes of this Section, the term “dishonored instrument” means
any check, draft, order, or other instrument submitted to the City for
the payment of taxes, fees, penalties, or other debts or sums due the
City which is subsequently returned to the City for insufficient funds or
because there is no account or the account has been closed, or because
such check, draft, or order was returned because of a stop-payment
order placed on the check, draft or order.
B. The City Council shall establish a fee from time to time to recoup the
City’s costs for service charges incurred and for staff time required to
Section
100.180
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
100.190

the employees of the bargaining unit.

bargaining unit, by secret ballot election more than once in any
consecutive twelve-month period.
A. A petitioner may withdraw a petition for certification at any time prior
to seventy-two (72) hours before a scheduled election. If the petition is
withdrawn prior to the scheduling of an election, the withdrawal shall
serve to bar the petitioner from refiling the withdrawn petition or from
filing a similar petition for six (6) months from the date of withdrawal. If
the petition is withdrawn after the scheduling of an election, the
withdrawal shall serve to bar the petitioner from refiling the withdrawn
petition or from filing a similar petition for twelve (12) months from the
date of withdrawal.

determine that they no longer wish to be represented by a recognized
agent, they may revoke their designation by tendering a signed and
dated petition for revocation to the Council. Upon receipt of such a
petition, the City Manager and two (2) Council members appointed by
the Mayor shall determine if the petition is authentic. Upon the report
of the committee, if the petition is determined to be authentic, the
Council shall then revoke recognition of the labor organization as the
bargaining agent for that bargaining unit.
A. If a bargaining unit is represented by a certified agent, the City
Manager and the affected department head, or any other negotiators
appointed by the Council, shall meet with the agent to confer and
discuss wages, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment
with the goal of reaching a mutually satisfactory proposed collective
bargaining agreement to be submitted to the Council for its

the meeting or vote, and the specific exception for permitting such
closure, shall be announced publicly and entered into the minutes.

necessary for the specific reason(s) announced to justify the closed

specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote is
prohibited.

portion of the meeting facility necessary to house the members of the
public governmental body in the closed session, allowing members of
the public to remain to attend any subsequent open session held by the
body following the closed session.

appears to be terrorist in nature and which has the potential to
endanger individual or public safety or health. The City states that
the disclosure of such information would impair the City's ability to
protect the security or safety of persons or real property, and the
public interest in non-disclosure outweighs the public interest in
disclosure of such records. Financial records related to the

pose a clear and present danger to the safety of any victim, witness,
undercover officer, or other person, or jeopardize a criminal
investigation, including records that would disclose the identity of a

in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to
communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or
unloading. A public school district has the authority pursuant to Section
304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as
to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic; nor
shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is
upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a
speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different
roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway
containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a
loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or
controlled access highway at a point where pedestrians are not
permitted to cross the roadway.

vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall
mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in

an ordinance violation.
D. Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the
insured motor vehicle or by the operator of the motor vehicle if the
proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator rather
than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall
exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the
officer's or inspector's duties.
E. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the
operator demonstrates to the court that he/she met the financial
responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at the time the
Peace Officer wrote the citation.
F. Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of
an ordinance violation and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished

C. Facilities Regulations.
1. The following general regulations apply to the placement and
appearance of facilities:
a. Facilities shall be placed underground, except when other
similar facilities exist above ground or when conditions are
such that underground construction is impossible, impractical
or economically unfeasible as determined by the City and when
in the City's judgment the above ground construction has
minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is
proposed. Facilities shall not be located so as to interfere, or be
likely to interfere, with any public facilities or use of public
property.
b. Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or
eliminate their visibility. Non-residential zoning districts are
preferred to residential zoning districts. Preferred locations in
order of priority in both type districts are:
(1) Thoroughfare landscape easements,
(2) Rear yards, and
(3) Street side yards on a corner lot behind the front yard
setback. Placements within side yards not bordered by a
street or within front yards are discouraged.
c. Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright,
reflective or metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be considered
neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the
facilities. Sightproof screening, landscape or otherwise, may
be required for facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or
covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such
screening shall be sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility.
A landscape plan identifying the size and species of
landscaping materials shall be approved by the Director prior
Section
400.1225
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.1225
AO:505
to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening.
The person responsible for the facilities shall be responsible
for the installation, repair or replacement of screening
materials. Alternative concealment may be approved by the
Director to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these
requirements.
d. Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner
and so as to not emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and in
accordance with all applicable provisions of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety
Code and all other applicable Federal, State or local laws and
regulations.
e. No person shall place or cause to be placed any sort of signs,
advertisements or other extraneous markings on the facilities,
except such necessary minimal markings approved by the City
as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair,
maintenance or emergency purposes or as may be otherwise
required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation.
f. If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for
facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts with the
reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director shall
cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find
suitable alternatives, but the City shall not be required to incur
any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the applicant.
2. Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing or
operating facilities, and the person on whose behalf the work is
being done, shall protect from damage any and all existing
structures and property belonging to the City and any other person.
Any and all rights-of-way, public property or private property
disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or
replaced and the responsible person shall immediately notify the
owner of the fact of the damaged property. Such repair or
replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified
by the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
3. The applicant shall provide written notice, at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior to any installation, replacement or expansion of its
facilities, to the owner of the property on which the work is to be
performed and to the owners of all adjoining properties. Notice
shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be done,
the location of work and the time and duration of the work.
4. At the City's direction, a person owning or controlling facilities
shall protect, support, disconnect, relocate or remove facilities, at
its own cost and expense, when necessary to accommodate the
construction, improvement, expansion, relocation or maintenance

of streets or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public
health, safety or welfare.
5. If a person installs facilities without having complied with the
requirements of this Chapter or abandons the facilities, said person
shall remove the facilities and if the person fails to remove the
facilities within a reasonable period of time, the City may, to the
extent permitted by law, have the removal done at the person's
expense.

b. The name, phone number and address of the applicant and the
owner of the property, if other than the applicant;
c. The nature of the disability that requires the reasonable
accommodation. If the individuals expected to reside at the
property are not known to the applicant in advance of making
the application, the applicant shall submit details describing
the range of disabilities that prospective residents are
expected to have to qualify for the housing. The applicant shall
notify the director if, when identified, the prospective residents
are not within the range initially described. The director shall
then determine if an amended application and subsequent
determination of reasonable accommodation is appropriate;
d. The specific accommodation requested by the applicant,
including the number of people who are expected to be
availing themselves of the accommodation, the estimated
number of people in an average week who will be necessary to
provide services to the person(s) with disabilities at the

any permit or license from any Federal, State, or local
authority to operate, the anticipated impact the
accommodation is likely to have on the adjoining properties
and area, and any other information that would assist in
determining the reasonableness of the accommodation; and
e. Whether the accommodation is necessary to afford one (1) or
more disabled persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
specific dwelling.
2. The director may require the applicant to provide additional
relevant and reasonable information deemed necessary for a
complete accommodation application, and the director may
reasonably supplement the application as deemed appropriate.
3. If the information provided by the applicant to the director includes
medical information of a disabled person, including records
indicating the medical condition, diagnosis or medical history, the
applicant may, at the time of submitting such information, request
that the director, to the extent allowed by law, treat such medical
information as confidential information. The director shall provide
written notice to the applicant of any request for disclosure of
confidential medical information. The City will cooperate with the
applicant, to the extent allowed by law, in actions initiated by the
applicant to oppose the disclosure of such medical information.
D. Determining The Reasonableness Of An Accommodation.
1. On compilation and reduction to writing of the relevant and

present evidence on his or her behalf. The director shall also have
the right to be heard, as shall any intervening party claiming to
have an interest adverse to the applicant.
3. Testimony presented at the hearing shall be sworn, and rules of
evidence shall be followed, as determined by the board. All
proceedings before the board shall be recorded. The applicant shall
have the right to request reasonable accommodation in the hearing
process.

application of either party to the proceedings, shall require, the
attendance of any City employee or officer and shall have the right
to order the production of any City records relating to the
accommodation request. The board may request additional
relevant and reasonable information deemed necessary for its
complete consideration of the accommodation request and may
continue the hearing, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, for
the purpose of receiving such information.
5. At the conclusion of the hearing, and after consideration of the
evidence before it, the board shall either grant the accommodation
as requested, grant the accommodation as modified, or deny the
accommodation. The board's determination shall be in writing and
shall include these minimum findings, in addition to any other
findings or conclusions deemed relevant by the board:
a. Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to afford
one (1) or more disabled persons equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a specific dwelling;
b. Whether the requested accommodation would require a
fundamental alteration to the City's zoning scheme; and
c. Whether the requested accommodation would impose undue
financial or administrative burdens on the City.
6. A request for accommodation shall not be denied for any reason
that violates the Acts. The board is not obligated to grant any
accommodation request unless so required by the Acts or by
applicable Missouri law.

denial of said application is pending, the City will not enforce the
subject zoning regulation against the applicant.

Non-Conforming Uses
Section 400.1280. Intent and Purpose. [R.O. 2008 §280.130]
A non-conforming land use or structure is one which existed lawfully on the
date this Chapter or any amendment thereto became effective and which
fails to conform to one (1) or more of the applicable use regulations of the
zoning ordinance or such amendment thereto.
Section 400.1290. Non-Conforming Use — When Permitted. [R.O.
2008 §280.132]
The lawful use of land or building(s) existing at the effective date of this
Chapter or any amendment thereto may be continued although such use
does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter or amendment thereto.
A non-conforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or more restricted classification. Whenever a
non-conforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted
use.
Section 400.1300. Limitations On Non-Conforming Use. [R.O. 2008
§280.138]
No structure or any part thereof devoted to a non-conforming use shall
be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, except when
required to do so by law or order, unless the use is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which the structure is located.
Section 400.1310. Building Containing Non-Conforming Use
Damaged or Destroyed. [R.O. 2008 §280.140]
A. When a building, the use of which does not conform to the provisions of
the zoning ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or the
public enemy to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its
reasonable value, it shall not be restored except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which the building is located, provided that
it may be restored if the Board of Adjustment finds some compelling
public necessity requiring the continuance of the non-conforming use
and the primary purpose of continuing the non-conforming use is not to
continue a monopoly.
B. Any multi-family building or group of multi-family buildings under
single ownership and their accessory uses which become nonconforming
upon the adoption of this Chapter may be reconstructed or
repaired to its pre-existing configuration, provided that such
restoration in no way increases the non-conformity.

three hundred fifty (350) square feet per gross automobile
parking space shall be applied.
c. In calculating any required parking area, other than for
detached or attached single-family dwellings, sufficient access
and maneuver space shall be provided to permit the parking
and removal of any vehicle without moving other vehicles.

so allocated, be used to satisfy the space requirements for any
off-street parking facilities or portions thereof.
e. If there is any uncertainty with respect to the amount of
parking space required by the provisions of this Code as a
result of any indefiniteness as to the proposed use of a building
or of land, the maximum requirement for the general type of
use that is involved shall govern.
4. Modification of the parking required. The total amount of parking
space required for a given lot or parcel may be reduced by site plan
review as provided in Article XI, under the following
circumstances. In any development where a mixture of residential
uses and office or retail uses is permitted, the combined total

2. Satellite dish antennas are generally larger in surface area and are
more obtrusive and unsightly than other types of antennas and
have correspondingly greater impact on the aesthetics of
residential neighborhoods; and
3. Satellite dish antennas raise unique safety concerns because the
parabolic dish traps wind, subjecting the antenna to a higher
amount of wind force than other types of antennas and thus
requires unique placement considerations; and
4. The City's regulation of the installation of satellite dish antennas is
necessary to diminish the visual impact of such antennas in
residential areas and to ensure safe placement of such structures in
the City.
Accordingly, this Section shall apply to any exterior dish-type
antenna used to receive or transmit television, radio or other
electronic signals, which is larger than two (2) feet six (6)
inches, in any linear dimension.
B. A building permit may be issued for any dish-type antenna as defined in
Subsection (A) above which does not present an obtrusive or unsightly
appearance so as to detract from residential neighborhood aesthetics
and an installation of which does not constitute a health or safety
hazard. The following standards shall apply:
1. The dish antenna shall be located only within the buildable area of
a rear yard or side yard of a lot, as those terms are defined in the
City's zoning ordinance.
2. The dish antenna shall be ground mounted and all associated
wiring shall be placed underground.
3. The dish antenna shall be limited to a maximum of eight (8) feet in
any linear dimension and to a maximum height of nine (9) feet
above the ground. The area of the installation shall not be elevated
by a berm or hill.
4. The dish antenna shall be visually screened year-round from all
directions beyond the lot lines by landscaping, existing structures,
sightproof fencing or similar methods. All such screening installed
shall be continuously maintained in satisfactory condition.
5. The dish antenna and all structural supports shall be painted to
minimize visual impact.
6. There shall be a maximum of one (1) dish antenna per lot in
residential zoning districts.
7. All dish antenna installations shall also comply with all the
applicable provisions of the Building Code and the Zoning Code of
the City of Olivette including electrical permit requirements.

C. Notwithstanding anything in Subsection (B) hereof to the contrary, a
dish antenna may be located on the roof of a commercial building or
structure, subject to prior review and approval of the Planning and
Community Design Commission as herein provided. No diameter of any
such dish antenna shall exceed six (6) feet and no such dish antenna
shall extend more than seven (7) feet above main roof level, except that
on commercial buildings or structures over eighty-five (85) feet in
height, any such dish antenna:
1. May be up to ten (10) feet in diameter; and
2. May extend up to nineteen (19) feet above main roof level.
The Planning and Community Design Commission shall review
all applications for installation of dish antennas under this
Subsection. The Planning and Community Design Commission
shall approve or conditionally approve the application if it finds
that the installation would not be detrimental, inharmonious or
inconsistent with the property in the surrounding area. Such
a finding shall be based on a determination that the position,
color, appearance and overall design of the installation are
compatible with the architectural design of the structure and
harmonious with surrounding properties. The Planning and
Community Design Commission may require that the
installation incorporate reasonable measures to minimize
potential adverse effects on surrounding properties.
D. Where the Planning and Community Design Commission determines
upon the written request of an applicant that compliance at a particular
location with the standards as set forth in Subdivisions (1) through (6)
of Subsection (B) hereof or the standards as set forth in Subsection (C)
hereof will impose unreasonable limitations on or prevent reception of
satellite signals or will impose excessive costs on dish antenna users,
the Planning and Community Design Commission shall have authority
to vary the standards. In exercising this authority, the Planning and
Community Design Commission shall vary the standards only to the
extent necessary to alleviate the limitations imposed at that location
consistent with the aesthetic, health and safety objectives of this
Section. The Planning and Community Design Commission shall further
consider whether the application of any standard at a particular
location results in:
1. Obscuring of the dish antenna line of sight;
2. Prevention of satellite signal reception; or
3. Imposition of excessive costs in light of the purchase and
installation cost of the equipment.
4. No owner of property on which a satellite dish is to be installed
shall initiate the installation or cause any such act without first
obtaining all required building and electrical permits therefor.

D. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of the law, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or

powers of the Building Official.
A. Area Variance. An area variance may issue to permit the building or
enlargement of a structure when specific enforcement of the Zoning
Ordinance would prohibit such construction. The Board of Adjustment
may issue an area variance only upon findings that:
1. The property has a unique condition, one not typically found in the
same zoning district, relating to the width, depth, or shape of the
lot, its topography, or other exceptional circumstance not created
by an owner or the applicant; and
2. Strict application of the Zoning Ordinance would result in practical
difficulties, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, which
would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of the property; and
3. The variance would not unreasonably affect adjacent properties;
and
4. The variance would observe the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance,
secure public safety and welfare, and do substantial justice; and
5. The variance would satisfy the additional criteria of Subsection
400.1650(C), below.
B. Use Variance. A use variance may issue to permit a use of property not
otherwise permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. The Board of Adjustment
may issue a use variance only upon finding that:
1. The property has a unique condition, one not prevalent in the same
zoning district, relating to the width, depth, or shape of the lot, its
topography, or other exceptional circumstance not created by an
owner or the applicant; and
2. Strict application of the Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship which would render the property not
suitable for any use permitted in the Zoning Code for the zoning
district in which the property is located, thus depriving the owner
of all beneficial use of the property; and
3. The appellant has sufficiently demonstrated unnecessary hardship
through actual proof, and not mere conclusory or lay opinion, that
the property has no permitted beneficial use; and
4. The variance would not unreasonably affect adjacent properties,
nor alter the essential character of the locality, nor violate the

City's land use plan, and would observe the spirit of the Zoning
Ordinance, secure public safety and welfare, and do substantial
justice; and
5. The variance would satisfy the additional criteria of Subsection
400.1650(C), below.
C. Additional Variance Criteria. Before issuing any variance, the Board
shall find that the variance will not:
1. Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or
2. Unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or
3. Increase the public danger of fire and safety, or
4. Diminish or impair established property value within the
surrounding area, or
5. In any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort,
morals and welfare of the City of Olivette.
D. Every variance granted or denied by the Board shall be accompanied by
a written finding of fact, based on sworn testimony and evidence, and
conclusions of law specifying the reason for granting or denying such
variance.
A. Any person, any neighborhood organization as defined in Section
32.105, RSMo., representing such person or persons, or any officer,
department, board or bureau of the municipality, or persons jointly or
severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may
present to the Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis, Missouri, a
petition duly verified setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, and specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the Board.
B. Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of
certiorari directed to the Board to review such decision of the Board
and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return thereto must
be made and served upon the relator's attorney, which shall not be less
than ten (10) days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of
the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from but
the court may, on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause
shown, grant a restraining order.
C. The Board shall not be required to return the original papers acted
upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies
thereof or of such portion thereof as may be called for by such writ. The
return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and
material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be

is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take
additional evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may
direct and report the same to the court with his/her findings of fact
and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings
upon which a determination of the court shall be made. The court may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought
up for review.
D. Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless it shall appear to
the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith or with
malice in making the decision appealed from.

5-27-2003]
Section 405.300. Design Standard — Compliance Required. [R.O.
2008 §240.155; Ord. No. 2175, 5-27-2003]
A. The purpose of the design standards for land development is to control
subdivision activity to promote public safety, health and general welfare
of the residents of Olivette. More specifically, these regulations are
specifically designed to:
1. Provide for orderly growth and harmonious development of the City
of Olivette consistent with established policies and land use plans
of the City.
2. Ensure the size, shape and orientation of building lots is designed
to provide desirable building sites logically related to topography,
natural features, streets, parking areas, common ground (if any),
other structures and adjacent land uses. Due regard shall be given
to natural features such as large trees, unusual rock formations,
watercourses and sites with historical significance, scenic views
and similar assets, the preservation of which would add
attractiveness and value to the subdivision.
3. Secure proper arrangement of streets for efficient traffic
circulation through the coordination of existing and planned
streets, Comprehensive Plan, public facilities and adjoining
developed land.
4. Achieve lots of maximum utility and viability laid out and of size in
harmony with existing and proposed development of the area.
5. Secure adequate provisions of water, drainage and sanitary sewer
facilities based upon City, State and Federal requirements.
6. Provide ample and useable open space, recreation areas and other
public facilities and ensure adequate access and linkages are
provided for their use.
A. The subdivision shall comply with all the standards contained in this
Chapter. In addition, the subdivision shall conform to the following:
1. Any approved master development plan or Comprehensive Plan for
the City of Olivette or applicable portions thereof, and
2. The zoning ordinance and building codes of the City of Olivette as

A. The lot arrangement shall be such that in constructing a building
according to the applicable zoning district standards of Chapter 400
and the subdivision standards of this Article, topography or other
natural conditions will not create difficulties in placing the building, in
constructing driveways with reasonable grades and in providing
adequate yard areas. Acute angles created by side lot lines and odd
shape lots shall provide for adequate easements and setbacks.

standards identified in the zoning ordinance.
d. The minimum lot width, as defined by the zoning ordinance,
shall be measured along the setback. In no case shall the
frontage of a lot measured along the right-of-way line be less
than fifty percent (50%) of the minimum lot width.
e. Side lot lines shall generally be perpendicular to street or
right-of-way lines or radial to curved streets.
f. Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where necessary
to provide separation of the subdivision from a highway,
arterial or collector street, shopping center, industrial district,
park, other similar non-residential area or as otherwise
required by topography or similar concerns.
g. Double frontage lots shall provide primary vehicular access
from the internal residential (local) street, unless it is
impractical because of topography or similar concerns.
h. Double frontage lots shall provide a minimum ten (10) foot
wide landscape buffer abutting the property line adjacent to
the secondary street. Said buffer shall consist of a screening to
include, but not limited to, a heavily landscaped earth berm or
a combination of a solid wall or decorative fence and evergreen
planting of equivalent visual density or other effective means
as determined by the Commission.

C. Within blocks more than seven hundred (700) feet in length, the
Commission may require, at or near the middle of the bock, a
pedestrian way connecting adjacent streets or public areas, shopping
centers, etc. Such pedestrian way shall be at least ten (10) feet in width
and shall be dedicated to public use for pedestrian purposes only.
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and proposed
streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be
served by such streets. The following standards shall apply:
1. General standards. These general standards shall apply to
residential and non-residential subdivisions.

residential street, or
(2) Three hundred (300) feet, when the intersected street is a
collector street or highway are prohibited.
l. Street rights-of-way shall not be placed adjacent to side or rear
property lines of a lot or parcel in an established subdivision,
except as is necessary to provide for future connections to
adjoining unsubdivided tracts where deemed appropriate by
the Commission. A minimum twenty (20) foot landscape buffer,
established as common ground, shall be provided between the
street right-of-way and the side or rear property lines of a lot or
parcel in an established subdivision. Intersection roundings
shall be exempt from this requirement.
m. Additional traffic lanes or other widening, pavement thickness,
drainage facilities, granular base, traffic control devices and
other improvements may be required to accommodate
increased traffic volumes projected to be generated by the
subdivision, unsuitable soil conditions, steep grades or other

possible, consistent with proper provision for drainage.
Approaches to intersections shall have a grade not exceeding
Section
405.330
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
405.330
AO:622
three percent (3%) for a distance of not less than one hundred
fifty (150) feet measured from the centerline of the
intersecting street.
o. A tangent of less than one hundred (100) feet in length shall be
avoided between reverse curves on major and collector streets.
p. Any subdivision street platted along an existing street may be
required to provide additional right-of-way, not to exceed
twenty (20) feet on either side.
(1) When a subdivision is located on one (1) side of an existing
street, required right-of-way width shall be provided
measured from the centerline of the right-of-way as
originally established or traveled. The centerline must
meet the requirements of the Director with regard to
radius when located on a curved roadway.
(2) Additional right-of-way beyond twenty (20) feet may be
required by the Commission.
q. Additional right-of-way dedication may be required for future
road construction as determined by the Commission.
r. The Commission may require a street to be dedicated for
public use where deemed in the best interest of the traveling
public to provide circulation.
s. When streets are proposed to remain private, the subdivider
shall be required to have either an indenture or statement on
the record plat establishing the method of providing
continuous maintenance of streets and storm sewers.
t. Any public streets within a subdivision that are located within
the floodplain shall be protected from flood damage as directed
by the Director.
2. Residential standards. In addition to the above, the following shall
apply for residential subdivisions:
a. A minimum radius of twenty (20) feet at street right-of-way
intersection and a minimum radius of thirty-two (32) feet at the
back of the curb or edge of the pavement shall be required.
Greater radii may be required at the right-of-way intersection
and back of curb or edge of pavement with a collector street as
directed by the Director.
b. All stub streets in excess of four hundred fifty (450) feet in
length as measured from the centerline of the street
intersection to the property line on the plat boundary shall be
provided with a temporary cul-de-sac turnaround, with a

the right-of-way, shall have a temporary cul-de-sac turnaround,
with a circular pavement provided in accordance with this
Section.
d. A street on which residential lots front and which parallels, but
is not adjacent to, a railroad right-of-way shall be at a distance
from the railroad right-of-way sufficient to provide lots with a
minimum depth of one hundred sixty (160) feet. As used in this
Section, the term "parallels" refers to the general layout of the
street and not to a specific alignment.
e. A street right-of-way shall not be placed adjacent to any
railroad right-of-way except as is necessary to accommodate an
approved or future railroad crossing. A landscape buffer at
least fifty (50) feet wide, designed as common ground, shall be
provided between the street right-of-way as directed by the
Director.
f. The pavement width set forth for multiple-family access streets
does not allow for parking, nor will parking be permitted on

minimum of eighteen (18) inches below grade. All piping
and wiring to illumination sources shall be contained
within the light standards or pole structure.
(6) All electric lighting shall be controlled automatically by
programmed time devices, photoelectric cells or the like.
Street and residential lighting shall be on from dusk to
dawn.
(7) Light standards shall not be located within three (3) feet of
the street pavement. Where sidewalks are required, street
light standards shall be located between the sidewalk and
street pavement. Variation to this Section may be
approved by the Director.
(8) The subdivider shall submit to the Director a maintenance
agreement, an indenture or other similar instrument
setting forth the person, corporation, trustees or other
agency responsible for the assessment as well as the
collection of the monies necessary for the operation of the
street lighting system within the subdivision.
b. Installation. All street lighting shall be installed and
maintained in accordance with the approved street lighting
plan.
A. Sidewalks. Unless an "alternate subdivision sidewalk plan", as
described below, is approved for a residential subdivision, sidewalks
will be required on both sides of streets within new subdivisions and on
the subdivision side of an adjoining street. For minor residential streets,
minor subdivision streets and cul-de-sac streets serving less than ten
(10) single-family residential lots, including corner lots, the subdivider
may reduce the sidewalk requirement to one (1) side of a new street
within the subdivision. All sidewalks shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with the specifications established by the Director. The
minimum requirements for sidewalks shall be as follows:
1. Residential sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement
having a minimum thickness of four (4) inches and increased to six
(6) inches at driveway entrances. The minimum width of sidewalks
in residential zoning districts shall be four (4) feet.
2. Non-residential sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement
having a minimum thickness of four (4) inches and increased to
Section
405.330
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
405.340
AO:628
seven (7) inches at driveway entrances. The minimum width of
sidewalks in non-residential developments shall be six (6) feet.
3. All sidewalks shall meet requirements of the Federal Americans
with Disabilities Act with regard to handicapped accessibility.
4. Unless otherwise required or permitted by the Commission,
sidewalks shall be placed in the street right-of-way and located no
closer than five (5) feet from the edge of curb and no closer than
one (1) foot from and parallel to the edge of the right-of-way.
5. Where sidewalks do not presently exist along the portion of Olive
Boulevard that is a State highway, a minimum six (6) foot wide
sidewalk shall be provided. However, if MoDOT prohibits such
sidewalk within the State right-of-way, then the sidewalk shall be
placed in a public easement outside of the right-of-way.
6. If a subdivider requests a waiver from the above sidewalk
requirements, the Commission shall determine the feasibility of the
sidewalk construction considering, but not limited to, the following
factors:
a. Interference with existing structures;
b. Existing site grades and roadway grades;
c. Excessive construction costs;
d. Planned structures;
e. Drainage patterns and controls;
f. Federal, State and County regulations;
g. Preservation of significant vegetation;
h. Preservation of natural features, such as large trees, unusual
rock formations, watercourses, historical significance and
similar assets;
i. Conditions peculiar to a site;
j. Public safety and convenience.
If the Commission determines sidewalks are not
feasible, in lieu of the sidewalks, the Commission may
require enhanced features to the subdivision such as
landscaping and water features of approximate or
equal value.
B. Pedestrian Ways. Subdividers may be required to provide pedestrian
ways within subdivisions when the Commission determines that a
pedestrian way is necessary to provide access within a medium to high
density development or to parks, schools, shopping areas, public
Section

AO:629
Section 405.350. Utilities. [R.O. 2008 §240.180; Ord. No. 2175,
5-27-2003]
transportation facilities, mid-block crossings, common ground or other
similar facilities or where otherwise necessary to promote the public
safety. A pedestrian way shall be provided in accordance with the
following:
1. A minimum of ten (10) feet of right-of-way shall be provided for the
required pedestrian way.
2. If a pedestrian way is necessary to provide access to an area
intended for the installation of activity recreation facilities, a
walkway will be required within the pedestrian way. The walkway
shall be constructed with four (4) foot wide and four (4) inch thick
Portland cement pavement or other all-weather surface as
approved by the Director on a grade longitudinally not exceeding
eight percent (8%) unless steps are provided as a part of the
walkway.
3. Planting pockets shall be provided in pedestrian ways for tree and
shrub planting.
4. Fences or other improvements may also be required if the
Commission determines that such improvements are necessary to
protect adjacent properties or pedestrians.
5. No building permit shall be issued on lots abutting the walkway
required within a pedestrian way until the walkway has been
constructed.
C. Alternate Subdivision Sidewalk/Pedestrian Way Plan. It is recognized
that in certain instances, due to topography and other conditions, a
subdivider may wish to propose a pedestrian walkway plan for a
specific residential subdivision that will require a deviation from the
requirements for sidewalks as set forth above (such as a system of
pedestrian ways that would follow rear lot lines or which might border a
natural drainage course). In such instances, an overall plan for the
proposed alternate system of pedestrian ways (an alternate subdivision
sidewalk/pedestrian way plan) shall be submitted along with the
subdivision preliminary subdivision plat and will be reviewed as a part
of the preliminary subdivision plat approval process. An alternate
subdivision sidewalk/pedestrian way plan must provide a continuous
system of walkways located within easements dedicated as pedestrian
ways on the final subdivision plat and complying with the requirements
set forth above or as may be otherwise established by the Commission
for pedestrian ways.
A. Underground Wiring Required. All electric, lighting, telephone and

locations approved by the Director. Switching enclosures, pad-mounted
transformers and service pedestals may also be installed above ground
in locations approved by the Director. The City Council may approve,
upon recommendations from the Commission, above ground
installations in whole or in part for subdivisions, only when a request
is submitted by the subdivider with documentation that supports the
impracticability of installing such utility lines underground.
B. Water Facilities. The subdivider shall secure water and service to each
lot within the subdivision for the purpose of providing sufficient potable
water supply and fire protection. The subdivider shall arrange for
installation of water mains. Fire hydrants shall be located and installed
in accordance with the specifications established by the City of Olivette
Fire Department.
C. Sanitary And Storm Sewers.
1. Adequate sanitary sewer collection lines shall be provided and
accessible to each lot. All sanitary sewers, sanitary sewer
connections, manholes and other sanitary installations serving the
subdivision shall comply with MSD design standards and design
standards established by the Director. In instances where there are
differences between MSD standards and those established by the
Director, the most restrictive standard shall apply. The subdivider
shall be responsible for installing all required building service
connections.
2. Every subdivision shall be designed to control stormwater runoff.
All storm sewers, storm sewer connections, detention/retention
facilities and other storm drainage improvements shall comply with
MSD design standards and design standards established by the
Director. In instances where there are differences between MSD
standards and those established by the Director, the most
restrictive standard shall apply.
3. In residential subdivisions, drainage/retention facilities and land
area required to provide access to such facilities shall be located
within common ground. Drainage detention facilities or other
storm drainage facilities that will not be maintained by MSD shall
be conveyed to the trustees of the subdivision association for
maintenance purposes in accordance with this Chapter.
4. In single lot subdivisions, drainage detention facilities or other
storm drainage facilities that will not be maintained by MSD shall
be maintained by the property owner.
5. Drainage discharge. All drainage provisions shall be of such design
to carry surface waters to the nearest practical storm drain or
natural watercourse as approved by the Director. The finished
grade of sites, one (1) acre or greater in area, from which all or a
portion will drain into a natural or improved drainage way, shall be
so designed so that stormwater runoff is intercepted by diversion

swales or area inlets and lowered to a stable outlet constructed
of concrete, rip-rap, pipe or other techniques required by MSD
or as specified by the Director. The rate of discharge of surface
water runoff shall be in accordance with the requirements of MSD,
except that the Director may require more restrictive discharge
rate in areas where flash flooding, bank erosion or other chronic
stormwater drainage problems exist.
D. Other Utilities. The design and installation of other utilities (e.g.,
electrical distribution, gas mains and services, telephone and cable
television) shall be provided at a service level necessary for the
subdivision and in accordance with the specifications, approval and
inspection requirements of the applicable utility company.
E. All Underground Utilities. All existing trees that are to be preserved
shall be protected from damage by excavation activities. Roots of such
trees shall not be cut without express approval of the Director.
A. General Requirements.
1. In any case in which a subdivider installs or causes the installation
of water, sanitary sewer, electrical power, telephone, cable
television or other facilities outside a public street right-of-way and
intends that such facilities shall be owned, operated and
maintained by a public utility or any entity other than the
subdivider, the subdivider shall transfer such utility or entity the
necessary ownership or easement rights to enable the utility or
entity to operate and maintain such facilities upon their completion
and acceptance by the utility or entity. Such easements shall be
clearly indicated on the final subdivision plat.
2. Where possible, easements should be located along rear and side
lot lines. Such easements shall not be less than ten (10) feet in
width, which may be evenly divided between abutting properties.
B. Storm Drainage Easements.
1. Storm drainage easements may be required for the proper
drainage within and through a subdivision. Wherever a subdivision
is traversed by a watercourse, drainage channel or stream, there
shall be provided a drainage easement which shall be for the
purpose of widening, straightening, improving and maintaining
such drainage way. The width of the drainage easement shall be as
necessary for the access and maintenance of the drainage way or
as required by MSD.
2. Access easements shall be established as necessary to provide an
unobstructed route to the storm drainage easement area for

Section 405.370. Site Grading and Erosion Control. [R.O. 2008
§240.190; Ord. No. 2175, 5-27-2003]
maintenance equipment. Separately designated access easements
shall not be less than twenty (20) feet or as specified by MSD.
A. The minimum standards of grading and erosion control shall be as
follows; however, more stringent standards may be required by the
Director based on site conditions:
1. Site grading.
a. Phasing. Site grading shall be phased, as necessary, so that
each graded area of the construction site has long-term erosion
control measures in place within six (6) months of initiating
grading for each graded area. The required grading and
erosion control plans shall indicate the proposed grading
phasing, either by graphic delineation of phasing on the plan or
on a key map of the site. The grading and erosion control plans
shall provide cut and fill quantities and delineate borrow and
stockpile areas.
b. Site grading and storm drainage control. Lots shall be graded
so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings to be
built thereon. Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Site grading
shall be designed so as to substantially prevent stormwater
drainage from one lot to another.
c. Maximum finish grade slopes. No cut or fill shall be made
which creates an exposed embankment face steeper in slope
than three (3) horizontal units to one (1) vertical unit (3:1). The
embanked end of the fill shall be uniformly compacted and
stable for the proposed conditions. If a steeper slope is
proposed, stability shall be certified by a professional engineer.
d. Retaining walls. Retaining walls shall be required wherever
necessary to prevent the surface of any excavation or fill from
exceeding at any point the maximum allowable slopes as set
forth herein and for the preservation of existing significant
trees. Retaining walls shall be constructed with reinforced
concrete or interlocking masonry units and shall not exceed a
height of five (5) feet measured from the lowest grade and top
of wall. In instances where more than one (1) row of retaining
walls is required, said walls must be separated by a minimum
of five (5) feet.
e. Compaction. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of ninety
percent (90%) compaction as determined by Modified Proctor,
ASTM D-1557, unless a lesser percent is approved by the
Director. Compaction of greater than ninety percent (90%) may
Section
405.360
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.370
AO:633
be required where special conditions dictate (e.g., large
structures). Compaction of fills for buildings or structures shall
be certified by a professional engineer. The requirements of
the Director for the compaction of fills shall include, but shall
not be limited to, the following:
(1) Areas to be graded by cutting or filling shall be rough
graded to within two-tenths of one (1) foot (0.2 feet) of
accepted elevation after allowance has been made for
thickness of topsoil, paved areas and other installations.
(2) The natural ground surface shall be prepared by removing
topsoil and vegetation and by compacting the fill upon a
series of terraces. Hillside or slope fills shall require
plowing or scarification of original ground.
(3) If fill material moisture content is below the requirement
for compacting to maximum practical density, water in
proper amount shall be added. If moisture content is too
great, fill material shall be aerated by blading or other
satisfactory methods to reduce moisture content.
(4) Frozen materials, soft, mucky, friable or easily
compressible materials shall not be incorporated in fills
intended to support buildings, structures, sewers or
conduits or in the embanked ends of fills. After heavy rain,
interrupted work shall not be resumed until moisture
content is satisfactory. Fill material shall not be placed,
spread or rolled while the ground is frozen or thawing.
(5) The maximum thickness of layers of the fill to be
compacted shall not exceed eight (8) inches.
(6) Compaction shall be by tamping, sheep's foot rollers,
multiple wheel pneumatic or other type rollers. Rolling
shall be continuous until the desired maximum density is
obtained.
(7) A grading plan shall be submitted with the grading permit
or improvement construction permit application for
approval by the Director.
(8) Topsoil disturbed by grading and building operations, if
stripped and piled for storage, shall be stored only in an
amount necessary to complete finish grading.
f. Protection of streets, property. No excavation shall be made so
close to the property line to endanger any adjoining public or
private street without supporting and protecting such public or
private street or property from setting, cracking or other
damage.
Section
405.370
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
405.370
AO:634
g. Location of fill. No fill shall be made so as to cause or to allow
the same to be deposited upon or over any adjoining public or
private street, walk, place or way; nor so close to the top of a
bank of a channel as to create the possibility of bank failure
and sliding.
h. Fill materials. Materials for fills shall consist of material
obtained from excavation or banks, borrow pits or other
sources approved by the Director. Materials shall be free of
vegetable matter and deleterious material and shall not
contain large rocks in excess of six (6) inches in diameter.
i. Removal of timber, rubbish, etc. Timber, logs, trees, brush,
vegetable matter and rubbish of any description shall be
removed in graded areas and disposed of so as to leave the
disturbed area with a neat and finished appearance. Tree
stumps, masonry and other obstructions shall be removed to
the following depths:
(1) Paved areas. Two (2) feet below subgrade.
(2) Lawn areas. Two (2) feet below finished grade.
Solid rock, shale or similar materials shall be
removed to a depth of fifteen (15) inches below
subgrade for paved area and two (2) feet below
finish grade for lawn area except where
impractical because of rock outcropping.
j. Protection of trees. Trees which are designated to remain shall
be enclosed with a five (5) foot high temporary construction
fence located at the drip line of the tree. No grading activity or
storage shall take place within the enclosure. Any tree
designated to be saved lost during site grading shall be
replaced in accordance with this Section.
k. Timing of grading operations. Grading shall be accomplished
between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M., Monday through
Friday, unless in case of emergency or extension of hours is
specifically granted by the City Council.
2. Excavations and fill under pavements (on site).
a. All open excavations for installation of any underground
utilities (except the gas utility), communications lines and
similar installations made under existing pavement or areas
proposed to be paved shall be backfilled with granular backfill
material, approved by the Director, thoroughly compacted in
such a manner as to inhibit any settlement of the backfill
material or finished pavement.
Section
405.370
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.370
AO:635
b. The exemption of the gas utility from the granular backfill
requirements of this Section does not exempt that utility from
thorough compaction of its backfill so as to avoid pavement
settlement.
3. Erosion/siltation control. Every subdivision shall make adequate
provisions to minimize and control both short-term and long-term
erosion and siltation in accordance with the requirements of this
Section and any storm drainage control requirements of MSD. The
Director shall establish specific standards to ensure the compliance
with the intent of these erosion and siltation control requirements.
The Director may require modifications or additions to the erosion
control plans should the proposed measures not adequately control
erosion and siltation. If construction activities disturb land or entail
the grading of an area that is five (5) acres or greater, a land
disturbance permit shall be obtained from the State of Missouri
Department of Natural Resources.
a. Temporary erosion/siltation control measures. Temporary
erosion and sediment control measures are intended to retain
siltation within the subdivision site, particularly if construction
is not completed within a single construction season.
Temporary erosion and siltation control measures shall be
maintained until long-term erosion/siltation control measures
are fully established, including such time that vegetative cover
is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion control
on the site. Temporary erosion/siltation control measures shall
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
(1) Graded areas shall be stabilized immediately upon grading
and maintained to prevent or minimize erosion until
permanent stabilization measures are in place. Permissible
erosion control techniques include contour furrowing or
other surface roughening techniques, mulching, sodding
or other techniques approved by the Director.
(2) Sedimentation shall be retained on the site by filtering
runoff. Where grading exceeds twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet in area, the erosion/siltation control plans shall
provide for sediment or debris basins, silt traps or filters,
staked straw bails and/or geotextile fabric or other
measures to remove sediment from runoff waters as
approved by the Director.
(3) Slopes shall be designed to keep the slope length and
gradient to a minimum to minimize stormwater runoff
velocities over graded areas.
(4) Measures shall be taken to accommodate increased runoff
during grading by utilizing diversion berms, ditches and/or
Section
405.370
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
405.370
AO:636
sediment basins designed in accordance with the
standards established by the Director.
(5) Land and improvements, adjoining the construction site,
shall be provided protection from any increase in surface
water, siltation deposits or any other consequences of
erosion. Where it is necessary for the protection of such
property to enter upon such property, consent must be
obtained from the property owner. The subdivider, at the
subdivider's own expense, shall shore up and protect any
and all buildings, walls, fences or other property that are
exposed to any potential damage as a result of grading.
The subdivider shall be responsible for all damage to
public or private property resulting from failure to
properly protect adjoining properties.
(6) Runoff water from existing developed areas (e.g., parking
lots, paved sites, buildings and similar impervious
surfaces) above the area to be graded shall be intercepted
by sufficiently anchored straw bails and/or geotextile
fabric until such time such runoff can be directed to
diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters,
underground outlet systems or other permanent storm
drainage control measures.
b. Long-term erosion/siltation control. The site plan and erosion
control, storm drainage control and landscape plans shall be
designed to minimize erosion potential upon completion of the
subdivision and thereafter. In support of this requirement, the
following design standards and guidelines shall apply:
(1) The finished grading shall provide for sediment basins,
diversion berms, permanent bank stabilization or other
erosion control techniques approved by the Director,
whenever necessary to avoid damage to adjoining
properties, street, sidewalks, storm drainage ways and
storm sewers.
(2) Landscaping shall be provided in the form of seeded or
sodded grass, ground cover, low walls, earth berms, trees
and shrubbery to enhance the function and appearance of
erosion control grading and facilities.
(3) When grading operations are completed or when
suspended for more than thirty (30) days, permanent grass
must be established at sufficient density to provide erosion
control on the site. Between permanent grass seeding
planting periods (March first (1st) to June first (1st) and
August first (1st) to October first (1st)) temporary cover
shall be provided according to the requirements of the
Director.

(4) All finished grades (areas not to be disturbed by future
improvements) in excess of twenty percent (20%) slopes
5:1 shall be mulched and tacked at the rate of one hundred
(100) pounds per one thousand (1,000) square feet when
seeded.
(5) Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions after
finished grading. Unvegetated open channels shall be
designed so that gradients result in velocities of two (2)
feet per second or less. Open channels with velocities
greater than two (2) feet per second and less than five (5)
feet per second shall be established with permanent
vegetation or by use of commercial erosion blankets, riprap
rock lining, concrete or other suitable materials as
approved by the Director. Detention basins, diversion
berms or other appropriate structures approved by the
Director shall be constructed to prevent velocities above
five (5) feet per second.
(6) Development along natural watercourses shall have
residential lot lines, commercial or industrial
improvements, parking areas or driveways set back a
minimum of fifteen (15) feet from the top of the existing
stream bank. The watercourse shall be maintained by the
trustees of the subdivision association, in the case of a
subdivision, or by the property owner, in the case of an
unsubdivided development. Permanent vegetation shall be
left intact where practical. These requirements may be
waived or modified in cases where stream bank erosion
measures and/or improved channel realignments ensure
permanent erosion control. Such waiver shall be at the
discretion of the Director.
(7) All permanent erosion control measures for any lot shall be
fully established before an occupancy permit can be
issued, except that a temporary occupancy permit may be
issued in cases of undue hardship because of unfavorable
ground conditions. In the latter case, temporary erosion
control measures shall remain in place until such time as
approved by the Director.
A. A subdivision landscape plan shall be submitted with the subdivision
improvement plans for review to the Department of Public Services and
prior to submitting the proposed final subdivision plat. The subdivision
landscape plan shall contain types, sizes and locations of all proposed
and existing plantings. The subdivider shall guarantee the installation
of additional landscaping as shown on the approved landscaping plan in

from the back of the curb.
c. Plant material shall be of species compatible with the climate
and soil factors within the City of Olivette. A list indicating
acceptable plant material is available from the Department of
Public Services.
d. The subdivider shall maintain and warrant all street trees for a
period of three (3) years. In the event that any existing or new
street tree enters a state of shock, shows poor health or dies,
the subdivider will have thirty (30) days from the date of
notification from the Director to replace the street tree in
conformance with this Section.
2. Planting screening. Within areas defined on the subdivision
improvement plans for screen planting or buffer, a continuous
planting of evergreens and deciduous trees shall be provided
consisting of a minimum of one (1) two and one-half (2½) inch
caliper deciduous tree, two (2) two and one-half (2½) inch caliper
flowering trees and eight (8), six (6) to eight (8) foot tall evergreens
for each one hundred (100) feet of such screen.
3. Non-residential subdivisions. Planting in non-residential
subdivisions shall be done in accordance with the requirements of
the Commission as determined in each case.
4. Total tree density requirement for residential subdivisions.

The City Council may require that, in addition to insertion of
covenants or provisions creating easements and provisions for
mandatory membership in the subdivision association in all
deeds to home buyers, the subdivider shall grant an easement
over all common ground to the City to insure that the area will
remain open in perpetuity. Such an easement is intended to
preclude development and preserve common ground and may
provide (at the option of the subdivider) for public access to, or
use of, common ground.
If a subdivision plan includes construction of a landscaped
decorative entryway, islands, statuary or other aesthetically
oriented theme or identity amenities which are to be located
within a dedicated public right-of-way, the subdivision
association shall be specifically charged with the responsibility
for perpetual maintenance of such areas. This shall not apply
to landscaping within the median strip of arterial or major
collector streets where City maintenance is provided.
In the event that a subdivision association established to own
or maintain common ground or any successor association, shall
at any time after development of a residential subdivision,
fail to maintain the common ground in reasonable order and
condition, the City Council may serve written notice upon such
subdivision association setting forth the manner in which the
subdivision association has failed to maintain the common
ground and said notice shall include a demand that such
deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within thirty (30)
days thereof and shall state the date and place of a public
hearing thereon which shall be held following fifteen (15) days
of said notice. At such public hearing, the City Council may
modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies
and may give an extension of time within which they shall be
corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or
in the modification thereof are not corrected within said thirty
(30) days or any extension thereof, the City Council, in order to
preserve the taxable values of properties within the residential
subdivision and to prevent the common ground from becoming
a public nuisance, may authorize appropriate City employees
to enter upon said common ground and maintain the same for
a period of one (1) year. Said entry and maintenance shall not
vest in the public any rights to use the common ground.

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and Purposes
Section 410.010. Statutory Authorization. [Ord. No. 254190 §1,
1-13-2015]
The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section RSMo., 89.020,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Olivette, Missouri ordains
as follows.
Section 410.020. Findings of Fact. [Ord. No. 2541 §1, 1-13-2015]
A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of the City of Olivette, Missouri, are subject to inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of
the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
B. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
1. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
2. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods,
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the
depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one
year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS,
and illustrative materials for St. Louis County, dated February 4,
2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
90.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former Ch. 410, Floodplain Management,
adopted and amended R.O. 2008 §§80.010 — 80.130, 80.150 — 80.270; and 3-8-2005 by
Ord. No. 2273.

410.020
AO:659
Section 410.030. Statement of Purpose. [Ord. No. 2541 §1,
1-13-2015]
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section

elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A Zones is
subject to all provisions of this Chapter. If Flood Insurance Study data is
not available, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from
Federal, State, or other sources.
C. Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted
within any numbered A Zone or AE Zone on the FIRM, unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one (1) foot at any point within the community.
D. All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements,
prefabricated structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other
developments shall require:
1. Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

2. Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base
flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator
as set forth in Section 410.130(B). [NOTE: The FEMA, Region VII
office recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation to qualify for flood insurance rates based upon
floodproofing.]
3. Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements
that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other
than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
a. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and
numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM shall be
required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize
flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.

within unnumbered or numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the
community's FIRM on sites 1) outside of manufactured home park or
subdivision; 2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 3) in
an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base
flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
C. Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the
community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of Section
410.170(B) of this Chapter, be elevated so that either:
1. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot above
the base flood level; or

foot above the base flood elevation to accommodate floodway
conditions when the floodplain is fully developed.]
A. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section
410.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry
debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based
on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway
must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one
(1) foot at any point.
2. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, and other
development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in

and bridges.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
provisions of Subsections (B) through (F) below have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of
historic places upon determination, provided that the proposed activity
will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or

for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and
2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of
all variance actions as required by this Chapter.
A. Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided
individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions
as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Section 410.230 and
Section 410.240 of this Chapter.
B. In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood
and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall
be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
1. Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and
limited storage purposes in flood-prone areas only.
2. For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the

this Chapter.
3. The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in
accordance with Section 410.150(D)(1) of this Chapter. All of the
building's structural components must be capable of resisting
specific flood-related forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
4. Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above highest adjacent grade or floodproofed so that it is
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is
capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance
with Section 410.150(D)(4) of this Chapter.
5. The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that
enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the one-hundred-year

No. 2370 §1, 5-13-2008]
A. Findings. Whereas, the City Council of Olivette finds that buffers
adjacent to streams provide numerous benefits including:
1. Protecting, restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and
biological integrity of streams and their water resources;
2. Removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater;
3. Reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation;
4. Protecting and stabilizing stream banks;
5. Providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff;
6. Maintaining base flow of streams;
7. Contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for
the aquatic ecosystem;
8. Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable
aquatic habitat;
9. Providing riparian wildlife habitat;
10. Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity; and
11. Providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of
greenspace.
B. Purposes. The purpose of this Chapter is to protect the public health,
safety, environment and general welfare; to minimize public and private
losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain
stream water quality by provisions designed to:
1. Create buffer zones along the streams of Olivette for the protection
of water resources; and
2. Minimize land development within such buffers by establishing
buffer zone requirements and by requiring authorization for any
such activities.

Section 420.060. Land Development Requirements. [R.O. 2008
§243.300; Ord. No. 2370 §1, 5-13-2008]
A. Buffer And Setback Requirements. All land development activity
subject to this Chapter shall meet the following requirements:
1. For streams depicted as a solid blue line on the U.S.G.S. map, an
undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty
(50) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of
the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. For all
other streams subject to this Chapter, an undisturbed natural
vegetative buffer shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet,
measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream
as measured from the top of the stream bank.
2. An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet,
measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative
buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading,
filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
3. No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within
the buffer or the setback.
B. Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback
requirements may be granted in accordance with the following
provisions:
1. Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this
Chapter and its shape, topography or other existing physical
condition prevents land development consistent with this Chapter
and the Public Services Department finds and determines that the
requirements of this Chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of
the property by the owner, the Board of Adjustment of Olivette may
grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements
hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to
offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
2. Except as provided above, the Board of Adjustment of Olivette shall
grant no variance from any provision of this Chapter without first
conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and
authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of
the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall give public
notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation within Olivette. The Board of Adjustment shall require
that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed
variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and
posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible
from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Section
420.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
420.060

Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a. When a property's shape, topography or other physical
conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this Chapter
prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b. Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal
buffer requirements in the Chapter would create an extreme
hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following
adoption of this Chapter, actions of any property owner
of a given property have created conditions of a
hardship on that property.
3. At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following
information:
a. A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands,
floodplain boundaries and other natural features as
determined by field survey;
b. A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils,
vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;

proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of
all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and
outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to
be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d. Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be
maintained;
e. At least one (1) alternative plan, which does not include a
buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a
site plan is not possible;
f. A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed
intrusion;
g. A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
h. Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is
proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none
is being proposed.
4. The following factors will be considered in determining whether to
issue a variance:
a. The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other
physical characteristics of the property;

Short Title, Intent And Purpose
Section 422.010. Short Title. [Ord. No. 2601, 2-28-201791]
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The Stormwater
Management Ordinance of the City of Olivette, Missouri."
Section 422.020. Intent And Purpose. [Ord. No. 2601, 2-28-2017]
A. This Chapter is intended to be utilized in conjunction with the Zoning
Ordinance, Subdivision Code, Stream Buffer Protection Ordinance and
Rights-of-Way Usage and Grading Ordinance of the City of Olivette,
Missouri, to ensure that the development of land in the City of Olivette
occurs in a manner that protects, provides for and promotes the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare of the
residents of Olivette.
B. The Clean Water Act Phase II Stormwater Regulations were
promulgated to provide appropriate stormwater management of nonpoint
source pollution in urbanized areas, and these regulations apply
to the watersheds located within the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer
District (MSD). Olivette recognizes that as an urban mature community
which has traditionally been developed to facilitate stormwater
drainage onto streets, catch basins, detention areas and streams, the
City must be cognizant of the quality of water that is being generated
and directed into surrounding watersheds. The intent of this Chapter is
to establish the regulations and guidelines for how stormwater is
managed, purified and detained on private and public property.
C. Specific purposes of this Chapter include the following:
1. To control and manage stormwater on developed property;
2. Minimize adverse stormwater effects on adjoining and nearby
properties;
3. Improve the water quality and limit the sources of impairment
within adjacent streams, basins and watersheds;
4. Commit the City of Olivette to the St. Louis County Phase II
Stormwater Management Plan;
5. To ensure the orderly development of land; and
6. To protect and to conserve the value of building and other
improvements and to minimize adverse impact of development on
adjoining or nearby properties.
91.Editor's Note: Former Chapter 422, Stormwater Management, containing Sections
422.010 through 422.080 was repealed 2-28-2017 by Ord. No. 2601.

A. Purpose And Objective. The City of Olivette recognizes that
redevelopment of property, either in the form of expansion or new
construction, in a developed community is unique and challenging as it
relates to managing stormwater. Given that redevelopment in Olivette,
whether residential or non-residential, occurs on a lot by lot basis,
addressing stormwater issues that go beyond the scope of the property
being developed is limited.
Section
422.050
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
422.060
AO:752
In an effort to adequately plan for and resolve stormwater issues on
a City-wide basis as individual lots redevelop, the adoption of the
following underlying principles are intended to provide the City
guidance during the review of site alterations. These principles will be
applied so as to manage stormwater on two (2) levels:
a. The stormwater impacting the property under review from
adjacent and surrounding properties, and
b. The impacts of the stormwater generated by the existing and
proposed improvements on the property grounds under review
onto adjacent and surrounding properties.
These principles and acceptable practices will be utilized by the City
to manage stormwater generated on a site due to new construction
or reconstruction and to minimize the adverse impact of any increase
of stormwater onto adjacent and surrounding properties. These
principles and acceptable practices are to manage stormwater and
should not be construed as a means for reducing or eliminating
stormwater that is already generated on or surrounding the site.
B. Principles.
1. Applications for site alterations approvals shall be designed and
reviewed in accordance to the following acceptable principles:
a. Encourage the reduction of:
(1) Disturbance to preserved greenspace, buffers, zoning
setbacks, and sensitive areas such as flood plains and
stream buffers;
(2) Impervious surface areas such as rooftops, parking lots,
sidewalks, roads, etc.;
(3) Stormwater generation and the amount of stormwater
leaving the site;
(4) The impact to environmentally sensitive areas; and
b. Minimize:
(1) Erosion of site soils;
(2) Stream bank erosion;
(3) Downstream flooding.
c. Promote the use of pervious surface materials, such as
permeable paver blocks, porous asphalt, porous concrete and
green roofs.
d. Encourage the stormwater generated on the site grounds to
filter, disperse and permeate on the site grounds through the
Section
422.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
422.060
AO:753
use of overland flow to vegetated buffers and other "green"
infrastructure techniques that promote infiltration.
e. Avoid the direct flow of stormwater generated from impervious
surface areas to the storm sewer system.
f. Encourage the installation of engineered systems that treat
stormwater runoff and/or reduce peak stormwater runoff rates
using techniques that employ vegetation and infiltration.
g. Adequately treat stormwater before discharge.
h. Stormwater controls shall be maintainable and enforceable.
2. Acceptable Practices. To promote the adopted principles, the City
of Olivette has adopted the following two (2) documents developed
by the MSD as reference resources for acceptable practices and
tools to manage stormwater, as may be revised from time to time:
a. Site Guidance Design. Tools for incorporating postconstruction
stormwater quality protection into concept plans
and land disturbance permitting. Revision 1, April 17, 2009.
b. Landscape Guide For Stormwater BMPs Design.
Copies of the adopted documents are on file in the office of the Director
of Public Services. In addition to the adopted documents, the
Commission may accept the utilization of other BMPs if the applicant
can satisfactorily show the Commission, and that the Commission
determines, that said practice will equally facilitate the principles and
practices outlined in Section 422.060.

Management Plan is intended to ensure the adequate review and
consideration of potential stormwater management impacts of
proposed site alterations upon the surrounding uses, activities,
properties, the existing stormwater infrastructure, and the watershed,
and that the site alterations adhere to the principles and acceptable
practices outlined in Section 422.060.
1. The Concept Stormwater Management Plan shall illustrate how the
proposed site alternations will:
a. Preserve and/or protect existing natural resources areas that
facilitate pollutant removal and reduce runoff.
b. Limit disturbance and preserve existing pervious surface areas
and sensitive areas such as flood plains and stream buffers.
c. Reduce the amount of impervious surface area. (i.e., rooftops,
parking lots, sidewalks, roads, etc.)
d. Disconnect the stormwater flow generated from impervious
surface areas from the MSD built stormwater infrastructure
system and utilize overland flow to vegetated buffers and other
"green" infrastructure techniques that promote infiltration.
e. Use pervious surface materials, such as permeable paver
blocks, porous asphalt, porous concrete and green roofs.
f. Install engineered systems that treat stormwater runoff and/or
reduce peak stormwater runoff rates using techniques that
employ vegetation and infiltration.
B. Submission Requirements. Submission requirements for the Concept
Stormwater Management Plan shall be in accordance with the
standards identified in Section 400.1080.
1. The Concept Stormwater Management Plan may be incorporated
into other documents identified in Section 400.1080, if in the
opinion of the Director of Public Services, there will be sufficient
detail provided.

A. The intent of this Article is to ensure:
1. The placement and orientation of all buildings along the Olive
Boulevard corridor to enhance the streetscape and aesthetics of
the Olive Boulevard corridor consistent with the City's goals and
objectives as outlined in the Olivette Strategic Plan;

building entrance;
3. Coordinate traffic management and access from the public right-ofway
to developments, as well as between parcels and
developments;
4. Minimal impact on surrounding and abutting residential
properties; and
5. Redevelopments provide a uniform and coordinated off-road cross
access trail for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicular movement
that is separate and independent from the Olive Boulevard
streetscape.
B. The purpose for proper Site Planning is to:
1. Strengthen and reinforce the Olive Boulevard corridor and the
streetscape as proposed under this Chapter.
2. Provide for and accommodate safe and efficient pedestrian
movement between the street, building, neighboring buildings, and
adjacent structures;
3. Minimize the visibility of surface parking dominating the view of a
parcel from the street;
4. Minimize the spillover effects of noise, vehicles, and lighting, to
surrounding residential neighborhoods; and
5. Establish acceptable standards for transitions between nonresidential
properties abutting residential properties.

foster quality architectural design and building material use to
encourage aesthetically pleasing buildings which will protect and
preserve the appearance, character, general health, safety and welfare
of the City. Specifically, these regulations are intended to heighten the
design of architecture in the City and to preserve the value of
properties located along the Olive Boulevard Corridor. These standards
are considered reasonable basic standards, providing sufficient
flexibility to encourage creativity and are not intended to limit the
ingenuity of the design professional. The Council of the City makes the
following determinations and findings with regards to the requirements
below:
1. The materials selected for use by the City represent the character
and quality of architecture of the City;
2. The building design standards are those the City believes best
reflect the architectural values of the community, preserve and
enhance the existing surrounding environment, preserve the value
of properties located along the Olive Boulevard Corridor and
advance the principles and goals of the Olivette Strategic Plan; and
3. Ensure that accessory structures, mechanical equipment, and
other supportive structures intended for a building, multiple
buildings, or site maintenance are not an afterthought, but
properly designed to support and enhance the aesthetics of the
building structures, enhance the site grounds, and complement the
overall surroundings of the site and neighboring properties.

C. Variations.
1. Upon written request from an applicant, the Commission may
forward a recommendation to the City Council to modify or
consider alternative building materials or exterior building
material finish requirements under this Article so long as the
alternative design reinforces the spirit and intent of this Article,
Chapter, and the visions outlined in the Strategic Plan.
2. Standards For Consideration. In exercising this authority, the
Commission shall vary requirements only to the extent necessary,
may not exceed a variation of more than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the required exterior finish, and is subject to the following
standards:
a. The material is recognized as by a professional organization or
agency in the form of an award for its innovative use,
durability, or environmental responsiveness.
b. Can be mediated with an extensive use of another primary
building material.
c. Can be verified to be equivalent in quality or better than the
primary building materials.
A. The intent of this Section is to establish provisions to promote the
highest quality of design consistent with the Olivette Strategic Plan and
standards of the City of Olivette.
B. It is the purpose of this Section is to establish design parameters to
ensure buildings along the Olive Boulevard Corridor are respectful,
complementary, and avoid the overshadow existing developments in the
immediate area. This Section is not intended to place limitations on a
Section
428.430
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
428.440
AO:811
building's size, mass, or height, in comparison to its surroundings,
but to ensure that the building design incorporates forms, scales, and
proportions that may pre-exist.
C. To evaluate building design, the following components will be
considered during review:
1. Building entry.
2. Masses and voids.
3. Elevation articulation.
4. Roof design.
5. Signage.
6. Screening of equipment.
D. Building Entry. All buildings shall have a clearly defined building
entrance that is at a scale convenient and comfortable to the
pedestrian, visible to the pedestrian along the street, and easily
accessible to the pedestrian on the street and within the parking lot.
1. The following design principles shall be used to evaluate
appropriate building entries.
a. Single-story buildings should contain a building entry projects
which projects above the main roofline.
b. All building entries shall provide pedestrian cover from outside
elements.
2. The following figures provide illustrations of building entries that
are found to be acceptable.

E. Masses And Voids. All buildings shall provide differentiated building
planes along each elevation. Each building elevation should contain
variations of mass to voids in a coordinated rhythm. Acceptable
variations include fluctuations in the building plane on each elevation
which incorporate architectural elements such as building projections,
material changes, windows, canopies, arcades, eaves, and other
decorative features that enhance the building's appearance. A flat
unarticulated wall with just windows and doors serving as voids is
unacceptable.
1. The following design principles shall be used to evaluate
appropriate variations in the building plane.
a. In no case shall a plane on any building elevation contain an
unarticulated wall or flat building plane in excess of twentyfive
(25) feet in length without an acceptable interruption in
the building plane. Acceptable interruptions in a building plane
can include a covered pedestrian entry, a canopy, or an arcade
that is ten (10) feet in depth, or pilasters, piers, or building
projections no less than three (3) feet in depth.
b. Heights of structures should relate to adjacent open spaces to
allow maximum sun and ventilation, protection from prevailing
winds, enhance public views of surroundings and minimize
obstruction of view from adjoining structures.
c. Height and scale of new development should recognize the
mass and scale of surrounding developments by providing
architectural elements that provide for a "transition" from the
height of adjacent development to the maximum height of the
proposed structure.
d. To reduce the appearance of large scale, bulky structures,
large buildings which give the appearance of "box-like"
structures should:
(1) Vary the planes of the exterior walls in depth and/or
direction. Wall planes should not run in one (1) continuous
Section
428.440
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
428.440
AO:814
direction for more than twenty-five (25) feet without an
offset;
(2) Vary the height of the building so that it appears to be
divided into distinct massing elements;
(3) Articulate the different parts of a building's facade by use
of color, arrangement of facade elements, or a change in
materials;
(4) Use landscaping and architectural detailing at the ground
level to lessen the impact of an otherwise bulky building;
and
(5) All structure elevations should be architecturally treated.
e. Scale, for purposes here, is the relationship between the size of
the new structure and the size of adjoining permanent
structures. It is also how the proposed building's size relates to
the size of a human being (human scale). Large scale building
elements will appear imposing if they are situated in a visual
environment which is predominantly smaller in scale.
(1) Building scale can be reduced through the proper use of
window patterns, structural bays, roof overhangs, siding,
awnings, moldings, fixtures, and other details.
(2) The scale of buildings should be carefully related to
adjacent pedestrian areas (i.e., plazas, courtyards) and
other structures.
(3) Large dominating structures should be broken up by:
(a) Creating horizontal emphasis through the use of trim;
(b) Adding awnings, eaves, windows, or other
architectural ornamentation;
(c) Use of combinations of exterior materials and
comparable colors; and
(d) Landscape materials.

Section 428.520. Definitions. [Ord. No. 2470 §1, 3-27-2012]
The following definitions shall be applicable to this Article.
BRUSH — A growth or thicket of densely growing small trees and shrubs.
CALIPER — For the purposes of this Chapter, a caliper is the diameter of
a tree trunk, measured in inches, at a point at least six (6) inches above
ground level.
CANOPY — The overall area of a tree's foliage, the outer edge of which is
the drip line.
CONIFEROUS TREE — Any of various mostly needle-leaved or scale-leaved,
chiefly evergreen, cone-bearing gymnospermous trees or shrubs such as
pines, spruces, and firs. In botany and horticulture, a coniferous tree or
plant are those where green foliage is persistent year-round.
DECIDUOUS TREE — In botany and horticulture, a deciduous tree or plant
are those that lose all their leaves for part of the year.
DECIDUOUS TREE, LARGE — A tree with a canopy that reaches at least
one thousand six hundred (1,600) square feet at maturity under urban
conditions, with crown diameter of at least forty-five (45) feet. Large trees
are primarily sought after for the shade qualities they possess. Large
landscape trees can become the focal point in a large landscape area and
they can dominate the view.
DECIDUOUS TREE, MEDIUM — A tree with a canopy that reaches at least
nine hundred (900) square feet at maturity but less than one thousand six
hundred (1,600) square feet under urban conditions, with a crown diameter
of at least thirty-five (35) feet.
Section
428.510
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
428.520
AO:827
DECIDUOUS TREE, SMALL — A tree with a canopy that reaches at least
four hundred (400) square feet at maturity but less than nine hundred
(900) square feet under urban conditions, with a crown diameter of at
least twenty-five (25) feet. Commonly identified as ornamental trees, small
deciduous trees fit many applications and planting sites.
GYNMOSPERMOUS TREES — A plant, such as a cycad or conifer, whose
seeds are not enclosed within an ovary.
ORNAMENTAL TREE — Ornamental trees are usually described as trees
that are less than twenty-five (25) feet tall. They usually have a defining
feature such as flowers, unique foliage, notable bark, or a form of branching
that is eye catching. Many ornamental trees are flowering and the time of
flowering, mainly early spring, will draw attention to the landscape.
PLANTING UNITS — A term used to express a numeric value assigned to
plantings identified in this Chapter.
SHRUB — A woody plant smaller than a tree, usually having multiple
permanent stems branching from or near the ground.
UPRIGHT EVERGREEN — A coniferous tree.
Section 428.530. Landscape Standards and Maintenance. [Ord. No.
2470 §1, 3-27-2012]
A. Standards. The following standards shall be considered the minimum

including elements designed to give light output control, such as a reflector
(mirror) or refractor (lens), the ballast, housing and attachment parts.
FOOT-CANDLE — A unit of illuminance amounting to one (1) lumen per
square foot.
FULL-CUTOFF — A light fixture which cuts off all upward transmission of
light.
FULLY SHIELDED — A fully shielded luminaire is a luminaire constructed
or shielded in such a manner that all light emitted by the luminaire, either
directly from the lamp or indirectly from the luminaire, is projected below
the horizontal plane through the luminaire's lowest light emitting part as
determined by photometric test or certified by the manufacturer.
GLARE — The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that
is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted
or which causes annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual performance and
visibility.
HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE (HID) LIGHTING — A family of bulb type
including mercury vapor, metal halide, high pressure and low pressure
sodium which glow when an electric current is passed through a gas
mixture inside the bulb.
HORIZONTAL (OR VERTICAL) FOOT-CANDLES — The amount of light
striking a vertical or horizontal plane.
ILLUMINANCE — The quantity of light or luminous flux arriving at a
surface divided by the area of the illuminated surface, measured in lux or
foot-candles.

Section 430.020. Finding and Determination of Blight. [R.O. 2008
§55.201; Ord. No. 2240, 7-27-2004]
A. It is hereby found, determined and declared by the Council of the City
of Olivette, Missouri, as follows:
1. There exist in isolated portions of the City certain areas, lots and
structures that, by reason of age, obsolescence, inadequate or
outmoded design, physical deterioration, substandard or
unsanitary improvements, excessive or unproductive land
coverage, defective design or arrangement of buildings, lack of
proper support facilities or lack of appropriate light, air, open
space, have become economic and social liabilities conducive to ill
health, transmission of disease, crime or inability to pay reasonable
taxes;
2. The existence of such areas, lots and structures and the failure to
clear, replan, rehabilitate, reconstruct or redevelop these areas,
lots and structures results in progressive deterioration, causes a
wasteful expenditure of public funds for policing and occasions
large outlays for the creation and maintenance of public facilities
and services;
3. Such areas, lots and structures have impaired the economic value
of neighborhoods, infecting them with blight characterized by
depreciated values, impaired investment, reduced income and
consequential inability to pay reasonable taxes and such conditions
constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the
citizens of the City;
4. Such areas, lots and structures require the employment of capital
on an investment basis and the redevelopment of such areas, lots
and structures under proper supervision with appropriate planning
as to land use, traffic circulation and construction;
5. The clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction and
redevelopment of such areas, lots and structures on a substantial
scale is necessary for the removal of blight and for the public
welfare; and
6. It is in the public interest to encourage the removal of blight and to
provide procedures for its removal as allowed by Chapter 353,
RSMo., and as provided herein.

plan as amended, modified or changed by ordinance.
B. Investigation. After a development plan has been authorized by the City
Council, the City shall investigate and determine from time to time

Section 430.240. Authority and Limitations. [R.O. 2008 §55.410;
Ord. No. 2334, 2-13-2007]
A. This Article codifies and supplements the condemnation limitations and
procedures imposed by Chapter 523, RSMo., on local governments,
including the City of Olivette, for the purposes of making those
provisions readily available to the residents and businesses of the City,
increasing public awareness of the authority of the City to condemn
private property for public use through eminent domain, establishing
City Council considerations for the exercise of eminent domain and
reforming the process and use of eminent domain in the City.
B. If any provision of this Article conflicts with any provision of Chapter
523, RSMo., or any other applicable law as they may be amended from
time to time, the statutory provision shall supersede this Article.
A. The power of eminent domain shall be exercised only in the City's name
and as allowed by law and only by the City Council or those agencies:
1. Which are authorized by the Constitution or Statutes of Missouri to
condemn private property; and
2. The members of which are appointed by the City Council.
B. Private property shall not be condemned through the process of
eminent domain for solely economic development purposes.
1. For the purpose of this Article, "economic development" shall mean
the use of a specific piece of property or properties to provide an
increase in the tax base, tax revenues, employment and general
economic health of the City, but the term "economic development"
shall not be construed to include the elimination of blighted,
substandard or unsanitary areas when authorized by laws passed
pursuant to Article VI, Section 21 of the Missouri Constitution.
2. For the purposes of this Article, unless otherwise provided by law,
the following terms shall have the following meanings:
BLIGHTED AREA — An area which, by reason of the predominance
of defective or inadequate street layout, unsanitary or unsafe
conditions, deterioration of site improvements, improper
subdivision or obsolete platting or the existence of conditions
which endanger life or property by fire and other causes or any
combination of such factors, retards the provision of housing
accommodations or constitutes an economic or social liability or a
Section
430.230
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
430.240
AO:871
menace to the public health, safety, morals or welfare in its present
condition and use.
SUBSTANDARD AREA — Any improved area within the boundaries
of a redevelopment area located within the territorial limits of
the City in which fifty percent (50%) or more of the structures
in the area have an age of thirty-five (35) years or more and
which is detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or welfare
and meets at least three (3) of the following factors: dilapidation,
obsolescence, deterioration, illegal use of individual structures,
presence of structures below minimum code standards,
abandonment, excessive vacancies, overcrowding of structures and
community facilities, inadequate utilities, excessive land coverage,
deleterious land use or layout, depreciation of physical
maintenance, lack of community planning or lack of ventilation,
light or sanitary facilities.
UNSANITARY AREA — An area in which there is a predominance
of buildings and improvements which, by reason of dilapidation,
deterioration, age or obsolescence, inadequate provision for
ventilation, light, air sanitation or open spaces, high density of
population and overcrowding of buildings, overcrowding of land
or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property
by fire and other causes or any combination of such factors, is
conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality,
juvenile delinquency and crime or constitutes an economic or social
liability and is detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or
welfare.
3. Blighted, substandard or unsanitary areas as so defined are, when
permitted by context, hereafter collectively referred to as "blight"
or "blighted".
C. Blighted Areas.
1. If the exercise of the City's eminent domain authority is based on a
determination that a defined area is blighted, the Council shall
individually consider each parcel of property in the defined area
with regard to whether the property meets the relevant statutory
definition. If the Council finds that a preponderance of the defined
redevelopment area is blighted, the Council may proceed with
condemnation of any parcels included in such area.
2. Any determination that an area is blighted shall not be arbitrary or
capricious or induced by fraud, collusion or bad faith and shall be
supported by substantial and competent evidence which shall
include a blighting analysis prepared by an independent,
disinterested, licensed land use planner or other similar
professional experienced in making such analyses, to be retained
by the City.

Section 430.250. Council Considerations. [R.O. 2008 §55.420; Ord.
No. 2334, 2-13-2007]
3. The City or the affected property owner may seek a determination
as to whether the standards of blight have been met as provided by
relevant Missouri law, by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County in
any condemnation action filed to acquire the owner's property or in
an action seeking a declaratory judgment as allowed by Missouri
law.
4. No action to acquire property by eminent domain within a
redevelopment area shall be commenced later than three (3) years
from the date of the determination, by ordinance, that the property
is blighted; however, such determination may be renewed for
successive three (3) year periods by the City Council.
A. The Council recognizes that requests for and the use of eminent domain
will depend on the unique circumstances of each particular
development being proposed. While eminent domain can only be
considered and exercised or denied on a case-by-case basis, it should be
granted only when all fair and reasonable efforts to negotiate the
purchase of real estate have failed. To assist in the determination of
whether and how to use eminent domain, the Council shall consider the
following non-exclusive factors as may be applicable:
1. Whether a redevelopment proposal has been adequately disclosed
to the public and whether adequate notice has been made to the
property owners subject to the proposal, property owners
neighboring the proposal and any other interested party.
2. Whether such interested parties and the public have had the
opportunity to be fully informed of and to be heard on the
redevelopment proposal and the request to exercise eminent
domain.
3. Whether the applicant's redevelopment proposal is consistent with
the planning principles and goals of the Olivette Strategic
Comprehensive Plan—Dynamic Sense of Place as may be amended
from time to time.
4. Whether the applicant's proposal has been determined to be viable
and desirable in conjunction with the City's redevelopment project
management process as established in the Olivette Strategic
Comprehensive Plan—Dynamic Sense of Place and as may be
amended from time to time and whether the applicant has followed
that process.
5. Whether the applicant has demonstrated a firm and documented
financial commitment to the redevelopment proposal, including a
financing commitment to complete the project as proposed.
Section
430.240
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
430.250
AO:873
6. Whether the applicant has made a reasonable, good faith effort to
acquire the property needed for the applicant's proposal before
requesting the Council's approval of the exercise of eminent
domain, including:
a. The use of reputable, disinterested, certified appraisers, with
demonstrated competence in the valuation of the kind of
property at issue, in preparing purchase options or offers;
b. Communicating openly and honestly with interested parties;
c. Making purchase offers that reflect just compensation for the
property to be acquired, including enhanced values as
provided in Section 430.310 hereof;
d. Making purchase offers, to the extent reasonably possible, that
would allow the property owner to purchase comparable
property, with comparability being assessed in terms of the
school district, physical characteristics, location or such other
factors germane to the property being acquired; and
e. Keeping purchase offers open for a reasonable time for the
property owner's consideration.
7. Whether the applicant has obtained control over any parcels of the
property needed for the proposal, the percentage of such control
and, if so, whether the extent of such control tends to demonstrate
the preferences of the property owners immediately affected by the
proposal as to the desirability and propriety for using eminent
domain.
8. Whether there is any other reasonable alternative to the exercise of
eminent domain.
9. Whether the authority for the exercise of eminent domain should

registered persons and their point(s) of contact.
E. Termination Of Registration.
1. The City shall have the right to terminate a registration for a
substantial and ongoing failure to comply with this code or other
applicable law or for defrauding or attempting to defraud the City.
To invoke the provisions of this Section, the Director shall give the
person written notice of such intent. If within thirty (30) calendar
days following such written notice from the City, the person has not

whether to terminate the registration based on the information
presented at the hearing and other information of record. If the
Director determines to terminate a registration, the decision shall
be in writing setting forth the reasons therefor. The Director may
make such decision conditional on a person's failure to resolve
outstanding problems or take appropriate steps to resolve such
problems within a specific period of time. A copy of such decision
shall be provided to the person.

A. Application Requirements.
1. Any person desiring to perform ROW work must first apply for and
obtain a ROW permit, in addition to any other building permit,
license, easement, franchise, or authorization that may be required
by law. In the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the person
conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify the City of
the location of the work and shall apply for the required ROW

several different locations or throughout the City.
2. No person desiring to become a person having facilities within the
ROW, and no person having facilities within the ROW, who has

with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are
determined;
e. If the applicant is, or is acting on behalf of, a person having
facilities within the ROW or a person desiring to become a
person having facilities within the ROW, verification that the
applicant or such person has registered with the City and that
the information included in that registration is accurate as of
the date of the application;

(f) Such other information as may be reasonably required
by the Director and consistent with Section 520.040
hereof;
(2) Certification, by a duly authorized representative of any
person owning a facility, utility pole or other structure

(b) The person is not in default of any franchise, license or
other agreement with the City; and

authorized thereby to regulate same through this Code. In the
absence of such proof, the ROW user shall provide for the
assumption of all risk and the indemnification of the City for
any resulting loss or damage, in a form acceptable to the City
Attorney.
4. The information required by the application may be submitted in
the form maintained by the applicant, provided it is responsive to
the application's requirements, and the applicant shall be allowed a
reasonable amount of time to complete the application based on
the amount of data or information requested or required.
5. Each such application shall be accompanied by the following
payments:
a. An application fee approved by the City to cover the cost of
processing the application;
b. A deposit, if applicable, for any cut into or excavation of the
ROW, as provided in Section 520.080 hereof; and

including but not limited to prior delinquent fees, costs, and
any loss, damage, or expense suffered by the City because of
the applicant's prior work in the rights-of-way or for any
emergency actions taken by the City, but the Director may
modify this requirement to the extent the Director determines
any such fees to be in good-faith dispute or beyond the ability
of the applicant to control.
6. Applications shall be reviewed and acted upon within the
timeframes provided in this Article. The City acknowledges that
Federal law or regulations may prescribe deadlines not consistent
with those included in this Article, but the certainty of such Federal
deadlines cannot be effectively ascertained and prescribed herein.
It shall be incumbent upon the applicant to inform the City of any
desire to utilize Federal deadlines and to explain the applicability of
same at the time of application. The Director shall include a
Federal deadline option on the City's form application.
B. Application Review And Determination.
1. The Director shall promptly review each application for a ROW
permit that is complete and in compliance with all application
requirements. The Director shall grant or deny all such
applications within thirty-one (31) days of their receipt. Unless the
application is denied, the Director shall issue a ROW permit upon
determining that the applicant:
a. Has submitted all necessary information;
b. Has paid the appropriate fees; and
Section
520.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.060
AO:967
c. Is in full compliance with this Chapter and all other City
ordinances.
In order to avoid excessive processing and accounting costs
to either the City or the applicant, the Director may establish
procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic
payment of fees to avoid excessive processing and accounting
costs.
2. It is the intention of the City that interference with, damage to,
excavation or disruption of, or the placement of facilities within, the
City's rights-of-way should be minimized and limited in scope to the
extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of this Chapter.
When reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the
Director may require as alternatives to the proposed ROW work
either less disruptive methods or different locations for facilities,
provided that any required alternative:
a. Shall not increase expenses by more than ten percent (10%) of
the applicant's costs for the work as proposed,
b. Shall not result in a decline of service quality, and
c. Shall be competitively neutral and non-discriminatory.
The Director shall provide to the applicant the reasons why
the required alternative is reasonable and necessary.
3. Upon receipt of an application, the Director shall determine
whether any portion of the rights-of-way will be affected by the
proposed work and whether the interference, disruption, or
placement of facilities will be more than minor in nature. In
determining whether the proposed work is more than minor in
nature the Director shall consider the nature and scope of the
work, its location and duration, and its effect on the rights-of-way,
the use thereof, and neighboring properties.
a. If the applicant can show to the Director's reasonable
satisfaction that the work involves no interference, disruption,
excavation, or damage to, or only minor interference, with, the
rights-of-way, or that the work does not involve the placement
of facilities or involves time-sensitive maintenance, then the
Director shall promptly grant the ROW permit.
b. If the Director determines that the effect on the rights-of-way
will be more than minor in nature and no exemption under the
above paragraph (3)(a) or any other provision of this Chapter
applies, the Director shall schedule and coordinate the work
and grant the ROW permit accordingly. When reasonable and
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Chapter, the
Director may postpone issuance of a ROW permit, and may
give public notice of the application in an attempt to identify
Section
520.060
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.060
AO:968
whether any other person intends to do work in the same area
within a reasonable period of time, so that all ROW work in
the area can be coordinated. Due regard shall be accorded
applicants that are required by any law, rule, regulation,
license, or franchise to provide service to the area defined in
the application. The Director shall not impose any coordination
or scheduling requirements that prevent or unreasonably delay
an applicant's access to the ROW or that create a barrier to
entry.
c. Applicants shall participate in any joint planning, construction
and advance notification of such work, including coordination
and consolidation of any excavation of or disturbance to the
rights-of-way, as directed by the Director. Applicants shall
cooperate with each other and other ROW users and the City
for the best, most efficient, least intrusive, most aesthetic, and
least obtrusive performance of ROW work and use of the ROW.
d. The Director shall provide contact information permitting
applicants to ascertain whether existing capacity may be
available from other persons utilizing the rights-of-way along
the intended path of any proposed work. The Director shall
also maintain indexes of all ROW permits issued, both by the
ROW user and by the affected rights-of-way.
e. The grant of a ROW permit shall not eliminate the need of an
applicant to obtain: (i) any other permit required by law for the
construction or installation of facilities within the ROW, or (ii)
any other authority necessary for the placement or attachment
of facilities on property other than the ROW.
4. In addition, the following provisions shall apply to above-ground
facilities:
a. The design, location, nature, and construction of above-ground
facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Director as provided herein and as otherwise required by law.
Such review shall be non-discriminatory and competitively
neutral and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld.
b. In considering the application the Director shall consider the
requirements of towers and antennas as contained in Chapter
440 of the Municipal Code and shall apply those requirements
to the extent practicable and consistent with the purposes and
intent of this code, but no special antenna permit shall be
required for the placement of such facilities in the ROW.
c. The Director may designate certain locations or facilities in the
ROW to be excluded from use by the applicant for its facilities,
including, but not limited to:
(1) Ornamental or similar specially designed street lights,
Section
520.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.060
AO:969
(2) Designated historic areas,
(3) Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that do not
have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the
proposed facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or
wind loading thereof,
(4) Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that in the
reasonable judgment of the Director, are incompatible
with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe
or unstable by the installation, and
(5) Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that have
been designated or planned for other use or are not
otherwise available for use by the applicant due to
engineering, technological, proprietary, legal or other
limitations or restrictions.
d. The design and placement of above-ground facilities shall:
(1) Maximize use of structures on which such facilities already
exist;
(2) Avoid interference with existing driveways, sidewalks, or
other pedestrian or vehicle paths (antennas shall not be
located less than eight (8) feet above grade);
(3) Be located no closer to similar facilities as may be
necessary for service delivery, so as to minimize adverse
visual impacts and preserve property values;
(4) Not inhibit the current or future use of the ROW;
(5) Be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective or
metallic (black, gray and tan shall be considered neutral
colors, as shall any color that blends with the surrounding
dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities);
(6) Be screened sufficiently to reasonably conceal the facility,
if the facility is taller than three (3) feet in height or
exceeds four (4) square feet in size, with the person having
facilities within the ROW being responsible for the
installation, repair, or replacement of screening materials;
(7) Not emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and shall
comply with all other applicable regulations and standards
established by the State, Federal, or local law; and
(8) Meet such additional physical criteria as reasonably
determined by the Director.
5. If the application of any provision of this Code excludes locations
for facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts with the
Section
520.060
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.060
AO:970
reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director shall
cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find
suitable alternatives.
6. The grant of a ROW permit shall not eliminate the need to have
obtained a license, permit or other agreement for attaching
facilities to other facilities, poles or other structures, whether
owned by the City or another person.
7. Nothing in this Code shall be construed to require that the City any
person access to any City facilities or the City's proprietary
property, but the City may enter into separate agreements to allow
such access. Such agreements may include the payment of rent or
reasonable attachment fees for use of City facilities or other City
property. All such agreements shall be non-discriminatory and
competitively neutral among wireless transmission providers.
C. Permit Issuance And Denial.
1. Each ROW permit issued by the Director shall include:
a. Projected commencement and termination dates or, if such
dates are unknown at the time the permit is issued, a provision
requiring the ROW user to provide the Director with
reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are
determined;
b. Length of affected rights-of-way, number of road crossings, and
identification and description of any pavement or curb cuts
included in the work;
c. Information regarding scheduling and coordination of work, if
necessary;
d. The location of any of the applicant's facilities, both those
proposed and existing, and the location of any known facilities
owned by another person that may be affected by the proposed
work;
e. An acknowledgement and representation by the applicant to
comply with the terms and conditions of the ROW permit and
this Chapter; and
f. Such conditions and requirements as are deemed reasonably
necessary by the Director to protect structures and other
facilities in the rights-of-way from damage, to restore such
rights-of-way, and any structures or facilities, to ensure the
reasonable continuity and sight-lines of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic, and to protect property values, the aesthetics
of adjoining properties and neighborhoods, and the public
health, safety and welfare.

520.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.060
AO:971
2. An applicant receiving a ROW permit shall promptly notify the
Director of any material changes in the information submitted in
the application. The Director may issue a revised ROW permit or
require that the ROW user reapply for a ROW permit in accordance
with all requirements of this code.
3. ROW permits inure to the benefit of the applicant and the rights
granted thereunder may not be assigned or transferred to any
other person without the written consent of the Director.
4. The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in
the public interest, for the following reasons:
a. Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;
b. Failure to provide information required by the application or
this code;
c. The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this code or
other pertinent and applicable City ordinances;
d. Failure to return the ROW to its previous condition under
previously issued ROW permits or after prior excavations by
the applicant;
e. For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity, as
defined by applicable Federal, State or local law;
f. For the applicant's refusal to comply with alternative ROW
work methods, locations, or other reasonable conditions
required by the Director; and
g. For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, provided that such denial does not fall within the
exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service Commission
or interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of
private property, and provided further that such denial is
imposed on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory
basis.
D. Permit Revocation And Ordinance Violation.
1. The Director may revoke a ROW permit without fee refund after
notice and an opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the permit or this
Chapter. Prior to revocation the Director shall provide written
notice to the ROW user identifying any substantial breach and
allowing a reasonable period of time not longer than thirty (30)
days to cure the problem, which cure period may be immediate if
certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety. The
cure period shall be extended by the Director on good cause shown
by the ROW user. A substantial breach, includes, but is not limited
to, the following:
Section
520.060
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.060
AO:972
Section 520.070. Work In The Rights-Of-Way. [Ord. No. 2591 §§ 1 —
2, 8-23-2016]
a. A material violation of a provision of the ROW permit or this
Chapter;
b. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
ROW permit or this Chapter, or the perpetration or attempt to
perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its residents;
c. A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW permit
application;
d. A failure to complete ROW work by the date specified in the
ROW permit, unless an extension is obtained or unless the
failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the ROW
user's control; and
e. A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to
cure as specified by the Director, work that does not conform to
applicable national safety ordinances, industry construction
standards, this Chapter or any other applicable ordinances,
provided that City standards are no more stringent than those
of a national safety ordinance.
2. Any breach of the terms and conditions of a ROW permit shall also
be deemed a violation of this Chapter, and in lieu of revocation the
Director may initiate prosecution of the ROW user for such
violation.
E. Private Streets. Notwithstanding anything in this Code to the contrary,
the City has no authority to grant a ROW user the right to install or
maintain facilities or to perform work in any private street; provided,
however, the City shall regulate any ROW work in any private street
under its inherent police power and as provided in this Code for
purposes of public health and safety. Doing so is not intended and may
not be considered as an exercise of jurisdiction over such private street
for the purposes of public use or maintenance.
A. Jurisdiction, Inspection, Permit Deadlines, Stop Work Orders, And
Liability.
1. No person shall perform any excavation in the ROW without
providing proof of security for such work or for the restoration and
maintenance of the ROW as provided in Section 520.080, below. In
the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the person
conducting the work shall provide the required proof as soon as
practicable following the commencement of the work, not to
exceed the third business day thereafter.
2. All facilities and ROW work shall be subject to inspection by the
City and the supervision of all Federal, State and local authorities
Section
520.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.070
AO:973
having jurisdiction in such matters to ensure compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations,
and the ROW permit. The City shall charge an inspection fee in an
amount determined by the Director.
3. ROW work shall commence within thirty (30) calendar days after
the issuance of the permit and if not so commenced, such permit
shall be deemed terminated. Permits so terminated may be
renewed upon the payment of an additional permit fee as originally
required. Every permit shall expire at the end of the period of time
set out in the permit. If the ROW user is unable to commence or to
complete the work within the specified time, the ROW user shall,
prior to the expiration date, present in writing to the Director a
request for an extension of time setting forth the reasons for the
requested extension. If the Director determines that such an
extension is necessary and not contrary to the public interest, the
ROW user may be granted additional time for the completion of the
work.
4. The Director shall have full access to all portions of the ROW work
and may issue stop work orders and corrective orders to prevent
unauthorized or substandard work. Such orders:
a. May be delivered personally or by certified mail to the
address(es) listed on the application for the ROW permit or the
person in charge of the construction site at the time of
delivery;
b. Shall state that substandard work or work not authorized by
the ROW permit is being carried out, summarize the
substandard or unauthorized work and provide a period of not
longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure
period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped
to protect the public safety; and
c. May be enforced by equitable action in the Circuit Court of St.
Louis County, Missouri, and in such case the person
responsible for the substandard or unauthorized work shall be
liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the City in
enforcing such orders, including reasonable attorney's fees, in
addition to any and all penalties established in this Chapter.
B. Installation Of Facilities.
1. In conjunction with the City's long-standing policy favoring
underground construction, no person may erect, construct or
install new poles or other facilities above the surface of the rightsof-
way without the written permission of the City, unless the City's
authority has been preempted by State or Federal law. Such
permission may be granted through a ROW permit when other
similar facilities exist above-ground or when conditions are such
that underground construction is impossible, impractical or
Section
520.070
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.070
AO:974
economically unfeasible, as determined by the City, and when in
the City's judgment the above-ground construction has minimal
aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed.
2. During installation of facilities and to the extent authorized by law,
existing underground conduits shall be used whenever feasible and
permitted by the owner thereof.
3. In the case of new construction or property development, the
developer or property owner shall give reasonable written notice,
to other potential ROW users as directed by the City, of the
particular date on which open trenching will be available for
installation of facilities. Costs of trenching and easements required
to bring facilities within the development shall be borne by the
developer or property owner; except that if the facilities are not
installed within five (5) working days of the date the trenches are
available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or
property owner, then once the trenches are thereafter closed, the
cost of new trenching shall be borne by the person installing the
facilities.
4. Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so
as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and shall comply
with all other applicable regulations and standards established by
the City or State or Federal law.
C. Relocation Of Equipment And Facilities.
1. In the event of an emergency, or where construction equipment or
facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger to
health, safety, or property, the City may, to the extent allowed by
law, remove, re-lay, or relocate such construction equipment, or the
pertinent parts of such facilities, without charge to the City for
such action or for restoration or repair. The City shall attempt to
notify the person having facilities within the ROW prior to taking
such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent same.
Thereafter, the City shall notify the person having facilities within
the ROW as soon as practicable.
2. At the City's direction and as may be permitted by law, all facilities
shall be moved underground and the cost shall be solely the
obligation of the person having facilities within the ROW (or as
otherwise allowed or required by law).
3. Any person having facilities within the ROW shall, within a
reasonable time specified by the City, protect, support, disconnect,
relocate or remove, at its own expense, construction equipment or
discrete portions of its facilities when required by the City by
reason of traffic conditions; public safety; rights-of-way
construction, maintenance or repair (including resurfacing or
widening); change of rights-of-way grade or boundaries;
construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes,
Section
520.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.070
AO:975
power lines, signal lines, tracks or any type of government-owned
communications system, public work or improvement or any
government-owned utility; rights-of-way vacation; or for any other
purpose where the convenience of the City would be reasonably
served thereby. This requirement shall not apply when the person
having facilities within the ROW holds a valid easement that
existed prior to the date when the area in question became rightsof-
way. The person having facilities within the ROW shall bear the
burden of establishing to the City's satisfaction the fact of the preexisting
easement.
4. Any person having facilities within the ROW shall, on the request of
the City or any person authorized by the City, temporarily relocate
facilities to permit the moving of buildings or oversized vehicles.
5. A person having facilities within the ROW shall, on the reasonable
request of any person and after reasonable advance written notice,
protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or remove facilities to
accommodate such person, and the actual cost, reasonably
incurred, of such actions shall be paid by the person requesting
such action. The person having facilities within the ROW taking
such action may require such payment in advance.
6. Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW
user may abandon the facilities if approved by the City as provided
in Subsection (F) of this Section.
7. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property, and no
person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location
of any facilities within the rights-of-way shall be a vested interest.
D. Property Repair And Alterations.
1. During any ROW work, the person doing the work shall protect
from damage any and all existing structures and property
belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all rights-ofway,
public property, or private property disturbed or damaged
during the work shall be repaired or replaced by the person doing
the work or the person on whose behalf the work is being done, and
such person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of any
damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed
within a reasonable time specified by the Director and to the
Director's satisfaction.
2. Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage
system or to any City, State or other public structures or facilities in
the rights-of-way required on account of the construction,
installation, repair or maintenance of facilities within the rights-ofway
shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such
facilities.
E. Removal, Abandonment, Transfer, And Relocation Of Facilities.
Section
520.070
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.070
AO:976
1. If a registration is terminated, the City may require that the person
having facilities within the ROW remove its facilities from the
rights-of-way at the person's expense. In removing its facilities the
person shall obtain a ROW permit and restore any excavation that
shall be made by it as required by this code. The liability, indemnity,
insurance and bonding requirements as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during and after the period of
removal and restoration and until full compliance by the person
with the terms and conditions of this paragraph and the
requirements of this code.
2. If a person having facilities within the ROW installs the facilities
without having complied with the requirements of this code, the
City may:
a. Require the removal of the facilities,
b. Remove the facilities at the expense of the person having
facilities within the ROW, or
c. Require the transfer of the facilities as provided herein.
3. If a person having facilities within the ROW:
a. Discontinues use of any facility for a continuous period of
twelve (12) months;
b. Has installed the facilities without complying with the
requirements of this code; or
c. Declares the facilities abandoned or if such facilities are:
(1) No longer in active use;
(2) No longer capable of being used for the same or similar
purpose for which the facilities were installed; or
(3) Are physically disconnected from any other facility that is
in use or in service;
Then the facilities may be deemed abandoned. If such
abandonment occurs, the City may require the removal
of the facilities, remove the facilities at the expense of
the person having facilities within the ROW, allow the
abandonment of the facilities without removal or require
the transfer of the facilities, all as provided in this
Subsection (6).
4. If the City requires removal of the facilities, the person shall obtain
a ROW permit and shall abide by all requirements of this Chapter.
The liability, indemnity, insurance and bonding requirements
required herein shall continue in full force and effect during and
after the period of removal and restoration and until full
Section
520.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.070
AO:977
compliance by the person with the terms and conditions of the
ROW permit and the requirements of this Chapter.
5. If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been
directed to do so, the City may, to the extent permitted by law:
a. Have the removal done at the person's expense.
b. Deem the facilities abandoned, without removal, if the Director
determines that abandonment is not likely to prevent or
significantly impair the future use, repair, excavation,
maintenance, or construction of the ROW.
c. Determine that the ownership of the facilities should be
transferred to the City, or to such person as directed by the
City. In either case the owner of the facilities shall submit a
written instrument, satisfactory in form to City, transferring to
the City, or to such person as directed by the City, ownership of
the facilities. The City may sell, assign, or transfer all or part of
the facilities so transferred.
6. The City shall not remove any facilities unless the existence of such
facilities prevents or significantly impairs the use, repair,
excavation or construction of the ROW. The City shall not remove or
seek to possess or transfer the facilities until thirty (30) days have
passed following written notice by the Director to the person
having facilities within The ROW of the City's intent to so act. The
Director may choose not to act on good cause shown by the person
having facilities within the ROW.
F. Standards For ROW Work.
1. Except for emergency ROW work as provided in Section
520.060(A)(1), ROW work shall be performed only upon issuance
and in accordance with the requirements and scope of a ROW
permit. At all times during the work, ROW permits shall be
conspicuously displayed at the work site and shall be available for
inspection by the Director. No ROW user shall perform any ROW
work not authorized by a permit.
2. If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the ROW work
is or will become materially different from that allowed by the ROW
permit, the ROW user shall inform the Director. The Director may
issue a waiver, an extension or a revised ROW permit, or require
that the ROW user reapply for a ROW permit in accordance with all
requirements of this code.
3. ROW users shall not open or encumber more of the rights-of-way
than is reasonably necessary to complete the ROW work in the
most expeditious manner or allow excavations to remain open
longer than is necessary to complete the work.
Section
520.070
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.070
AO:978
a. No ROW work shall extend beyond the centerline of the street
before being backfilled or the surface of the street temporarily
restored in a manner satisfactory to the Director.
b. No ROW work shall prevent the reasonable use of such street
by the public or cause substantial hazards.
c. All ROW work that affects vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall
be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected at the
ROW user's expense. The ROW user shall be responsible for
providing adequate traffic control to the area surrounding the
work as determined by the Director.
d. The ROW user shall perform the ROW work at such times that
will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic
and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, as permitted by
the Director. Unless otherwise provided by the Director in the
permit, non-emergency ROW work on arterial and collector
streets may not be accomplished during the hours of 7:00 a.m.
to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in order to minimize
disruption of traffic flow.
4. Excavations.
a. No ROW user shall make or cause to be made any excavation in
any ROW without adequately protecting the same by erecting
such fencing or other barriers as the Director deems adequate
to prevent persons, animals or vehicles from falling into said
excavation. Said barriers may include warning signs by day
and red torches or their equivalent by night, which shall be
placed and maintained around any such excavation as to give
reasonable notice and warning to any person approaching such
excavation from any direction. The Director may require
additional safety regulations a may be in conformity with the
requirements of Federal or State law or regulation.
b. Excavated materials shall be laid compactly along the side of
the trench and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little
inconvenience as possible to public travel. In order to expedite
the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, the
Director may require the ROW user to provide toe boards or
bins; and if the excavated area is muddy and causes
inconvenience to pedestrians, temporary wooden plank walks,
footbridges, or coverings shall be installed as required by the
Director. If the street is not wide enough to hold the excavated
material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, the ROW
user shall keep a passageway at least one-half (1/2) the
sidewalk width open along such sidewalk line.
c. When any earth, gravel or other excavated material is caused
to roll, flow or wash upon any street, the ROW user shall cause
Section
520.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.070
AO:979
the same to be removed from the street within four (4) hours
after deposit.
5. Notice.
a. The ROW user shall notify the City no less than three (3)
working days in advance of any ROW work that would require
any street closure or would reduce traffic flow to less than two
(2) lanes of moving traffic for more than four (4) hours. Except
in the event of emergency ROW work, no such closure shall
take place without notice and prior authorization from the City.
b. The ROW user shall provide written notice to all property
owners within one hundred and eighty-five (185) feet of the
site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to performing the ROW
work. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of
work to be done, the location of work, and the time and
duration of the work.
6. All ROW work shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National
Electrical Safety Code, and other Federal, State, or local laws and
regulations that may apply, including, without limitation, local
health, safety, construction and zoning ordinances, and laws and
accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or
adopted. In the event of a conflict among ordinances and
standards, the most stringent ordinance or standard shall apply
(except insofar as that ordinance or standard, if followed, would
result in facilities that could not meet requirements of Federal,
State or local law).
7. All facilities shall be installed and located to cause minimum
interference with the rights and convenience of property owners,
other ROW users and the City. Facilities shall not be placed where
they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities or public
improvements, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various
utilities serving the residents and businesses in the City or public
improvements.
a. All existing facilities shall be exposed sufficiently ahead of
trench excavation work to avoid damage to those facilities and
to permit their relocation, if necessary.
b. Pipe drains, pipe culverts or other facilities encountered shall
be protected by the ROW user.
c. Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for
the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or
property subdivision or a precise survey reference point or a
permanent survey bench mark within the City shall not be
removed or disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed
unless permission to do so is first obtained in writing from the
Section
520.070
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.070
AO:980
Director. Permission shall be granted only upon condition that
the ROW user shall pay all expenses incident to the proper
replacement of the monument.
8. All ROW work shall be conducted in accordance with good
engineering practices, performed by experienced and properly
trained personnel so as not to endanger any person or property or
to unreasonably interfere in any manner with the rights-of-ways or
legal rights of any property owner, including the City, or
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
9. All safety practices required by law shall be used during ROW
work, including commonly accepted methods and devices to
prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injury, or nuisance to the public.
10. Any contractor or subcontractor of a ROW user must be properly
licensed under laws of the State and all applicable local ordinances,
and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same
obligations with respect to its work as a ROW user would have
pursuant to this Chapter. A ROW user:
a. Must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all
employees performing ROW work are trained and experienced,
b. Shall be responsible for ensuring that all work is performed
consistent with the ROW permit and applicable law,
c. Shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of
contractors or subcontractors,
d. Shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions
by any contractor or subcontractor, and
e. Shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the
work is properly performed.
11. A ROW user shall not place or cause to be placed any sort of signs,
advertisements or other extraneous markings on the facilities or in
the ROW, whether relating to the ROW user or any other person,
except such necessary minimal markings approved by the City as
necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance
or emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be
affixed by applicable law or regulation.
12. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the City, a ROW user shall
not remove, cut, or damage any trees, or their roots, within the
ROW.
13. Street crossings will be bored at the direction of the Director.
G. Restoring And Maintaining The Rights-Of-Way.
Section
520.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.070
AO:981
1. To complete any ROW work, the ROW user shall restore the ROW
and surrounding areas, including but not limited to any pavement,
foundation, concrete slabs or curbs, screening, landscaping, or
vegetation and shall comply with other reasonable conditions of the
Director. Restoration of the ROW shall be completed within the
dates specified in the ROW permit unless the Director issues a
waiver, extension or a new or revised ROW permit.
2. It shall be the duty of any person making an excavation in the ROW
to backfill such excavations and restore the surface in accordance
with the City's minimum prescribed standards for such surfaces, as
may be determined and published by the Director.
3. If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the date specified
either by the ROW permit, or any extension thereof as granted by
the Director, the City may perform its own restoration. The City
may also opt to perform its own restoration regardless of any
failure by the ROW user, in which case the ROW permit, or any
amendment or revision thereto, shall note such option. In either
event, if the City performs the restoration the ROW user shall be
responsible for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual
restoration costs within thirty (30) days of invoice.
4. Every ROW user to whom a ROW permit has been granted shall
guarantee for a period of four (4) years the restoration of the ROW
in the area where the ROW user conducted excavation. During this
period the ROW user shall, upon notification from the Director,
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary as required by
the Director. Said work shall be completed within a reasonable
time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the
Director's notice unless otherwise permitted by the Director. If a
ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the time specified, the
City may perform the work and the ROW user shall be responsible
for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual restoration costs
within thirty (30) days of invoice. The Director may extend the cure
period on good cause shown.
5. A ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete the
necessary right-of-way restoration and maintenance because of the
existence of any performance bond required by this Chapter.
H. After the completion of ROW work the ROW user shall provide to the
City as-built drawings, maps or other comparable records as
determined by the Director, drawn to scale and certified to the City as
reasonably depicting the location of all facilities constructed pursuant
to the ROW permit. Such records may be provided to the Director in the
form maintained by the ROW user, but when available to the ROW user,
shall be submitted in automated formats compatible with the City's
systems, such as AUTOCAD.DXF, AUTOCAD.DWG,
MICROSTATION.DGN (or comparable as allowed by the Director), or in
hard copy otherwise.

Section 520.080. Security Deposit; Bonds; Insurance; Surety;
Indemnification; Penalties. [Ord. No. 2591 §§ 1 — 2, 8-23-2016]
A. Security Required. A ROW user shall not perform any ROW work
without complying with the security requirements of this Section.
B. Security Deposit.
1. A ROW user shall submit a cash deposit in the sum of two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00), or other such amount as may be determined by
the Director, for any cut to or excavation of the ROW. The deposit
shall be to secure the proper restoration of the ROW by the ROW
user after completion of the work. Whenever a ROW user applies
for more than one (1) cut or excavation, the ROW user may post a
single deposit in an amount determined by the Director to cover the
anticipated costs of restoration.
2. The Director shall inspect the ROW user's restoration of the ROW
for compliance with the City's standards. Upon the ROW user's
timely and successful restoration as evidenced by the Director's
issuance of a certificate of final inspection, the City shall refund to
the ROW user the security deposit.
3. If the ROW user fails to restore the cut or excavation to required
standards within a reasonable amount of time, then after notice
and a reasonable opportunity to cure the Director may effect the
proper restoration of the ROW and the use of the security deposit
for such purposes. In this event the City shall be entitled to any
damages or loss suffered by the City as a result.
4. If any deposit is less than sufficient to pay the City's costs and
damages, the ROW user shall pay to the City an amount equal to
the deficiency. If the ROW user fails or refuses to pay such
deficiency, the City may institute an action to recover the same in
any court of competent jurisdiction and shall be entitled to a
reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees. Until such deficiency is
paid in full, no additional permits shall be issued to the ROW user.
C. Performance And Maintenance Bonds.
1. For any ROW user having less than twenty-five million dollars
($25,000,000.00) in net assets and a history of non-compliance with
State and local regulations, the Director may, in addition to, in
combination, with, or in lieu of the security deposit required,
permit a ROW user to establish in the City's favor a performance
and maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the
Director to ensure the ROW work and the restoration of the rightof-
way. The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of twenty-four (24) months following completion of the work. The
Director shall have the authority to extend the maintenance bond
period for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months.

2. If a ROW user fails to complete the ROW work in a safe, timely, and
competent manner, or if the completed restorative work fails
without remediation within the time period for the bond (as
determined by the Director), then after notice and a reasonable
opportunity to cure there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally
from the principal and surety of the bond any damages or loss
suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment
of any property of the ROW user and the cost of completing work
within or restoring the rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance
for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The City may
also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a
security fund or letter of credit where such amount exceeds that
available under a security fund or letter of credit.
3. Upon completion of ROW work to the satisfaction of the Director
and upon lapse of the bond period, including any extension by the
Director, the City shall release the bond.
4. The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of
insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition,
shall be subject to the approval of the City's attorney and shall
contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be cancelled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty
(60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent
to cancel or not to renew."
5. In lieu of any bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in
the City's favor such other security as the Director may determine
to be commensurate with the noted bonding requirements,
including but not limited to an annual bond to be maintained in the
minimum amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).
D. Insurance.
1. All ROW users shall maintain, for the duration of any ROW work
and, when applicable, for as long as the ROW user has facilities
within the rights-of-way, at least the following liability insurance
coverage: worker's compensation and employer liability insurance
to meet all requirements of Missouri law and commercial general
liability insurance with respect to the construction, operation, and
maintenance of the facilities, and the conduct of the ROW user's
business in the City, in the minimum amounts of:
a. Three millions dollars ($3,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one (1) accident;
b. Five millions dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal bodily injury
or death resulting from any one (1) accident; and
Section
520.080
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
520.080
AO:984
c. Three millions dollars ($3,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability.
These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit
the liability of any person or to impose any liability on the City
or to waive any sovereign immunity.
2. All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business
in the State of Missouri, with an "A" or better rating of insurance by
Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, and in a form
approved by the City.
3. All insurance policies shall be available for review by the City, and a
ROW user having facilities within the rights-of-way shall keep on
file with the City current certificates of insurance.
4. All general liability insurance policies shall name the City, its
officers, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners,
agents, and employees as additional insureds and shall further
provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be
effective unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof has
been given to the Director. A ROW user shall not cancel any
required insurance policy without submission of proof that it has
obtained alternative insurance that complies with this Chapter.
5. The Director may exempt in writing from these insurance
requirements any self-insured ROW user, provided that the ROW
user demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that the ROW
user's self-insurance plan is commensurate with said requirements
and that the ROW user has sufficient resources to meet all potential
risks, liabilities and obligations contemplated by the requirements
of this Chapter. The Director may require a security fund or letter
of credit as a condition to a self-insured's exemption. The Director
shall waive this requirement when the ROW user has twenty-five
million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a
history of non-compliance with applicable regulatory law.
E. Indemnification.
1. Any ROW user granted a ROW permit, and any person having
facilities within the rights-of-way, as partial consideration for the
privilege granted, shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify,
hold harmless, and defend the City, its officials, boards, board
members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees,
against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and
judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of: (i) any
ROW work, including but not limited to the construction,
maintenance, repair, or replacement of the of facilities, (ii) the

3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Chapter, the City shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in
relation to any amounts attributable to: (i) the City's own
negligence, willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, or (ii)
the City acting in a proprietary capacity to deliver service(s) within
the City.
4. Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, a
performance bond, or otherwise does not limit a person's duty to
indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a
person of amounts owed to the City, or in any respect prevent the
City from exercising any other right or remedy it may have.

within a reasonable period of time, the Director also shall make a final
determination as to any other issue relating to the use of the ROW, the
imposition of any fee or the application of any provision of this Chapter,
provided, however, that this review shall not apply to matters being
prosecuted in the municipal court. Any final determination of the
Director shall be subject to review as provided herein.

the interfaces. Special compression adaptors or field unions
shall be used where connections are made to street sewers,
building or house drains, cut pipe or to pipe lines already in
place.
3. Grades and directions.
a. Unless otherwise authorized, all house sewers shall have a
grade of not less than one-eighth (?) of an inch per foot. A
grade of one-fourth (¼) inch per foot should be used whenever
practical. Whenever possible, the connecting sewer shall join
the building at an elevation which is below the basement floor
of such building.
b. Changes in direction in drainage piping shall be made by the
appropriate use of forty-five degree (45°) wyes, long or short
sweep quarter bends, sixth (6th), eighth (8th) or sixteenth
(16th) bends or by a combination of these or by the use of
equivalent fittings or combinations of other types. Short
quarter bends may be used in drainage lines only where the
flow is from horizontal to vertical.
4. Trenching and backfilling. All excavations shall be open-trench
work unless otherwise authorized by the City inspector. The
foundation in the trench shall be formed to prevent any subsequent
settlement of the pipes. If the foundation is good, firm earth, the
earth shall be pared or molded to give a full support to the lower
third of each pipe. Bell holes shall be dug. Where the floor of the
trench is of hard or rocky material, the trench shall be excavated to
four (4) inches below grade and brought back to the proper grade
with fine gravel, coarse sand or similar material so as to provide a
firm foundation and uniform support for the house sewer line.
Backfilling shall be placed in layers and solidly tamped or packed
up to two (2) feet above pipe. Backfilling shall not be done until
final inspection has been made and approval secured from the
office of the Building Official.
5. Tunneling. Tunneling for distances of not more than six (6) feet in
either direction is permissible in yards, courts or driveways of any
building site. Tunneling for longer distances will require written
permission from the office of the Building Official.

6. Boring or drilling. Boring or drilling is permissible, but if bore or
drill hole exceeds the outside diameter of the pipe by more than
one (1) inch, pressure grouting is to be forced around the pipe
throughout its length.
7. Repair of right-of-way. No connection to a sanitary sewer system
shall be finally approved until all streets, pavements, curbs or other
improvements thereon have been restored to their former
condition and approved by the City inspector.
8. Use of old house sewers. Old house sewers or portions thereof may
be approved for use by the City inspector. The inspector may
request that the old sewer be excavated for the purpose of
facilitating inspection. No old cesspool or septic tank shall be
connected to any portion of a house sewer that is also connected to
a sanitary sewer. All replacements of old sewer lines or sections
thereof shall meet standards set out in this Article.
9. Workmanship. Workmanship shall conform to accepted good
practice so as to fully secure the results sought in all Sections of
this Article.
10. Materials damaged and defective. All materials used in drainage or
plumbing systems shall be free from manufacturing defects or
damage incurred in shipping, handling or installation.
11. Secondhand materials. Secondhand materials are prohibited
except as specifically permitted in other Sections of these rules and
regulations.
12. Sewers in driveways. Building sewer laid in driveways and other
locations where pipe is subjected to breakage or freezing shall not
be less than eighteen (18) inches below the surface grade, unless it
is constructed of cast iron.
13. Building trap. The building trap (fresh air trap) when used shall be
located in the house sewer outside the building as near as possible
to the property line which is adjacent to the lateral sewer and shall
be provided with a fresh air inlet of the same size as the trap and on
the building side of the trap. Fresh air inlets shall be maintained
sufficiently high above grade to prevent being covered by dirt,
sodding or paving and to prevent entrance of surface water and
shall be protected by an iron perforated grate permanently fixed in
the mouth of the inlet.
When it is necessary to locate a building trap (fresh air trap) inside
of a building, it shall be placed in a readily accessible position just
inside the foundation wall nearest the building sewer with one (1)
cleanout brought three (3) inches above the finished floor level of
the sewer side of the trap. A fresh air vent not less than four (4)
inches in diameter shall be installed on the inlet side of the sanitary
building trap, shall be provided with a cleanout at the finished

Residential Sanitary Sewer Lateral Repair Program Policy and
Procedure
Section 535.150. Collection of Fee. [R.O. 2008 §220.300; Ord. No.
2197, 11-25-2003; Ord. No. 2228, 5-11-2004]
The Collector of taxes of St. Louis County is hereby directed to collect, on
behalf of the City of Olivette, an annual sewer lateral fee in the amount of
fifty dollars ($50.00) on residential property for each lateral sewer service
line serving six (6) or fewer dwelling units on that property and
condominiums that have six (6) or less condominium units per building
and any condominium responsible for its own individual lateral sewer line
to provide funds to pay the cost of certain repairs of lateral sewer lines,
effective with the billing of 2004 tax year ad valorem taxes to property
owners in the City of Olivette.
Section 535.160. General. [R.O. 2008 §220.301; Ord. No. 2197,
11-25-2003; Ord. No. 2228, 5-11-2004; Ord. No. 2416 §1, 12-8-2009]
A. The owner of a single-family home, duplex, condominium building or
multi-family building containing not more than six (6) dwelling units
may participate in the Olivette Sewer Lateral Program if the lateral
sewer service line serving the property is found to be defective per the
City of Olivette's Residential Sanitary Sewer Lateral Repair Program
Policy and Procedures governing this program. The policies and
procedures stated in this document must be followed in order to
participate in this program. By complying with procedures in this
document, the property owner may recover eighty percent (80%) of the
authorized costs up to a maximum reimbursement of three thousand
five hundred dollars ($3,500.00).
B. Commercial and industrial properties cannot participate in the
program. Multi-family and condominium developments that contain
more than six (6) dwelling units per building are not eligible for this
program.
C. Each owner of a single-family home, duplex, condominium building or a
multi-family building containing not more than six (6) dwelling units
shall be assessed fifty dollars ($50.00) per year on the owner's annual
real estate tax bill. Owners, who are delinquent in paying the tax bill,
will not be allowed to participate in the program.
D. A lateral sewer service line, which is eligible for the program, is a sewer
line, which extends from three (3) feet outside of the building
foundation wall or exterior wall to the sewer main in the street or sewer
easement. It does not include a sewer line located under any part of any
building or structure. A lateral sewer line may be located in a front, side
or rear yard.

Ord. No. 2416 §1, 12-8-2009]
E. Lateral sewer service lines that extend from three (3) feet outside of the
building foundation wall or exterior wall to septic tanks are eligible;
however, repairs to all mechanical, electrical and tank components, and
the drain field for a septic system, are ineligible.
F. A defective lateral sewer service line is defined as a line that is not
functioning properly due to one (1) or more of the following reasons:
1. Collapsed or broken to the extent that adequate flow is not
permitted.
2. Severe off-set of a joint that does not permit adequate flow.
3. Severe backfall or belly that does not permit adequate flow.
4. Severe blockage that cannot be physically cleaned out.
Tree roots growing through the bells and joints of the pipe
are not considered to cause the line to be deemed defective.
Removal of the roots, which is a routine maintenance issue
with older lateral sewer service lines, will allow the line to
function properly and is ineligible for reimbursement.
A. If an owner is experiencing a problem with his sewer service, the owner
must first contact the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District (MSD) and
request that MSD investigate the problem to determine if the source of
the problem is located in the adjacent sewer main which MSD
maintains.
B. If MSD determines that the problem being experienced by the owner is
not caused by the sewer main, the owner must contact a licensed
plumbing company or a licensed drainlayer to have the lateral sewer
service line cabled. (Sometimes the problem is not with the line itself,
but may have become clogged by materials in the line.) As a common
home maintenance expense, the cost of this cabling is not eligible for
reimbursement by the Program.
C. If the problem is not resolved by cabling of the line, the owner must
contact a video camera service company, licensed plumbing company or
a licensed drainlayer to perform a video investigation of the lateral
sewer service line to record a video of the inspection on DVD, report
findings, draw a diagram of the property showing the failure area
relevant to the building and mark the location of all line failures on the
ground surface of the property.

A. The owner must submit an application for participation in the program.
The application packet can be found on the City of Olivette's website,
www.olivette.com or can be obtained at City of Olivette Department of
Public Services, located at 1200 North Price Road, between the hours
of 7:30 A.M. and 4:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.
B. A completed application form is to be submitted to the Department of
Public Services by the property owner with:
1. MSD report documenting that the source of the reported problem
is not located in the sewer main,
2. Written documentation from a licensed plumbing company or
licensed drainlayer that the line could not be opened or describing
the nature of the problem,
3. DVD of video investigation demonstrating failure within the lateral
sewer service line and photographs of the ground markings, both
which serve to locate the line failures,
4. Paid real estate tax receipt, and
5. Three (3) proposals to repair and/or replace the sewer lateral from
licensed drain layers.
All information, submitted to the Department of Public
Services, shall be generated and dated no more than thirty (30)
days prior to the date which the application is submitted.
A. The Department of Public Services reviews the MSD report, plumbing
company or drainlayer report, DVD inspection video, lateral repair
proposals and paid real estate tax receipt and determines eligibility to
participate in the City's program. Once the application and supporting
documents have been reviewed, a letter will be sent to the owner
regarding acceptance into the program.
B. An owner shall have the right to file an appeal for review by the City
Manager within seven (7) days of receipt of the notice of denial of an
owner's application for participation in the program.
A. From the bids received, the owner may hire the contractor, which the
owner determines to be the best contractor to perform the work.
However, as outlined in Subsection (H) below, the Program will only pay
for an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the lowest responsible
bid that was received by the owner, up to the three thousand five
Section
535.180
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section

hundred dollar ($3,500.00) limit. The selected contractor shall obtain
the necessary permits from the City of Olivette and St. Louis County,
and shall perform the work in accordance with all applicable City and
County codes.
B. If the owner requests a change in the scope of the bid or a change in the
bid amount, such changes will only be reimbursed by the program if
approved by the Department of Public Services.
C. The contractor selected by the owner shall be responsible for locating
all underground utilities prior to commencing work.
D. The corrective work, which is subject to reimbursement under the
program, is limited to the excavation and repair of the damaged portion
of the lateral sewer service line and backfilling in a workmanlike
manner. Additional work, such as that which is excluded by Subsections
(E) and (F) below, is not covered by the program and shall be done at
the owner's expense.
E. The costs associated with repairing sidewalks, driveways, street
pavement and lawn and landscaped areas, including landscape
irrigation systems, located within public or private right-of-way or
private properties shall not be covered by the program. The costs
associated with the relocation and repair of utility services shall not be
covered by the program.
F. In the event that primary structures or accessory structures such as,
sheds, garages, porches, decks, swimming pools, etc. or fences, patios,
landscaping and retaining walls, are in the path of the lateral sewer
service line and lie over the damaged portion of the line, the owner will
be responsible for moving and/or relocating any of these items and will
also be responsible for any and all costs associated with moving, and/or
relocation of these items. If the Department of Public Services
determines that the items may not be moved, a new lateral sewer
service line segment shall be installed in an alternate location, which is
subject to the Department of Public Services review and approval. The
owner shall be solely responsible for all costs associated with the
installation in an alternate location.
G. Within sixty (60) days of the completion of the corrective work, the
owner shall notify the Department of Public Services that the work is
complete and shall file the following with the Department:
1. The itemized bill from the contractor and accompanying letter from
the contractor stating that the bill has been paid in full for all work
performed on the property, including those portions of the work
which are not included in the program,
2. Final lien waivers from the contractor,
3. A written statement from the owner that the work has been
completed to the owner's satisfaction, and

4. Signed notarized affidavit form that accompanies the application.
H. Payments will be issued as adequate funds are available as determined
by the Olivette Finance Department. Payments will be issued by the
City in the order that the information required by Subsection (G) of this
Section is received. The City will make a payment to the owner equal to
eighty percent (80%) (up to three thousand five hundred dollars
($3,500.00)) of the corrective work as stipulated in this Section, not to
exceed eighty percent (80%) the amount of the lowest responsible bid.
I. When the Department of Public Services determines that an emergency
or special circumstance exists, such as the owner being incapable of
soliciting bids, the bidding requirements may be waived by the
Department of Public Services. In these special situations, the
Department of Public Services shall obtain a bid from a contractor, and
if the bid is in order, have the contractor perform the work on behalf of
the owner.
J. When the Department of Public Services determines that an alternative
method of repair (e.g. trench less) would be best suited to fix the
identified problem, the Department of Public Services will require the
owner to solicit bids from contractors who perform this specialized type
of work. The Department of Public Services will supply the owner with a
special set of bid specifications for this alternative method of repair.
A. The following costs are eligible for reimbursement under the program,
subject to the provisions of Section 535.200:
1. The cost of video investigation of the sanitary lateral sewer service
line to determine the location and cause of the blockage or leak.
The City will reimburse a maximum of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) for this cost component, which is included in the
program payment limitations described in Sections 535.160,
535.200 and 535.230.
2. The cost of excavation, backfill and repair or replacement of the
defective portion of the lateral sewer service line. This program
does not cover excavation and repair of a defective lateral sewer
service line, which is located under a building or structure.
3. Site restoration is limited to re-establishment of a reasonable grade
using materials on-site.
4. Administrative costs incurred by the City including, but not limited
to, bidding and contract management costs performed by the City
under this policy. Such costs shall include recovery of the
proportional amount of salary and benefits costs incurred in

C. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if the
contemplated street improvements do not exceed a distance more than
twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length and would connect at both ends
with streets that have already been similarly improved, then:
1. The City Council shall cause the same proceedings to be had as are
provided in Section 540.030(A), but the opportunity for owner
protest as provided in Section 540.030(B) shall not be allowed;

solvent content of the equipment. Gravity drains may be utilized to
transfer any solvent spillage to a properly vented holding tank, in
which case the capacity requirement of the dikes or floor pit shall
not be applicable.
6. The machines, customer area and the room enclosing the machines
shall be ventilated with a mechanical ventilation system which shall
satisfy the following requirements:
Section
605.270
OLIVETTE CITY CODE Section
605.280
AO:1062
a. Prevent a build up of perceptible solvent vapor in the customer
area and in the room housing the machines. An air volume of
five hundred (500) cubic feet per minute per machine
withdrawn through perforated openings or grills located at or
near the front base of the machine will satisfy this
requirement.
b. Each dry cleaning device shall be equipped with a mechanical
system of ventilation connected by way of vapor tight conduits
to the outside atmosphere or to an efficient vapor reclaiming
device and so designed as to maintain automatically an air flow
of at least one hundred (100) feet per minute face velocity
through its door whenever it be opened and such system shall
be the sole means by which vapors shall be routinely
discharged from each said dry cleaning device.
c. The ventilation system shall be in continuous operation at all
times when the machines are available for customer use. An
interlock shall be provided which will cause the machines to be
inoperative in the event of a failure in the ventilation system.
d. The air velocity within the duct work shall be sufficient to
prevent solvent condensation and shall be at least two
thousand (2,000) feet per minute.
e. The air discharge from the ventilation system shall extend at
least five (5) feet above the roof elevation and shall be so
located as to prevent effluent air from gaining access to
adjacent buildings, direct-fired heating equipment, air
conditioning and ventilation systems.
f. All interior duct work shall be airtight and under negative
pressure.
g. The room housing the machines shall be equipped with an
auxiliary ventilation system with a minimum capacity of one
thousand (1,000) cubic feet per minute per machine for
emergency use in the event of a serious solvent spillage. The
discharges from this system shall be so located as to preclude
the entry of vapor laden air into adjacent buildings, direct-fired
heating equipment, air-conditioning and ventilation systems.
h. The supply of make up air equal to the volume exhausted
through the ventilation system shall be provided to eliminate
the hazards of negative pressures within the building and
provision shall be made to warm the make up air during cold
weather.
7. The access doors of the machines shall be equipped with an
interlock so that the doors cannot be opened by a customer while
the machine is in operation. The interlock shall be so connected
that in the event of a power failure, the machines will fail safe.
Section

channels for non-commercial public, educational or governmental
("PEG") use as designated by the incumbent cable operator.
B. Any PEG channel that is not substantially utilized by the City may be
reclaimed and programmed by the video service provider at the
provider's discretion. If the City finds and certifies that a channel that
has been reclaimed by a video service provider will be substantially
utilized, the video service provider shall restore the reclaimed channel
within one hundred twenty (120) days. A PEG channel shall be
considered "substantially utilized" when forty (40) hours per week are
locally programmed on that channel for at least three (3) consecutive
months. In determining whether a PEG channel is substantially utilized,
a program may be counted not more than four (4) times during a
calendar week.
C. The operation of any PEG access channel and the production of any
programming that appears on each such channel shall be the sole
responsibility of the City or its duly appointed agent receiving the
benefit of such channel and the video service provider shall bear only
the responsibility for the transmission of the programming on each
such channel to subscribers. The City must deliver and submit to the
video service provider all transmissions of PEG content and
programming in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and
transmitted by such video service provider holder over its network
without further alteration or change in the content or transmission
signal. Such content and programming must be compatible with the
technology or protocol utilized by the video service provider to deliver
its video services. The video service provider shall cooperate with the
City to allow the City to achieve such compatibility.
D. The City shall make the programming of any PEG access channel
available to all video service providers in a non-discriminatory manner.
Each video service provider shall be responsible for providing the
connectivity to the City's or its duly appointed agent's PEG access
channel distribution points existing as of August 27, 2007. Where
technically necessary and feasible, video service providers shall use
reasonable efforts and shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their
video service networks on mutually acceptable rates, terms and
conditions for the purpose of transmitting PEG programming. A video
service provider shall have no obligation to provide such
interconnection to a new video service provider at more than one (1)
point per headend, regardless of the number of political subdivisions

interconnection, including signal transmission from the origination
point to the point of interconnection. Interconnection may be

27, 2007 shall continue until the date of franchise expiration (ignoring
any termination by notice of issuance of a video service authorization)
or January 1, 2012, whichever is earlier. Any other video service
provider shall have the same obligation to support PEG access facilities
as the incumbent cable operator, but if there is more than one (1)
incumbent, then the incumbent with the most subscribers as of August
27, 2007. Such obligation shall be prorated, depending on the nature of
the obligation, as provided in Section 67.2703.8, RSMo. The City shall
notify each video service provider of the amount of such fee on an
annual basis, beginning one (1) year after issuance of the video service
authorization.
F. A video service provider may identify and pass through as a separate
line item on subscribers' bills the value of monetary and other PEG
access support on a proportionate basis.
