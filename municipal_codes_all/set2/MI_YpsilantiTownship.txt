PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Charter Township of Ypsilanti, Michigan. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLES 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 

Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Brenda Stumbo, Township Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the township's affairs.

(1)	Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)	Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)	Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.

(5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Sec. 22-286. Purpose.
Since the state enacted Public Act 188 of 2009 to prohibit smoking in public places smoking lounges have become increasingly popular. Cigar bars and tobacco specialty retail stores that qualify and were in existence on May 1, 2010, are exempt from the smoking in public prohibition.

The purpose of this article is to regulate smoking lounges for the public health, safety, and welfare of the township and persons within its jurisdictional boundaries; to prevent access to tobacco and non-tobacco smoking products by minors at these establishments, and to prevent the spread of smoke fumes to adjacent properties, and persons passing by these establishments.

Sec. 24-57. Purpose.
The township finds that rapid growth, the spread of development, and increasing demands upon natural resources have had the effect of encroaching upon, despoiling, or eliminating many of the trees and other forms of vegetation and natural resources and processes associated therewith which if preserved and maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition, constitutes important physical, aesthetic, recreational, and economic assets to existing and future residents of the township. Specifically, the township finds: 
(1)	That woodland growth protects public health through the absorption of air pollutants and contamination, the buffering of excess noise and wind, the screening of undesirable views, the cooling of buildings in summer and insulating buildings in winter; 
(2)	That woodlands provide for public safety through the prevention of erosion, siltation, and flooding; 
(3)	That trees and woodland growth are an essential component of the general welfare of the township by maintaining natural beauty, recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, and irreplaceable heritage for existing and future township residents; 
(4)	That the protection of such natural resources is a matter of paramount public concern, as provided by Article IV, 552 of the Constitution of 1963, and the Environmental Protection Act of 1970, MCL 691.1201 et seq.; MSA 14.528(201); 
(5)	To protect significant individual trees located on sites subject to development during the course of construction of improvements to benefit the development site and buildings on the site: 
a.	To provide for the protection, preservation, replacement, proper maintenance, and use of trees and woodlands located in the township in order to minimize disturbance to them and to prevent damage from erosion, siltation, and flooding; 
b.	To protect the woodlands (including trees and other forms of vegetation) of the township for their economic support of local property values when allocated to remain uncleared and/or unharvested; 
c.	To protect the woodlands (including trees and other forms of vegetation) of the township for their significance as large specimens of their species and/or rare and endangered species; 
d.	To protect functional strips of vegetation (including fencerows, hedgerows, shrubby borders of streams and public rights-of-ways, railroad-edge and road-edge) of the township for their significance as travel lanes for wildlife, noise buffer, visual screens, aesthetically pleasing enclosures and vistas for pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
e.	To provide for the paramount public concern for these natural resources in the interest of health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the township.

(2)	A use permit application fee in an amount as set by resolution of the township board; 
(3)	Where the applicant is not the owner of the property, a written authorization from the owner permitting the proposed activity; and 
(4)	A site plan including topographical survey, sealed by a registered engineer or registered surveyor, which includes the following information: 
a.	The shape and dimensions of the lot or parcel, together with the existing and proposed locations of structure and improvements, if any; 
b.	Locations, based upon actual field survey, identifying by number all existing trees of eight-inch d.b.h. or greater and all other trees to be protected. All such trees proposed to remain, to be transplanted or to be removed shall be so designated. The plan shall be accompanied by a separate key identifying the trees numbered by size, common and genus name (e.g.: maple/acer), condition, density and spacing. All such trees shall be tagged in the field with their identifying numbers; 
c.	Location, based upon actual field survey, of all primary and secondary linkage strips on the site as well as descriptions of the dominant shrubs and, if present, trees within the association; 
d.	Existing general soil conditions throughout the parcel; 
e.	A statement showing how trees not proposed for removal are to be protected during land clearing, construction, and on a permanent basis, including the proposed use of protective barriers, tree wells, tunneling or retaining walls (see section 24-69, Tree Protection During Construction); 
f.	Location and dimensions of all setbacks, easements, and existing and proposed public and private utilities; 
g.	Statements as to grade changes proposed and proposed drainage pattern changes for the lot or parcel and how such changes will affect these regulations. Existing contour interval of no more than two feet, and vertical contour data at an interval of no more than one foot for all areas to be disturbed by proposed tree removal operations, extending for a distance of at least 50 feet beyond the limits of such areas. Indicated elevations shall be based on United States Geological Survey datum; 
h.	The number of trees to be cut which have a d.b.h. of eight inches or more or the number of shrubs to be cut in a linkage strip, plus a plan and cost estimate for their replacement.

(b)	Alternative site plan information. Where the proposed activity is located on a site with no trees of eight-inch d.b.h. or greater or linkage strips, the applicant shall so indicate in his/her application, and submit a no-tree affidavit. In such case, the township shall conduct an inspection of the site. If the inspection substantiates the applicant's claim, the applicant shall be relieved of the necessity of providing unnecessary information, such as the topographic survey, etc. However, where these are trees less than eight inches d.b.h. that are otherwise potentially good specimens of that particular woodlot or linkage strip, additional information will be required, such as quality, size species, health, and such additional information as the township request. In those instances where areas of woodlands or linkage strips on a site are not to be disturbed, the site plan shall designate such areas as "not to be disturbed" and shall not be required to identify, except for general information as to species, number and size of protected trees and shall further be required to protect such areas from encroachment during construction activities. 
(c)	Land clearing or grubbing. Where the proposed activity is land clearing or grubbing only, the preparation of a site plan which depicts the location of all trees as required by subsection (a)(4)b of this section shall not be required. However, the applicant shall provide general information as to the number, species, and size of the protected trees on the property before a use permit for the clearing or grubbing may be granted. 
(d)	Forest management use permit. An owner may be granted a forest management use permit for the purpose of maintaining and improving a woodlands area by professional forestry management methods. Application for this permit must be accompanied by a management plan for the subject area prepared by a forester licensed and registered in the state. The management plan shall include a description of and a schedule for the program, justifying reasons for the work specified and a summary of the benefits to be obtained. Work under a forest management use permit shall be directed by a licensed and registered forester. Under the forest management use permit, provisions of this article which are applicable solely to development or land clearing activities shall not apply. The township shall not levy any fee for this special permit. 
(e)	De Minimis activities. Where the proposed activities involve the removal of not more than ten trees of eight inches d.b.h. or greater on lots or tracts of up to five acres; not more than 20 trees of eight-inch d.b.h. or greater on the tracts over five acres and up to ten acres; and not more than 30 trees of eight-inch d.b.h. or greater on the tracts over ten acres, and is not taken in conjunction with the development of a parcel. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 10, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-66. Review of use permit application.
(a)	The township administration shall review the submitted use permit application to ensure that all required information has been provided. At the request of the applicant or the township, an administrative review meeting shall be held to review the proposed activity in light of the purpose and review standards of the chapter. A field inspection of the site may be conducted. A report and recommendation shall be prepared by either the township administration or the consultant following the review. 
(b)	After review of the use permit application and site visit by the township administration or consultants, the application shall be granted subject to clarification or denied by one of the following parities. The granting or denial of the use permit shall be governed by the review standards contained in section 24-67. 
(1)	If the subject property is a single-family residential site, the township administration shall process the application. The issuance of permits under these circumstances would not involve the review of the planning commission. The township administration shall consult the township community development director prior to issuing the permit. 
(2)	If the proposed activity does not otherwise require site plans or plat approval (not including activities addressed in subsection (b)(1) of this section) the granting or denying of the use permit shall be the responsibility of the township community development director. 
(3)	The granting or denying of all other use permits shall be the responsibility of the township planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 11, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-67. Review standards.
The following standards shall govern the grant or denial of use permit applications: 
(1)	No application shall be denied solely on the basis that some trees are growing on the property under consideration. However, the protection and conservation of irreplaceable natural resources from pollution, impairment or destruction is a paramount concern. While the preservation of woodlands, trees, linkage strips and endangered species and related natural resources is the object of this article, every effort will be made to meet not only that objective but to preserve the basic property rights of the landowner as well. 
(2)	The integrity of woodland areas shall be maintained irrespective of whether such woodlands cross property lines. 
(3)	Diversity of tree species shall be maintained where essential to preservation of woodland. 
(4)	The removal or relocation of trees or shrubs shall be limited to those instances: 
a.	When necessary for the location of a structure or site improvement and when no feasible alternative location for the structure or improvements can be achieved without causing undue hardship; 
b.	The tree is dead, diseased, injured and in danger of falling, is too close to proposed or existing structures, interferes with existing utility services, interferes with safe vision clearances, or conflicts with other ordinances or regulations. 
Replacement of trees as provided in section 24-68 shall not apply to removals permitted under this paragraph. This exemption shall not be construed by affected property owners as an exemption from providing new plantings on the development site as a part of a landscaping plan which may be required by the planning commission in order to address the loss of trees or other vegetation due to construction activity. 
Replacement trees when required shall be provided as follows: 
1.	Tree replacement at 100 percent of trees removed will be required except in instances where the location of buildings, structures or grading are necessary to allow the development of the site and replacement of the trees cannot be accommodated on the site. 
2.	In instances where 100 percent tree replacement, is not feasible as provided in this section, the planning commission may allow reduction of the replacement trees to not less than 30 percent for industrial and business properties and not less than 50 percent replacement for residential properties. 
3.	Tree replacement as required shall be on the site in question; or, in lieu thereof, monies may be placed in escrow with the township at a fee established by the township for tree purchase and planting on public properties within the township. 
4.	Street trees required for subdivision may serve as a credit of 50 percent toward the number of replacement trees required. 
(5)	Where the removal or cutting of linkage strip, a portion of linkage strip, or any trees eight inches d.b.h. or greater is permitted, replacement trees shall be provided in accordance with section 24-68. 
(6)	The proposed activity shall include necessary provisions for tree protection in accordance with section 24-69. 
(7)	Where the proposed activity consists of land clearing, it shall be limited to designated street rights-of-way, drainage, and other utility areas, and areas necessary to the construction of proposed buildings and structures, as depicted on the plat or site plan. Where the proposed activity consists of grubbing, all trees with a d.b.h. of three inches or greater will be left undisturbed with the drip line understory left intact. 
(8)	Where the proposed activity includes residential development, residential units shall blend into the natural setting of the landscape for the enhancement of the sound, orderly, economic growth and development and for the protection of property values in this township. 
(9)	The proposed activity shall be in compliance with all other applicable statutes and ordinances. 
(10)	The burden of demonstrating that no feasible and prudent alternative location or improvements without undue hardship shall be upon the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 12, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-68. Relocation or replacement.
(a)	Whenever use permit allows the removal of trees of eight-inch d.b.h. or greater or shrubs within a linkage strip, said trees shall be relocated or replaced by the permit grantee. Such plant relocation or replacement shall be on a one-to-one ratio, provided that all replacement trees are of a two-inch caliper or greater. Shrubs should be at least two feet high. No credit shall be given for trees otherwise required pursuant to the landscaping requirements of the township zoning ordinance or the planned development district. 
(b)	All replacement trees shall satisfy American Association Nurseryman standards, and be: 
(1)	Nursery grown; 
(2)	State department of agriculture inspected; 
(3)	Tree spade transplanted while in the dormant state, or, if not in the dormant state, having been balled and burlapped with a solid well-laced root ball when in the dormant state; 
(4)	No. 1 grade, with a straight unscarred trunk and a well-developed uniform crown (park grade trees are unacceptable); 
(5)	Staked, fertilized, watered and mulched in accordance with standard planting practices; 
(6)	Guaranteed for one year, including labor, to remove and dispose of dead materials; 
(7)	Approved through inspection by the township; 
(8)	Of the same species as the removed plants where available from Michigan nurseries. Where plants of the same species are not available, replacement shall be made by recommendation of the planning commission and shall only consist of species within the forest association the woodland is composed of. 
(c)	The location of replacement trees shall be subject to the approval of the township, and shall be such as to provide the optimum enhancement, preservation and protection of woodland area. Where woodland densities permit, tree relocation or replacement shall be within the same woodland area as the removed plants. 
(d)	Where tree relocation or replacement is not feasible within the woodland area, or on the property where the activity is to be conducted, or on other approved property within the township, the permit grantee shall pay into the township tree fund monies for tree replacement in a per-tree amount representing the current market value for the tree replacement that would be utilized for the maintenance and preservation of woodland areas and the planting and maintenance of trees within the township. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 13, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-69. Tree protection during construction.
(a)	Before development, land clearing, filling or land alteration for which a use permit is required by this article commences, the developer shall be required to erect for the protection of remaining plants, barriers as approved by the township. Such protection shall remain in its approved location until such time as it is authorized to be removed by the township, or issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. During construction, no attachments or wires shall be attached to any of said trees so protected. Wood, metal, or other substantial material shall be utilized in the construction of barriers. Barriers will be required for all trees being protected, except in the following cases: 
(1)	Street right-of-way and utility easements may be ribboned by placing stakes a maximum, of 50 feet apart and tying ribbon, plastic tape, rope, etc., from stake along the outside perimeters of such areas to be cleared; and 
(2)	Large property areas separate from the construction or land clearing area into which no equipment will venture may also be ribboned off as above. 
(b)	It is unlawful for any person to conduct any activity within the drip line of any tree designated to be retained, including but not limited to the placing of any solvents, material, construction machinery, or soil within such drip line. 
(c)	The township may require the developer to also reasonably highlight those trees which are to be preserved during the course of construction, through such means as flagging, use of biodegradable paint or other form of designation determined by the township staff. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 14, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-70. Display permits.
The permit grantee shall prominently display on the site the permit issued. Such display shall be continuous while trees are being removed or replaced or while work authorized under the permit is being done, and for at least ten days after the completion thereof. Failure to allow entry for inspection by township representatives pursuant to the conditions attached to the permit shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 15, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-71. Taking without compensation.
(a)	This article shall not be construed to abrogate rights or authority otherwise protected by law. 
(b)	For the purposes of determining if there has been a taking of property without just compensation under Michigan law, an owner of property who has sought and has been denied a permit or has been made subject to modifications or conditions in the permit, under this article, may file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)	If the court determines that an action of the township pursuant to this article constitutes a taking of the property of a person, then the court shall order the township, at the township's option, to do one or more of the following: 
(1)	Compensate the property owner for the full amount of the lost value; 
(2)	Purchase the property in the public interest as determined before its value was affected by this article; 
(3)	Modify its action with respect to the property so as to minimize the detrimental effect to the property's value; and 
(4)	Modify its action with respect to the property so that the action will not constitute a taking of the property. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 16, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-72. Appeals.
If a person subject to regulation under this article disagrees with an official interpretation of a certain provision of this article, they may appeal the interpretation to the township board. The request for appeal shall be in letter form to the township board submitted to the attention of the township clerk. The township board shall consider the matter of the appeal at a regular scheduled board meeting. The township board may refer the matter to the planning commission for their review and recommendation. In any case, the decision of the township board shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 17, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-73. Interpretation and application.
In the interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum, requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, morals, safety, comfort, convenience, or general welfare. It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, annul, or in any way impair or interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance, or with any rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to the law relating to activities within woodland area; provided, however, that where this article imposes a greater restriction than is required by existing ordinance or by rules, regulations, or permits, the provisions of this article shall control. 
(Ord. No. 97-163, 18, 2-28-97)
 
Sec. 24-74. Violation; penalties; enforcement.
(a)	Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a municipal civil infraction, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $500.00 for each such violation. Each day upon which such violation occurs shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)	In addition to the penalties provided in this article, any person who violates any provision of this article shall forfeit and pay to the township a civil penalty equal to the total value of those trees illegally removed or damaged, as computed from the International Society of Arboriculture shade tree value formula. Such sum shall accrue to the township and may be recovered in a civil action brought by the township. Said sum so collected shall be placed in the township tree fund. Replacement of illegally removed trees may be required as restoration in lieu of money. This replacement will be computed on an inch-for-inch ratio based on the total diameter measured at d.b.h. in inches of the illegally removed trees. If, because of destruction of the removed trees, exact inch-to-inch measurements cannot be obtained, the township may use other means to estimate the tree loss. A combination of money and tree replacement may be required. 
(c)	Any use or activity in violation of the terms of this article is declared to be a nuisance per se, and may be abated by order of any court of competent jurisdiction. The township board in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, abate, or restrain the violation. All cost, fees, and expenses in connection with such action shall be assessed as damages against the violation. 
(d)	If activities are conducted in a woodlands area contrary to a use permit, this article or other applicable laws or ordinances, the township community development department shall given written notice to the permit grantee, or if a permit has not been issued, then to the person conducting the activity, notifying him/her of the violation of the permit, this article, or other applicable law or ordinance, and to appear and; show cause why the activity should not be stopped. If the permit grantee or the person conducting the activity fails to appear and show cause within one full work day after notice is delivered, the community development department shall cause a written order to stop the activity to be posted on the premises. A person shall not continue or cause or allow to be continued, activity in violation of such an order, except with permission of the enforcing agency to abate a dangerous condition or remove the violation, or except by court order. If an order to stop is not obeyed, the enforcing agency may apply to the circuit court of Washtenaw County for an order enjoining the violation of the order. This remedy is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy provided by law or ordinance, and does not prevent criminal prosecution for failure to obey the order. 
(e)	Any person violating the provisions of this article shall become liable to the township for any expense or loss or damage occasioned by the township by reason of such violation.

ARTICLE IV. TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY
Editor's note(s)âOrd. No. 2005-359, adopted on Aug. 16, 2005, was included herein as superceding article IV. See also the Code Comparative Table. 
 
DIVISION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
 
Sec. 24-96. Short title.
This article shall be known and may be designated as the "Township of Ypsilanti Traffic Impact Analysis Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2005-359, 8-16-05)
 
Sec. 24-97. Purpose.
The Charter Township of Ypsilanti recognizes the direct correlation between land use decisions and the resultant impact on traffic operations and safety. The intent of this article is to describe situations where traffic impact information must be provided and evaluated as part of the decision-making process. This article is further intended to help achieve the following objectives: 
A.	Ensure land use decisions are made with consideration to the findings and recommendations in the thoroughfare plan chapter of the township's comprehensive plan. 
B.	Establish thresholds for submittal of various types of traffic impact studies and a procedure for preparation and review based on accepted traffic engineering procedures and guidelines in the Michigan Handbook "Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies". 
C.	Allow the community to assess the traffic impacts a proposed project may have on the community and possible changes to the development proposal or improvements to the roadway system to lessen that impact. 
D.	Promote consistency with the goal that signalized intersections operate at a Level of Service C or better and un-signalized at D or better throughout the township. 
E.	Help ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on streets and intersections after development of proposed use. 
F.	Provide direction to community decision-makers, road agencies and developers of expected impacts of a project. 
G.	Alert the community, transportation agencies, and developers of improvements or modification needed to the roadway, access or site design. 
H.	Protect the substantial public investment in the existing street system. 
I.	Help ensure safe and reasonable traffic operation conditions on roads and intersections and protect the public health, safety, and welfare, which can be damaged by unmanaged increases in traffic congestion. 
(Ord. No. 2005-359, 8-16-05)
 
DIVISION 2. DEFINITIONS
 
Sec. 24-98. Definitions.
The following terms used in this article shall be defined as follows: 
Development: A site plan, subdivision tentative preliminary plat, condominium project, mobile home park, redevelopment, reuse or expansion of a use or building. 
Average day: A Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday for most uses. The average day may be a Saturday for uses that have higher peak-hour traffic volumes on a Saturday rather than mid-week. 
Background traffic: Traffic anticipated to occur regardless of the decision on the subject application based on overall trends as demonstrated by, annual traffic increases and associated with specific approved projects for the opening year of a project. Data such as historic counts and long-range traffic projections from the UATS model shall be considered as part of the background traffic calculation. 
Gap (critical): The median time headway (in seconds) between vehicles in a major traffic stream which will permit side-street vehicles at STOP or YIELD controlled approach to cross through or merge with the major traffic stream under prevailing traffic and roadway conditions. 
Level of service: A qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream; generally described in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, delay, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience and safety. 
(a)	Level of Service A: Operations with very low control delay occurring with favorable progression and/or short cycle lengths. 
(b)	Level of Service B: Operations with low control delay occurring with good progression and/or short cycle lengths. 
(c)	Level of Service C: Operations with average control delays resulting from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures begin to appear. Typically determined to be acceptable for signalized intersections. 
(d)	Level of Service D: Operations with longer control delays due to a combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high V/C ratios. Many vehicles stop and individual cycle failures are noticeable. Typically determined to be acceptable for un-signalized intersections. 
Comprehensive plan: The plan adopted by the Ypsilanti Township Planning Commission which illustrates the intended future land use pattern, includes the master thoroughfare plan and may also described roadway functional classifications and intended improvements to the transportation system (i.e. master plan, future land use plan, thoroughfare plan, etc.). 
Peak hour: A one hour period representing the highest hourly volume of traffic flow in the adjacent street system during the morning (a.m. peak hour), during the afternoon or evening (p.m. peak hour); or representing the hour of highest volume of traffic entering or exiting a site (peak hour of generator). 
Study area: The geographic area containing those critical arterial intersections (and connecting roadway segments) which are expected to be affected by the site-traffic generated by a development. 
Trip (i.e. directional trip): A single or one direction vehicle movement with either the origin of the destination (exiting or entering) inside a study site. 
(Ord. No. 2005-359, 8-16-05)
 
DIVISION 3. APPLICABILITY AND SUBMITTAL INFORMATION
 
Sec. 24-99. Applicability and types of studies.
The following traffic impact analysis shall be required at the preliminary review stage for any site plan, special conditional use, condominium project, subdivision plat or rezoning. The process for reviews are set forth in the Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations. The level of detail required is based on the expected amount of traffic to be generated by the proposed use, based on generally accepted traffic engineering sources as described herein and the Michigan handbook "Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies." 
(a)	Traffic impact comparison. A comparison of the number of trips expected to be generated during the a.m. peak hour, p.m. peak hour and on a typical weekday for any existing use of the subject site, representative uses permitted under current zoning and representative uses permitted under the requested zoning. For projects where the comparison yields a difference greater than 50 directional trips during a peak hour or 500 trips on a typical weekday, a traffic impact assessment shall be performed. 
(b)	Traffic impact assessment. An analysis that evaluates current and future inbound and outbound traffic operations at site access points shall be required for projects expected to generate either 50â99 directional trips during a peak hour or 500â750 trips during a typical day. 
(c)	Traffic impact study. An analysis that evaluates current, background, and future traffic operations at site access points and major signalized or non-signalized intersections in proximity to the site shall be required for any proposed development which would be expected to generate over 100 directional trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour on the adjacent streets, or over 750 trips in an average day. Intersections to be evaluated in the traffic impact statement shall be established by the township. 
(d)	Updates. A traffic impact study or assessment shall also be required for new phases, expansions or changes to a development that requires site plan review, based on the thresholds established above, except where such report was approved (date of site plan approval) within two years of the new site plan submittal date, and a demonstration by the applicant's traffic engineer that traffic volumes have not increased by over two (2) percent annually. 
(Ord. No. 2005-359, 8-16-05)
 
Sec. 24-100. Required contents.
The following information is required for both traffic impact assessments and traffic impact studies unless otherwise specified: 
(a)	Existing site conditions. Illustrations and a narrative which describes the characteristics of the site and adjacent roadway system (planned and existing right-of-way, functional classification, lane configuration, speed limits, any sight distances limitations, locations and potential conflicts with operations at existing access points or intersections within 250 feet of the site's frontage, current traffic conflicts, etc.). This description should include surrounding land uses, expected development in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site features and a description of any committed roadway improvements. The study should define and justify the study area selected for analysis. 
(b)	Existing traffic conditions. Illustrations, narratives, tables and capacity analysis that reflects existing traffic conditions including: 
(1)	Roadway alignment, including any problems with sight distance, number of lanes, lane width and lane configurations; 
(2)	Posted speed limits for various segments; 
(3)	Existing traffic control; 
(4)	Existing signal timing, as applicable; 
(5)	Existing peak-hour weekday traffic volumes (and daily volumes or peak period counts (7â9 a.m.â4â6 p.m.) to support the selection of the evaluated peak hour (if applicable) on street(s) adjacent to the site. For uses with weekend peak characteristics, the township may require new counts be taken on typical weekend days during the anticipated peak hours of the proposed use. All counts shall be collected using accepted practices and shall not be over two (2) years old; 
(6)	For projects that require a traffic impact study, existing counts and levels of service for intersections in the study area shall be performed; and 
(7)	For a traffic impact study, crash data shall be provided and analyzed for the most recent three (3) year period upon which information is available for sites in close proximity to intersections identified in the township's comprehensive plan as either a "critical crash location" or a "fatality" location, for projects that generate 500 or more peak hour trips. SEMCOG data or UD-10 reports should be used in the analysis. Critical crash locations should be identified using SEMCOG's critical crash thresholds. The township's traffic engineer may waive this requirement upon a finding that the crash potential would not be significantly impacted by the proposed project. Crash data shall also be obtained and analyzed if a signal warrant analysis must be preformed where existing or projected level of service is D or worse for un-signalized intersections. The signal warrant analysis should contain, at a minimum, Warrants 1, 2, 6, 9, and 11. 
(c)	Background traffic conditions. Projects that are not expected to be completed and occupied within one year of site plan approval shall provide a separate evaluation of background traffic for the expected completion date of the proposed development. This background traffic shall be based on historic counts to acknowledge general growth trends in the area, plus traffic associated with approved developments either currently under construction or approved (and would be operational before the build out year of this proposed project), in the project area. The background traffic shall be evaluated based on the existing road system plus programmed improvements where funding has been committed. A level of service analysis shall be preformed for each intersection in the study area. No unfunded mitigation shall be provided under the background conditions. Background traffic turning movements shall be illustrated in the report. 
(d)	Proposed use or future conditions. For a site plan review, mobile home park, condominium project, a subdivision plat, planned development, or special conditional use: a description of factors that relate to project trip generation such as the number and types of dwelling units, the gross and usable floor area, the number of employees and shift change factors shall be provided. Intended phasing or future expansion shall be noted. For a rezoning, a description of the potential representative uses which would be allowed, compared to representative uses allowed under current zoning. Representative uses shall include the most intense traffic generation use allowed under current zoning in compliance with all township site development regulations. 
(e)	Trip generation forecast. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m. peak hour, the p.m. peak hour and average day shall be provided for the overall project and each phase. The forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined in the most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant may use other commonly accepted and published sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from at least three (3) similar projects in Michigan. 
(f)	Trip reduction. Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ride-sharing, other modes and internal capture rates shall be based both on ITE findings and documented survey results acceptable to the township and applicable road agency. The township may elect to reduce the trip reduction rates used. 
(g)	Trip distribution. The projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound v. outbound, left turn v. right turn) onto the existing street network to project turning movements at site access points, and nearby intersections where required. Projected turning movements shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the application of standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution should be provided such as trip distribution model, market studies or counts at existing driveways. 
(h)	Access point level of service. A level of service or "capacity" analysis is required at the proposed access points using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board. The capacity analysis should be provided in the appendix of the report.

(Code 1975, Â§ 8Â½-1)
 
Sec. 34-27. Findings of fact.
(a)	The flood hazard areas of the township are subject to periodic inundation which could result in potential loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which would adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These potential flood loses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
(Code 1975, Â§ 8Â½-2)
 
Sec. 34-28. Statement of purpose of article.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1975, Â§ 8Â½-3)
 
Sec. 34-29. Objectives of article.
The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)	Protect human life and health; 
(2)	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)	Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)	Provide a means whereby potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article. 
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

Where daily maximum limitations are expressed in terms of a concentration, the daily discharge is the arithmetical average measurement of the pollutant concentration derived from all measurements taken that day. Where daily maximum limitations are expressed in units of mass, the daily discharge is the total mass discharged during the day. If a composite sample is required for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded on a single calendar day shall be based on the composite sample collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If grab samples are required for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded on a calendar day shall be based on the average of all grab samples collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If only one grab sample is collected for a parameter on a given day, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded for the day shall be based on the results of that single grab sample. If the pollutant concentration in any sample is less than the applicable detection limit, that value shall be regarded as zero when calculating the daily maximum concentration.

Where the provisions of 40 C.F.R. Part 136 (March 26, 2007) do not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the E.P.A. determines that the Part 136 (March 26, 2007) sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the YCUA or other parties and approved by the E.P.A. 
(5)	If a nondomestic user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the YCUA using the procedures prescribed in subsection (4) immediately above, the results of the monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(6)	A minimum of one grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples shall be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques. The YCUA may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any nondomestic user that demonstrates that time-proportional sampling is representative of the discharge during the sampling period. Samples obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples may be approved by the director or designee when the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
(f)	The YCUA may require appropriate reporting from nondomestic users that have discharges, which are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Significant industrial users shall submit, to the YCUA, at least semiannually, a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the YCUA. The reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 (March 26, 2007). Where the provisions of 40 C.F.R. Part 136 (March 26, 2007) do not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the E.P.A. determines that the Part 136 (March 26, 2007) sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the YCUA or other persons and approved by the E.P.A. The sampling and analysis may be performed by the YCUA instead of the significant industrial user. Where the YCUA collects all of the information required for the report, the significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report. The YCUA shall provide, to the nondomestic user, within ten days after the results are available, the results of any sampling it performs for nondomestic user self-monitoring that show a violation of any pretreatment standard.

Sec. 62-133. Enforcement process.
(a)	Emergency suspension. The director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or any permit issued under this article when such a suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the director, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, the POTW, or constitutes a violation of any condition of a NPDES or other permit, this article, the Act or State Act. Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment services or a permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge into a township or YCUA sanitary sewer. If a user fails to immediately comply with such a suspension order and as required in this section, the YCUA shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate termination or severance of the user's sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to any person, the POTW or the environment. The YCUA shall allow the user to recommence its discharge upon receipt of proof of compliance with this article and the elimination of the discharge and/or identified danger. A user whose wastewater treatment service or permit has been suspended under this article shall submit, within 15 days of the suspension, a written statement to the director describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent future harmful discharges in addition to other information required by this article or otherwise required by the Act or State Act under such circumstances. 
(b)	Notice letter. The minimum enforcement response that the director or his/her designee will use to notify a user that a violation of the local applicable sewer use ordinance or YCUA industrial pretreatment program has occurred or is occurring. 
(c)	Notification of violation. Whenever the director finds that any user has violated or is violating any provision of this article or a wastewater discharge permit, an order issued under this article, the Act or State Act, the director may serve upon said user written notice of the violation. Within 30 days of receipt of such notice the user shall submit to the director or designee an explanation of the violation and a written plan for satisfactory correction. Submission of this plan does not relieve the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation or as otherwise provided in this article, the Act or State Act. 
(d)	Show cause order. The director may order any user violating this article or the IPP permit, an order issued under this article, the Act, or State Act, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The show cause notice shall require the user to appear before the director for a show cause meeting within a reasonable time, not less than ten days after first class mailing of the order to the user's recorded or last known address. Enforcement action may be pursued whether or not a user appears at a show cause meeting and issuance of a show cause order does not relieve the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice or as otherwise provided in this article, the Act, or State Act. 
(e)	Consent order. The director is empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance and other similar documented agreements establishing an agreement with a user responsible for noncompliance with an order, permit, this article, the Act or State Act. Such a document may include compliance schedules, stipulated fines or penalties, the amount of which shall not be limited by the civil fine assessment provision of this article, remedial actions and signatures of the director and user. Consent orders or similar documented agreements prepared and executed under this section shall have the same force and effect as other orders issued under this article. 
(f)	Compliance order. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, a permit, an order issued under this article, the Act or State Act, an order may be issued to the user directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated and compliance is otherwise achieved. Such an order may contain other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the installation of pre-treatment technology, additional self-monitoring and new management practices. Issuance of a compliance order does not relieve the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice or as otherwise provided in this article, the Act or State Act. 
(g)	Cease and desist order. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, a permit, an order issued under this article, the Act or State Act, an order may be issued to the user responsible for the violation directing that such violations cease and desist immediately. In an emergency, the order to cease and desist may be given by telephone. In a nonemergency situation, the cease and desist order may be used to suspend or permanently revoke an industrial wastewater discharge permit or permits. A cease and desist order may require the user to take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order does not relieve the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the order or as otherwise provided in this article. 
(h)	Termination of wastewater discharge permit. Any user who has a permit who violates the following conditions of a wastewater discharge permit or violates this article, the Act or State Act or any applicable state or federal law or regulation is subject to permit termination: 
(1)	Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents and characteristics;

Sec. 62-179. Prohibited discharges.
No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will pass through or interfere with the operation or performance of the sewage works. 
A user may not contribute the following substances to the sewage works: 
(1)	Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the sewage works or to the operation of the sewage works. 
(2)	Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities. 
(3)	Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 11.0; or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, or personnel of the sewage works. 
(4)	Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants or of high chlorine demand in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the sewage works, or exceed the limitation set forth in the EPA categorical pretreatment standard, or any other federal, state or county standards. 
(5)	Pollutants that result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause worker health and safety problems. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, wastewaters which contain liquids, solids, or gases that cause gases, vapors, or fumes from the discharge to exceed ten percent of the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) concentration. Discharges which contain more than one pollutant which may contribute to fume toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive limitations, as determined necessary by the director. The more restrictive discharge limits shall be calculated based on the additive fume toxicity of all compounds identified or reasonably expected to be present in the discharge. 
(6)	Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(7)	Any substance, which may cause the sewage, works such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for land application or reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. 
(8)	Any substance, which will cause the sewage, works to violate its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
(9)	Any wastewater with color of sufficient light absorbency to interfere with treatment plant process, prevent analytical determinations, or create any aesthetic effect on the treatment plant effluent, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(10)	Daily maximum concentration or mass loading shall not be exceeded on any single calendar day. Where daily maximum limitations are expressed in terms of a concentration, the daily discharge is the arithmetical measurement of the pollutant concentration derived from all measurements taken that day. Where daily maximum limitations are expressed in units of mass, the daily discharge is the total mass discharged during the day. If a composite sample is required for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded on a single calendar day shall be based on the composite sample collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If grab samples are required for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded on a calendar day shall be based on the average of all grab samples collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If only one grab sample is collected for a parameter on a given day, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded for the day shall be based on the results of that single grab sample. If the pollutant concentration in any sample is less than the applicable detection limit, that value shall be regarded as zero when calculating the daily maximum concentration. 
(11)	Any wastewater having a temperature, which will inhibit biological activity in the sewage, works resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the sewage works, which exceeds 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) or is lower than zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). 
(12)	Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by applicable state or federal regulations. 
(13)	Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
(14)	Organic solvent extractable substances such as fats, wax, grease, or oils of petroleum origin, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius) and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). 
(15)	Gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or explosive liquids, solids or gases; or other pollutants which cause the wastewater to have a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), or which cause an exceedance of ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) at any point within the collection system or containing gasoline, benzene, xylene or toluene which causes the wastewater to exceed the state surface water quality standard. 
(16)	Any garbage that has not been ground by household type or other suitable garbage grinders. 
(17)	Any ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, paunch, manure or any other solids or viscous substances capable of causing obstructions or other interferences with the proper operation of the sewer system.

Nondetectable polychlorinated biphenyls (nondetectable per U.S. EPA Method 608. Any detectable sample exceeds this limit). The local discharge limitation for polychlorinated biphenyls is established at the level of detection in accordance with the following: 
There shall be no detectable amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls discharged to a township or YCUA sanitary sewer. Polychlorinated biphenyls sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring shall be in accordance with EPA Method 608. The level of detection, developed in accordance with the procedure specified in 40 CFR 136, shall not exceed 0.2 ug/L for polychlorinated biphenyls, unless higher levels are appropriate due to matrix interference. 
(4)	The total phenols limit is based on the discharge of any or all of the following phenolic compounds: 2 - Chlorophenol, 4 - Chlorophenol, 2, 4 - Dichlorophenol, 2, 4 - Dimethylphenol, 2, 4 - Dinitrophenol, 2 - Methyphenol, 3 - Methylphenol, 4 - Methylphenol, 2 - Nitrophenol, 4 - Nitrophenol, and Phenol. Discharge of other phenolic compounds is prohibited except as specifically authorized by the director. 
(5)	The director shall annually review the quantities of industrial pollutants listed above which are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the sewage works. The director shall recommend any revisions to these limits necessary to insure that the NPDES permit, Federal Pretreatment Standards and water resources limits are met and to insure that the industrial discharge will not interfere with the treatment process of sludge disposal. At such time as the previously cited limits are changed by the township or YCUA, the unit authorizing such change shall notify the remaining units of such change. 
(6)	The local discharge limitation for mercury is established at the level of detection in accordance with the following: 
(a)	There shall be no detectable amounts of mercury discharged to a township or YCUA sanitary sewer. Mercury sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring shall be in accordance with EPA Method 245.1. The level of detection, developed in accordance with the procedure specified in 40 CFR 136, shall not exceed 0.2 ug/L for mercury, unless higher levels are appropriate due to matrix interference. 
(b)	The evaluation of potential matrix interference(s) shall include, at a minimum, the following: 
i.	A demonstration that the laboratory conducting the analysis is capable of achieving the level of detection of 0.2 ug/L in reagent water; 
ii.	A demonstration that the level of detection of 0.2 ug/L cannot be achieved in the effluent; and 
iii.	A demonstration that an attempt has been made to resolve the matrix interference(s). 
(c)	In cases where true matrix interference(s) can be demonstrated, a discharge-specific level of detection will be developed in accordance with the procedure in 40 CFR 136. Discharge specific levels of detection will be incorporated into the wastewater discharge permit of the nondomestic user. 
(d)	To ensure that the maximum allowable mercury loading to the POTW is not exceeded, YCUA may require any nondomestic user with a reasonable potential to discharge mercury to develop, submit for approval and implement a mercury reduction plan (MRP). The MRP may be required by permit if the nondomestic user has not violated the local limit for mercury, but YCUA has determined that a reasonable potential for such violation may exist. MRPs may be required in notices of violations, orders or other enforcement actions when the nondomestic user has violated the mercury local limit. 
At a minimum, an approvable MRP shall contain the following: 
i.	A written commitment by the nondomestic user to reduce all nondomestic discharges of mercury to levels below the level of detection within three years of the MRP's original approval date; 
ii.	Within 60 days of notification by YCUA that a MRP is required, the nondomestic user shall supply an initial identification of all potential sources of mercury which could be discharged to the sanitary sewer system; 
iii.	Specific strategies for mercury reduction with reasonable time frames for implementation, capable of ensuring that mercury discharges will be below the specified level of detection within three years; 
iv.	A program for quarterly sampling and analysis of the nondomestic discharge for mercury in accordance with EPA Method 245.1; 
v.	A demonstration of specific, measurable and/or otherwise quantifiable mercury reductions consistent with the goal of reducing mercury discharges below the specified level of detection. Where such reductions cannot be demonstrated through normal effluent monitoring (e.g., mercury discharges are already near level of detection), the demonstration should incorporate the following: 
a.	Internal process monitoring, documenting the results of mercury reduction strategies at sampling locations within the facility (e.g., a program of regular monitoring of sink traps where mercury containing reagents had previously been disposed, but have since been substituted by non-Mercury containing compounds). 
b.	Internal and/or effluent sampling utilizing clean and/or ultra-clean sampling and analytical methods as referenced by EPA Federal Register. The results of such monitoring will not be used for compliance purposes unless performed in accordance with EPA Method 245.1 and collected at the appropriate compliance measurement location. 
c.	Loading calculations wherein the nondomestic user calculates the total mass of mercury reduced from the sanitary sewer discharge through reagent substitutions, changes in disposal practices and/or other approved MRP strategies implemented. 
vi.	A semi-annual report on the status of the mercury reduction efforts. At a minimum, these reports shall: Identify compliance or noncompliance with specific reduction commitments in the MRP; summarize the analytical, mass-based or other quantifiable demonstrations of mercury reductions performed to date; provide all applicable analytical data; provide an evaluation of effectiveness of actions taken to date; provide updates to the initial list of mercury containing compounds discharged to the sanitary sewer and propose for approval new strategies and/or modifications to the current MRP to continue and improve mercury reduction efforts; and 
vii.	Any other conditions that YCUA deems necessary to ensure that mercury-reduction efforts are effective in achieving the goals of this section. 
(e)	Failure to submit an approvable MRP within 30 days of the required due date shall constitute significant noncompliance in accordance with this section, and will result in publication as a significant violator. 
(f)	A MRP may be evaluated for adequacy at any time by YCUA. If such an evaluation determines that the mercury reduction plan is in adequate or the nondomestic user has not complied with its approved MRP, the nondomestic user will be notified. Failure to comply with the MRP requirement constitutes noncompliance. YCUA will follow its enforcement response plan (ERP) to ensure that corrective actions are taken. 
(g)	A nondomestic user may request a release from MRP requirements if all samples of the discharge for a period of one year are less than the specified level of detection; the nondomestic user has complied with the minimum monitoring frequency of quarterly sampling events; and YCUA deems that MRP commitments have been fulfilled sufficiently to ensure continued compliance with the mercury limitation. YCUA shall notify the nondomestic user of any release from MRP requirements in writing. 
(h)	If the MRP requirement is waived by YCUA, the nondomestic user remains subject to the local limitation for mercury in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
(i)	Rediscovery of mercury in the nondomestic user discharge subjects said user to the submission of a new MRP, or escalation of enforcement in accordance with the ERP. 
(7)	Implementation of best management practices or best management practices plan. 
(a)	The director may require any user to develop and implement best management practices (BMP) to control, contain, treat, prevent, or reduce the discharge of wastewater, pollutants, or other substances from the user's premises to the POTW, as determined necessary by the director. 
(b)	In addition, the director may require a user to develop and submit a best management practices plan ("BMPP"), including an enforceable implementation schedule, for review and approval by the director. The BMPP shall be submitted within 30 days after notification by the director or as otherwise required by a user permit. The BMPP shall be directed at preventing the entrance of pollutants, directly or indirectly, into the POTW . The BMPP shall be available for inspection at all times at the user's premises. At a minimum, a user's BMPP shall contain all of the following elements, as determined necessary by the director, at a level of detail and in units and terms as determined necessary by the director to adequately evaluate the plan: 
i.	A statement of the purpose and objectives of the plan. 
ii.	A description of the strategies, methods, policies and procedures to prevent, minimize or reduce the introduction of pollutants into the user's discharge and to minimize waste generation. 
iii.	A description of the options available to the user to control accidental spillage, leaks and drainage. 
iv.	A description of best available or practicable control technologies available for the user's specific circumstances. 
v.	A detailed facility layout and site diagram showing points of entry into the (POTWs). 
vi.	A description of the waste handling, treatment and discharge disposal facilities, including flow diagrams and process schematics. 
vii.	A description of operating and maintenance processes and procedures. 
viii.	An inventory of raw materials and a list of waste sources, including a list of all chemicals used or stored at the facility. 
ix.	A description of employee training programs, policies and procedures; continuing education programs; and participation.

xiv.	Such other information, documents or diagrams as required by the director, including, but not limited to, any of the information required under this article, the Act, or State Law. 
(c)	The BMPs or BMPP required of a user or approved for a user shall be incorporated in a user permit issued to the user. If the user already has a user permit, the existing permit shall be modified to incorporate the BMP requirements. If the user does not currently have a user permit, a permit shall be issued for that purpose. 
(d)	The director may require revisions to a user's BMPP if the director determines that the plan contains elements that are inadequate, or as otherwise determined necessary by the director to ensure compliance with applicable requirements of this article, the Act or State Law. Review of a BMPP by the director shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to comply with this article, the Act or State Law. 
(e)	The user reports to the director must include best management practices compliance information. The user reports must be certified and signed by the user's authorized representative. 
(f)	The user shall retain all documentation associated with best management practices for a period of at least three years from the date of an activity associated with the practices. This period may be extended by the Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority at any time. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-182. Sampling, measurements, tests and analyses.
Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 (March 26, 2007). Where 40 CFR Part 136 (March 26, 2007) does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 (March 26, 2007) sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by YCUA or other parties, approved by the EPA. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-183. Surcharge for discharges of unusual strength.
(a)	If the character of the wastewater from any manufacturing or industrial plant or any other building or premises exceeds the limits for compatible pollutants established in section 62-181 or shall be such as to impose any unreasonable burden upon the sewers of the system or upon the sewage works or POTW in excess of a maximum limit prescribed in this article, then an additional charge shall be made over and above the regular rates, or the director shall require that such sewage be treated by the person, firm or corporation responsible for the sewage being emptied into the sewer or the right to empty such sewage shall be denied, if necessary, to protect the system or any part thereof. Surcharges required shall be computed as the weight of excess compatible pollutant in pounds multiplied by the cost per pound specified in the applicable township rate ordinance. The strength of such wastes shall be determined by composite samples taken over a sufficient period of time to insure a representative sample. The cost of sampling and testing shall be borne by the industry or establishment, whether owner or lessee. Tests shall be made by the user, at an independent laboratory, or at the YCUA wastewater treatment plant. 
(b)	Any wastewater discharged into the sewage works having a compatible pollutant in excess of those prescribed in section 62-181 may be permitted by the director provided payment by the industrial concern for the full cost of treating such excess constituents in the wastewater is made and acceptance of the waste does not cause violation of EPA guidelines, NPDES requirements, the Act or State Act. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-184. Special agreements authorized.
With respect to compatible pollutants only, no statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any agreement between the director and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted, subject to payment therefore by the industrial concern, provided such agreement shall not violate EPA guidelines or NPDES requirements and provided user charges and surcharges as provided in this article are agreed to in the agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-185. Dilution of discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, alternative discharge limits, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the YCUA or the state. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-186. Accidental discharges.
(a)	Where required, a user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article, the Act or State Act. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be approved by the director before construction of the facility. All required users shall complete such a program within 90 days of notification by the director. If required by the director a user who commences contribution to the sewage works after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the director. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article, the Act or State Act. In the case of any discharge, whether accidental or not, that could cause problems to the YCUA, the WWTP or POTW, including any slug loadings by the user, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the YCUA of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(b)	Within five days following any discharge, whether accidental or not, that could cause problems to the YCUA, the WWTP or POTW, including any slug loadings by the user, the user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewage works or POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article, the Act or State Act, or other applicable law. Failure to file a report shall be a separate violation of this article. 
(c)	Slug control plan. 
(1)	Each significant industrial user shall prepare and implement an individualized slug control plan when in the opinion of the director a slug control is required. Existing significant industrial users that do not have a YCUA-approved slug control plan shall provide an approvable slug control plan to the director within 90 days of being notified by YCUA that a slug control plan is required. New sources that are significant industrial users shall submit a slug control plan to the director for approval before beginning to discharge. Upon written notice from the director, users that are not significant industrial users may also be required to prepare and implement a slug control plan, and the plan shall be submitted to the director for approval as specified in the notice. Slug control requirements must be included in the SIU control mechanism (industrial user's permit). 
(2)	All slug control plans shall contain at least the following elements: 
a.	A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
b.	A description of stored chemicals; 
c.	The procedures for immediately notifying the director of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate any discharge prohibition, limitation or requirement under this article, and procedures for follow-up written notification within five days of the discharge; 
d.	The procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(3)	If a user has submitted to the director plans or documents pursuant to other requirements of local, state or federal laws and regulations which meet all applicable requirements of the article, the director may in its discretion determine that the user has satisfied the slug plan submission requirements of this section. 
(4)	Significant industrial users must immediately notify the director of any changes at their facilities affecting their slug control plan or spill/slug potential. 
(d)	Secondary containment requirements. 
(1)	Each user when in the opinion of the director is required must provide and maintain at the user's sole expense secondary spill containment structures (including diking, curbing or other appropriate structures) adequate to protect all floor drains from accidental spills and discharges to the POTW of any pollutants or discharges regulated by this article, the Act or State Law. 
a.	The containment area shall be constructed so that no liquid polluting material can escape from the area by gravity through the building sewers, drains, or otherwise directly or indirectly into the POTW. 
b.	The containment or curbing shall be sufficient to hold not less than ten percent of the total volume of the tanks or containers within the secondary containment structure or provide a capacity of 100 percent of the largest single tank or container within the secondary containment structure, whichever is larger, unless a lesser containment area or alternate control measures are approved in advance by the director. 
c.	The containment structure must accommodate "squirt distance." Containers within the containment structure must be able to be placed sufficiently back from the edge of the structure so if punctured, the resulting leak will be contained. 
d.	The containment structure must be designed or operated to prevent run-on or infiltration, rain or other liquids into the secondary containment system unless the containment system has sufficient excess capacity to contain run-on, infiltration, rain, or other liquids. Excess capacity when such prevention is not provided in the system must be sufficient to contain rain precipitation from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
e.	The containment structure shall be constructed with chemical-resistant water stops in place at all joints (if any) to be free of cracks or gaps. 
f.	The containment structure shall be designed and installed to completely surround the tank or containers and to cover all surrounding earth likely to come into contact with the waste if released from the tank(s) or containers (i.e., capable of preventing lateral as well as vertical migration of the material). 
g.	All floor drains found within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. 
(2)	Spill troughs and sumps within process areas must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks. 
(3)	Emergency containment shall also be provided for storage tanks that may be serviced by commercial haulers and for chemical storage areas. 
(4)	Solid pollutants shall be located in security areas designed to prevent the loss of the materials to the POTW. 
(5)	Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide the protection required by this article shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be approved by the director before construction. Construction of approved containment for existing sources shall be completed within the time period specified by the director. 
(6)	No new source shall be permitted to discharge to the POTW until emergency containment facilities have been approved and constructed as required by this article. 
(7)	The director may order a user to take interim measures for emergency containment as determined necessary by the director under the circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-187. Determination of sewage flow.
To determine the sewage flow from any establishment, the YCUA may use one of the following methods: 
(1)	The amount of water supplied to the premises by the public water system as shown upon the water meter if the premises are metered. 
(2)	If the premises are supplied with river water or water from private wells, the amount of water supplied from such sources may be metered at the source or metered at its point of discharge prior to entry into the public sewer. 
(3)	If such premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such a nature that the water supplied to the premises cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system, the estimate of the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system made by the utilities authority from the water, gas or electric supply, or metered at its point of discharge prior to entry into the public sewer. 
(4)	The volume of sewage discharged into the sewer system as determined by measurements and samples taken at a manhole installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer system at his own expense in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit issued by the YCUA pursuant to this article. 
(5)	A figure determined by the YCUA by any combination of the foregoing or by any other equitable method.

Sec. 62-188. Disposal at sewage treatment plant.
Waste from industrial sewage disposal systems shall be disposed of at the sewage treatment plant or at any other refuse or disposal site approved by the director. No waters or wastes described in section 62-179 shall be disposed of at the sewage treatment plant. 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-189. Bypass.
(a)	An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the director within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(b)	Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for bypass, unless: 
(1)	Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(3)	the industrial user submitted notice as required under this section. The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection (b). 
(Ord. No. 2010-406, 7-20-10)
 
Sec. 62-190. Report of violation.
If the results of any sampling performed by the user indicates that any violation of this article, a permit, an order issued under this article, the Act or State Act has occurred, the user shall notify the YCUA within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation and shall repeat the sampling and pollutant analysis and shall submit, in writing, the results of this repeat analysis within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. A written follow up report shall be filed by the user with the YCUA within 30 days of a user becoming aware of the violation. The report shall specify the following: 
(1)	A description of the violation, the cause thereof, and the violation's impact on the user's compliance status. 
(2)	Duration of the violation, including exact dates and times of the violation, and if not corrected, the anticipated time the violation is expected to continue. 
(3)	All steps taken or intended to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of such a violation.

(Ord. No. 2009-392, 7-21-09, eff. 12-1-09)
 
Sec. 66-72. Purpose.
(1)	The township board of trustees finds that certain compounds containing phosphorus, which are contained in manufactured fertilizer, when used in the township, enter into the township's and neighboring communities' water resources, including wetlands and watercourses, resulting in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants which is detrimental to these resources. 
(2)	The township board of trustees finds that reduction of the use of manufactured fertilizers containing phosphorus will assist the township in reducing the amount of phosphorus that enters the township's and neighboring communities' water resources as required by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) limitation for the Middle Huron River and associated tributaries and related National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit limits pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended and the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Water Quality Planning and Management Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 130), as amended. 
(3)	The township board of trustees finds that most mature topsoil in the township has a sufficient level of phosphorus, which occurs naturally to promote adequate turf root growth. 
(4)	It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate the use and application of manufactured fertilizers only on turf areas and not on or in areas such as gardens, farms, or landscape amenities.

ARTICLE XI-A. ECORSE ROAD FORM BASED DISTRICT (ERFB) 
 
Sec. 1140. General intent and purpose:
A.	Intent. The Ecorse Road form based district (ERFB) is intended to implement the vision established by the township master plan and the E. Michigan Avenue and Ecorse Road placemaking plan, to transform the Ecorse Road corridor into a vibrant, dynamic area through placemaking and the attraction of new investment. The Ecorse Road form based district allows for the consolidation and creative redevelopment of parcels. 
Development of buildings and sites, including retrofitting and redevelopment of existing sites and buildings, can include residential, retail, office, and service uses. Uses designed to support the residents and local workers are also encouraged, such as mixed-use developments with small scale retail or restaurant uses incorporated with housing units. The redeveloped corridor will help diversify the township housing and commercial stock and incorporate architecturally interesting buildings. 
Consolidation of parcels in the district is encouraged in order to provide for a quality and consistent development pattern. Incentives include additional building forms and more permitted uses. 
B.	Purpose. The general purpose of these regulations is as follows: 
a.	Promote new investment opportunities by allowing a wide range of potential uses and techniques to expand the employment and economic base. 
b.	Ensure that development is of human scale, primarily pedestrian-oriented, and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces. 
c.	Ensure that development is designed for all modes of transportation. 
d.	Promote mixed-use development. 
e.	Ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods. 
f.	Improve mobility options and reduce the need for on-site parking by encouraging all modes of transportation, through shared parking, and through on-street parking. 
g.	Provide predictable development approval process. 
h.	Encourage lot consolidation to provide for larger consistent developable sites. 
C.	Factors for regulation. These regulations are based on two significant factors: site context and building features. 
1.	Site context is derived from existing and desired characteristics of an area and recognizes the inherent conditions of the areas where these regulations are applied. Regulated sites types are organized by shape, size, orientation and location. 
2.	Building feature addresses the manner in which buildings and structures relate to their lots, surrounding buildings, and street frontage. The shape of the building, the land area to volume ratio, and the orientation of the building has a significant impact upon the character of an area. Building form standards control height, placement, building configuration, parking location, and building transparency applicable to the site context. 
( Ord. No. 2019-487 , Â§ 1, 7-16-19)
 
Sec. 1141. Applicability and organization.
A.	Applicability.
1.	Any new use or expansion of existing use that requires site plan review shall comply with the requirements of this article and other applicable requirements of this ordinance. 
2.	The requirements of this article shall not apply to: 
a.	Continuation of a permitted use within an existing structure. 
b.	Changes of use within existing structures that do not require increased parking. 
c.	Normal repair and maintenance of existing structures that do not increase its size or parking demand. 
B.	Regulating plan. The Ecorse Road form based district shall be governed by a regulating plan that is specific to the area. 
1.	The regulating plan based on the site type determines building form and allowable use for each property within a form-based district. 
2.	The regulating plan is based on three factors: site type; building form; and use group. 
a.	Site types. Site types, as set forth in section 1142.A., are determined by street orientation, lot size, lot configuration, location, and relationship to neighboring sites. Site type provides the basis for building forms and authorized use groups. 
b.	Building form standards and types. Building form standards and types, set forth in section 1142.B. and C., establish the parameters for building form, height, and placement, and are specifically applied to each district based upon the regulating plan. 
c.	Authorized use groups. Authorized land uses are organized by use groups. Authorized use groups, as set forth in section 1142.D., are specifically applied to each district based upon the regulating plan. 
3.	The steps to determine the regulations that apply to a specific property within a form-based district are as follows: 
a.	Find the site in question on the regulating plan map. 
b.	Identify the site type for the site in question. Sites will be classified site type A, B, or C. 
c.	Consult the use groups and building forms permitted table in which the site is located. The table will identify if a use group or building form is permitted, permitted with conditions, or not permitted for the site type and street type combination of the site in question. 
d.	Follow the regulations for the chosen building form when designing the development application. Building form regulations are established in section 1142.B. and 1142.C. 
e.	Follow the design standards as listed in section 1142.G. 
f.	Obtain site plan approval or special use approval for the chosen building form and use, as appropriate. 
 
C.	Design standards. General design standards, set forth in section 1142.G., are supplementary to other requirements of the ordinance. Generally, the design standards regulate building placement, parking orientation, landscaping, and other site design requirements. 
D.	Modification of district boundaries. Any modification to the boundaries of any form-based district shall require rezoning, in accordance with the provisions of article XXVII, changes and amendments. 
E.	Modification of regulating plan. Specific building form, use group, and design standards applied within each regulating plan are based upon the designation of site type. Any modification of site type may be determined by the planning commission, notice and after conducting a public hearing in accordance with section 2703. 
The planning commission shall consider the following in making a determination to modify a site type or street type designation: 
1.	The applicant's property cannot be used for the purpose permitted in the form-based district. 
2.	Area has been added to or deleted from the subject property in question, requiring the modification. 
3.	The proposed modification and resulting development will not alter the essential character of the area. 
4.	The proposed modification meets the intent of the district. 
5.	Existing streets have been improved and/or new streets constructed that may result in the modification of a specific site type. 
6.	Modification to the regulating plan is in conformance to the master plan and placemaking plan. 
F.	Nonconformities. Nonconformities shall be regulated in accordance with article XXII of the zoning ordinance. 
( Ord. No. 2019-487 , Â§ 1, 7-16-19)
 
Sec. 1142. Standards.
A.	Site types.
1.	Site type A (neighborhood residential or mixed-use sites). Site type A is composed of lots one-half acre or smaller and is reserved primarily for residential use and for smaller non-residential use which is compatible with a residential setting. Site type A is generally located in areas which serve as a transition between the Ecorse Road and neighboring residential areas. The building form selected for these sites must consider both the front elevation that fronts on the street but also the rear/side elevation that is adjacent to residential in order to maintain compatibility with adjacent uses. 
2.	Site type B (neighborhood commercial/office or mixed-use sites). Made up mostly of lots between one-half and one acre in area, the site type B category may include free standing single-use sites developed for commercial and office uses serving the surrounding neighborhood or mixed-use developments. Size and character may vary based on the unique characteristic of each parcel. Small retail and food-service uses would often be found in this category, as well as small single or multi-tenant commercial or office buildings. 
3.	Site type C (community commercial/office and mixed-use sites). The sites in site type C are mostly larger than one acre in area. Site type C size and character may vary based on the unique characteristic of each parcel. This category can include free standing single-use or mixed-use developments that are designed to serve a broader community-wide market. 
B.	Building form standards.
1.	The ERFC district permit a series of building forms, dependent on the site context. The building forms, set forth in [section] 1142.C., are designated within the district location based on the regulating plan. Building forms are classified in the following manner: 
a.	Permitted building forms. These building forms are permitted as of right in the locations specified. 
b.	Prohibited building forms. Building forms that are not identified as permitted in the locations specified are prohibited. 
c.	Exceptions: For all building forms in all locations, awnings, signs, other projections (architectural projections, bay windows, etc.) may project beyond the required building line by up to five feet. Projections will be reviewed by the township to ensure public safety. 
2.	The regulating plan dictates the site type for each individual property in the district. Building forms are identified within each district as permitted or not permitted based upon the site type. 
3.	Non-residential development height, setback, and greenbelt provisions when adjacent to any residentially zoned or used property. 
a.	Setback and greenbelt: 
i.	Site type A and B. The following setback and greenbelt shall be provided for any parcel zoned site type A or B that is adjacent to a residentially zoned or used parcel. 
a.	When a parcel is abutting or adjacent to a residentially zoned or used parcel without an intervening constructed alley or street, the building setback from the property line of the residentially zoned or used parcel shall be no less than the height of the building on the parcel zoned ERFB. 
b.	When a parcel is abutting or adjacent to a residentially zoned or used parcel without an intervening alley or street, a minimum ten-foot landscaped greenbelt shall be maintained from the property line of the residentially zoned or used parcel. The greenbelt shall be landscaped and screened with a solid fence or decorative wall up to six feet in height erected parallel to any common lot line, with a ten-foot wide planting strip along the base of the wall or fence that consists of one evergreen tree and one canopy tree per 30 lineal feet along the property line. 
c.	The planning commission may deviate from these setback and greenbelt provisions in the course of its site plan review process; however, the planning commission shall not permit a setback or greenbelt that is less than required in the building form. In the review of the deviation, the planning commission shall consider the standards as set forth in section 1142.B.3.b. 
ii.	Site type C. The following setback and greenbelt shall be provided for any parcel zoned site type C that is adjacent to a residentially zoned or used parcel. 
a.	When a property is abutting or adjacent to a residentially zoned or used parcel without an intervening alley or street, the setback from the property line of the residentially zoned or used parcel shall be no less than one and one-half times the height of the building on the non-residential parcel. 
b.	When a property is abutting or adjacent to a residentially zoned or used parcel without an intervening alley or street, a minimum 20-foot landscaped greenbelt shall be maintained from the property line of the residentially zoned or used parcel. The greenbelt shall be landscaped in accordance with section 2108.C. 
c.	The planning commission may deviate from these setbacks and greenbelt provisions in the course of its site plan review process; however, the planning commission shall not permit a setback or greenbelt that is less than required in the building form. In the review of the deviation, the planning commission shall consider the standards set forth in section 1142.B.3.b. 
b.	Deviation standards: 
i.	Height, setback, and greenbelt deviations may be granted by the planning commission if the following is found: 
a.	The deviation shall not adversely impact public health, safety, and welfare. 
b.	The deviation shall maintain compatibility with adjacent uses. 
c.	The deviation shall be compatible with the master plan and in accordance with the goals and objectives of the master plan and any associated subarea and corridor plans. 
d.	The deviation shall not adversely impact essential public facilities and services, such as: streets, pedestrian or bicycle facilities, police and fire protection, drainage systems, refuse disposal, water and sewage facilities, and schools. 
e.	The deviation shall be in compliance with all other zoning ordinance standards.

G.	Design standards. In addition to standards set forth in this ordinance, all proposed development shall comply with the standards set forth herein. 
1.	Pedestrian/non-motorized access.
a.	Intent. To ensure that site layout and building design provides safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access both to and within a site and between adjacent sites. 
b.	Standards.
i.	A pedestrian connection shall provide a clear connection between the primary street upon which the building fronts and the building. Connection may include pavement striping. 
ii.	Pedestrian access shall be clearly identified from parking areas and all entrances to a building. 
iii.	Where appropriate, sidewalks fronting the public right-of-way should be designed to accommodate space for activities such as outdoor dining. 
iv.	All sites shall provide a bike rack for at least two bicycles within 50 feet of the building entrance. 
2.	Building placement and orientation.
a.	Intent. To require building placement that provides a strong visual and functional relationship with its site, adjacent sites, and the primary street upon which the site is located. Ensure consistency within sites and to adjacent sites to provide distinct building groups which exhibit similar orientation, scale, and proportion. 
b.	Standards.
i.	Setbacks and building orientation shall reinforce a consistent pattern of siting. 
ii.	Primary building entrances shall be located so that they are easily identifiable with convenient public access. 
iii.	Buildings should enhance street corners through the use of prominent architectural or site features. 
3.	Parking placement, orientation, and screening.
a.	Intent. To provide a circulation system that efficiently moves vehicles in a well-defined manner, while reducing the visual impact of parking areas and mitigating conflict between pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles. 
b.	Standards.
i.	Required parking. Off-street parking shall be provided for a principal use erected, altered, or expanded after the effective date of this ordinance in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2104. 
a.	The form based districts are intended to encourage pedestrian and friendly design and compact mixed-use developments. Applicants are encouraged to consider the provisions for shared parking and flexibility in application set forth in section 2104. 
b.	The placement and design of parking areas and structures shall foster safe pedestrian access and circulation and clearly identifiable public access and visitor parking. Pedestrian access shall be provided between all parking areas and public building entrances. 
ii.	Location. 
a.	When parking is located in a side yard (behind the front building line) but fronts on the required building line, no more than 25 percent of the total site's linear feet along the required building line or 60 feet, whichever is less, shall be occupied by parking. 
b.	For a corner lot, no more than 25 percent of the site's cumulative linear feet along the required building lines or 60 feet, whichever is less, shall be occupied by parking. The building shall be located in the corner of the lot adjacent to the intersection. 
c.	Where off-street parking is visible from a street, it should be screened in accordance with the standards set forth in [section] 2108. 
4.	Architectural design and building materials.
a.	Intent. To create a character for the form-based district that encourage the greatest amount of visual interest, architectural consistency, and high-quality material use. The standards are not intended to limit imagination, innovation, or variety. 
b.	Architectural design standards.
i.	Building massing and scale. 
a.	Rooflines and pitches shall be proportionate to nearby structures so as to provide transition or mitigation of significant changes to scale. Variety in massing can occur though step-backs as a building ascends upward. 
b.	Buildings shall maintain a consistent street wall with the longest edge of the buildings oriented parallel to the roadway, where possible. 
c.	Buildings within the same development shall be designed to provide a unified and easily identifiable image. Methods to achieve this include using similar architectural styles and materials, complementary roof forms, signs, and colors. 
ii.	FaÃ§ade variation.

Sec. 1850. Wireless communication towers and antennas:
Because the uses hereinafter referred to possess unique characteristics making it impractical to include them in a specific use district classification, they may be permitted by the township board under the conditions specified, and after public hearing by the planning commission held in accord with section 2309 and further shall be reviewed as provided in section 2119 and after a recommendation has been received from the planning commission. In every case, the uses hereinafter referred to shall be specifically prohibited from any residential districts unless otherwise specified. 
These uses require special consideration since they service an area larger than the township, creating problems of control with reference to abutting use districts. Reference to those uses falling specifically within the intent of this section is as follows: 
1.	Wireless communication towers and antennas:
a.	Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines for the location of wireless communications towers and antennas. The objectives of this section are to encourage the co-location of multiple antennas on a single tower, to consider public health and safety in the location and operation of such towers and antennas, to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas, to limit visual impacts by promoting innovative design and screening of towers and to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure by requiring careful engineering and proper location of tower structures. 
b.	Definitions:
(1)	Abandoned tower or antenna: An antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months, or a tower constructed or maintained without an operational antenna shall be considered abandoned. 
(2)	Alternative tower structure: Manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, utility poles, flagpoles and similar decorative structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers. 
(3)	AM array: One or more tower units with a supporting ground system that functions as one AM broadcasting antenna shall be considered as one tower with a perimeter equaling the smallest rectangular figure that can encompass all elements associated with the array. Setbacks and other distances shall be measured from this perimeter. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of an approved array by right. 
(4)	Antenna: Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital or analog signals, radio frequencies (except radar) or other wireless communication signals. 
(5)	Amateur radio communications antenna: An antenna and associated support structure that is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator for personal use.

Towers and antennas requiring planning commission review shall be subject to special land use approval in accordance with section 2119 (special land uses). Applications, reviews and approvals for wireless communication towers and antennas shall be in accordance with the following: 
a.	The application is considered to be complete when the planning and zoning coordinator or his or her designee makes that determination 14 business days after the planning and zoning coordinator or his or her designee receives the application, whichever is first. 
If the planning and zoning coordinator or his or her designee notifies the applicant before the expiration of the 14-day period, that the application is not complete, specifying the information necessary to make the application complete, or notifies the applicant that a fee required to accompany the application has not been paid, specifying the amount due, the running of the 14-day period shall be tolled until the applicant submits to the director of the office of community standards or his or her designee the specified information or fee amount due. The notice shall be given in writing or by electronic notification. 
b.	The planning commission shall approve or deny the application not more than 60 days after the application is considered complete for wireless communication antennas co-located on an existing tower or 90 days for a new wireless communication tower, unless an extension in time is mutually agreed to between the applicant and the planning commission. If the planning commission fails to timely approve or deny the application, the application shall be considered approved. 
c.	A building permit shall not be issued until special conditional use approval and site plan approval have been granted by the planning commission. If no building permit is required, a certificate of occupancy or business license shall not be issued until special use approval and site plan approval have been granted by the planning commission. 
d.	The wireless communication tower or antenna shall not be authorized by the township board until special conditional use approval and site plan approval have been granted by the planning commission, if required. 
e.	After approval for a special use has been granted, no change in that use may be made, nor may any addition or change in the building or improvements on the property take place until a new request for approval has been filed with the planning commission and the planning commission has approved the request for change. 
f.	After approval of a special use has been granted by the planning commission, application for a building permit, or if no building permit is required, application for a certificate of occupancy or business license shall be filed with the building department within 120 days thereafter, or such approval shall automatically be revoked unless an extension is granted.

Sec. 1852. Private or public recreation vehicle campgrounds:
Recreation vehicle campgrounds are intended to provide sites for persons seeking a temporary location for vacation or recreation purposes with recreational units such as, but not limited to: tents, travel trailers, camping trailers, motor homes, truck campers, slide-in campers and chassis-mounted campers. It is recognized that there are areas contained in the community that were subjected to extensive mining operations formerly for sand and gravel with little or no concern given to its ultimate reclamation and reuse. Recreation vehicle campgrounds are considered to be an adaptable use for these areas that due to present grade elevations, drainage conditions, headwall slopes and the like that otherwise could not be developed soundly as a conventional residential subdivision. Therefore, it is the intent of this ordinance to permit recreation vehicle campgrounds to be located so as to allow reasonable use of these areas and provide a transition of use between extensive nonresidential areas, i.e., light and heavy industrial uses and single-family residential areas. Recreation vehicle campgrounds shall further be subject to the following conditions: 
a.	Locational requirements.
(1)	Parcels being proposed for recreation vehicle campgrounds may be permitted in the R-4 one-family residential district when said recreation vehicle campgrounds afford a buffer to I-I, I-2, and/or MH districts and single-family districts. A recreation vehicle campground shall not be bounded on more than three sides by a single-family residential district, except that the planning commission and township board may waive this requirement where it can be shown that the abutting property will be developed for nonresidential purposes or for another recreation vehicle campground. 
(2)	The site shall have direct access to a major thoroughfare, as designated on the major thoroughfare plan, and with appropriate frontage thereon to provide for the design of entrances and exits. 
b.	Site conditions. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall not create hazards to the property or the health or safety of the occupants. The site shall not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors or other adverse influences, and no portion subject to unpredictable and/or sudden flooding, subsidence or erosion shall be used for any purpose which would expose persons or property to hazards. 
c.	Uses permitted. Uses such as, but not limited to, campground sites, management headquarters, recreational facilities, toilets, showers, coin-operated laundry facilities, parking areas and other uses and structures customarily found incidental to this use, shall be permitted. Such uses shall be restricted in their use to occupants of the site, except that temporary storage of recreational vehicles may be permitted upon the site when it can be clearly demonstrated that such storage is ancillary to the recreation vehicle campgrounds and subject to the conditions set forth under [subsection] g(5) of this section. 
d.	Height and area requirements.
(1)	No building or structure hereafter erected or altered in a recreation vehicle campground shall exceed a height of one-story or 14 feet. 
(2)	Recreation vehicle campgrounds shall be permitted only on parcels of 25 acres or more. 
(3)	Each campground site shall have a minimum 40-foot road frontage and a minimum area of at least 2,400 square feet. 
e.	Yard and setback requirements.
(1)	No campground site shall be located closer than 200 feet to the right-of-way line of a major thoroughfare and 100 feet to the campground boundary when it abuts or is adjacent to a residential district. Where the campground abuts or is adjacent to a nonresidential district, no campground site shall be located closer than 35 feet. 
(2)	No service building or any other similar structure shall be located closer than 250 feet to a major thoroughfare or campground boundary. 
f.	Buffers and landscaping.
(1)	A greenbelt 20 feet in width and six feet in height shall be located and continually maintained along all campground borders. Where the campground borders a residential district, this greenbelt will provide a total obscuring effect. This greenbelt shall consist of such materials as trees and shrubs to provide privacy to occupants of the site and to visually shield the recreation vehicle campgrounds from surrounding property. Earthen berms are encouraged to be used to achieve this purpose. 
(2)	A chainlink fence of not less than four nor more than six feet in height shall be erected on the boundary line where any portion of the campgrounds abuts or is adjacent to a single-family residential district. 
g.	Other conditions.
(1)	All sanitary sewage and water facilities including connections provided to individual campground sites, shall meet the requirements of the Ypsilanti Township sewer and water departments and the Michigan State Health Department. 
(2)	Entrances and exits from county or state highways shall have the prior written approval of the highway authority having jurisdiction within the township. 
(3)	The campgrounds shall be located on a well-drained site properly graded to insure rapid drainage and freedom from stagnant pools. 
(4)	All lighting shall be shielded to reduce glare and shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from abutting or adjacent properties. 
(5)	Areas provided for the storage of recreational vehicles may be permitted subject to the following: 
(a)	The area shall be enclosed with a chainlink fence of not less than five feet in height.

Sec. 1901. Eligibility criteria:
To be eligible for PD consideration, the applicant must present a proposal for residential development that meets each of the following: 
(1)	Recognizable benefits. A PD shall result in a recognizable and substantial benefit, both to the residents of the property and to the overall quality of life in the township. The benefits can be provided through site design elements in excess of the requirements of this ordinance, such as high quality architectural design, extensive landscaping, provide transition areas from adjacent land uses, unique site design features, unified access, provision of social space, preservation of woodlands and open space, particularly along major thoroughfares, and buffering development from lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands. This benefit should accrue, in spite of any foreseeable detriments of the proposed development. 
(2)	Uses proposed. The uses proposed will have a beneficial effect, in terms of public health, safety, welfare or convenience or any combination thereof, on present and potential surrounding land uses. The uses proposed will encourage a more efficient use of public utilities and services and lessen the burden on circulation systems, surrounding properties, and the environment. This beneficial effect for the township (not the developer) shall be one which could not be achieved under any other single zoning classification. The zoning is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development proposal. 
(3)	Qualification requirements. The proposed development shall provide at least one of the following open space benefits: 
(a)	Significant natural assets. The site contains significant natural assets such as woodlands, rolling topography with grades exceeding 15 percent, significant views, natural drainage ways, water bodies, floodplains, regulated or non-regulated wetlands, or natural corridors that connect quality wildlife habitats which would be in the best interest of the township to preserve and which might be negatively impacted by conventional residential development. 
(b)	Recreation facilities. If the site lacks natural features, it can qualify if the development will preserve existing or provide new recreation facilities and open spaces to which all residents of the development shall have reasonable access. Such facilities include areas such as a neighborhood park, plazas, golf course, passive recreational facilities, soccer fields, ball fields, bike paths or similar facilities which provide a feature of community-wide significance and enhance residential development. 
(c)	Mixed use. A site can qualify if the development will provide a complimentary and integrated mixture of uses, residential densities and housing types. A mixed use project shall be considered a project which proposes a combination of single-family detached and multiple-family housing or a mixture of compatible residential and commercial uses. Such mixture of uses shall be integrated into a cohesive, pedestrian scale neighborhood. 
(d)	Infill development/redevelopment. Land located within the older urbanized area of the township north of I-94 designated in the master plan for townhouse residential may qualify for development as a PD where the design standards of section 1915 are met. 
(4)	Guarantee of open space. Usable open space shall be provided, as required herein. The applicant shall guarantee to the satisfaction of the township that all open space portions of the development will be maintained in the manner approved. Documents shall be presented that bind all successors and future owners in fee title to commitments made as a part of the proposal. This provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, provided notice of such transfer is provided to the township and the land uses and restrictions continue as approved in the PD plan. 
(5)	Cohesive neighborhood. The proposed development shall be designed to create cohesive community neighborhoods through a network of spaces such as parks, plazas and common open space areas for passive or active recreation and resident interaction. All open space areas shall be equally available to all residents of the PD. 
(6)	Unified control. The proposed development shall be under single ownership or control, such that there is a single person or entity having proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed. 
(7)	Density impact. The proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the need for or impact to public services, facilities, roads, and utilities in relation to the use or uses otherwise permitted by this ordinance, and shall not place an unreasonable impact to the subject and/or surrounding land and/or property owners and occupants and/or the natural environment. The township may require that the applicant prepare an impact statement documenting the significance of any environmental, traffic or socio-economic impact resulting from the proposed PD. An unreasonable impact shall be considered an unmitigateable, significant adverse effect on the quality of the surrounding community and the natural environment in comparison to the impacts associated with conventional development. The township may require that the applicant prepare a quantitative comparison of the impacts of conventional development and the PD plan to assist in making this determination (such as an overlay of conceptual development plans, on a natural features map, illustrating other site development options to demonstrate the impacts have been minimized to the extent practical). If the cumulative impact creates or contributes to a significant problem relative to infrastructure demand or environmental degradation, mitigation shall be provided to alleviate the impacts associated with the PD. 
(8)	Public utilities. All uses within the PD project shall be served by public water and sewer. 
(9)	Parking. Off-street parking sufficient to meet the minimum required by section 2104 shall be provided and may, if deemed appropriate by the township, require for planned developments more or less parking than that required by this ordinance. 
(10)	Landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided so as to ensure that proposed uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding public and private property. The township may, if deemed appropriate, require for PDs more or less landscaping than that required by this ordinance. 
(11)	Circulation. Vehicular and non-motorized (pedestrian) circulation, allowing safe, convenient, uncongested and well-defined/understandable circulation within and to the district; shall be provided. 
(12)	Master plan. The proposed development shall be consistent with and further the implementation of the master plan of future land use for the township. 
(Ord. No. 2003-328, 1-20-04)
 
Sec. 1902. Permitted uses:
(1)	Single-family residential. Detached single-family residential shall be permitted in any PD. 
(2)	Multiple-family residential. Multiple-family residential shall be permitted in any PD as follows: 
(a)	Where existing (pre PD) zoning is multiple-family residential, multiple-family dwelling units shall be permitted meeting the density and design standards of this ordinance. 
(b)	Where existing (pre PD) zoning is single-family residential, up to 40 percent of the dwelling units may be attached single-family housing, provided the remaining dwelling units (at least 60 percent) shall be detached single-family residential and provided further that at least an additional ten percent of the site will be preserved as open space, above the minimum requirement. 
(c)	Where existing (pre PD) zoning is multiple-family residential, senior housing may be permitted meeting the density and design standards of section 2002, Senior Housing Option. 
(3)	Nonresidential. Nonresidential uses shall be permitted in a PD as follows: 
(a)	Where existing (pre PD) district is zoned for nonresidential uses, all commercial business, services, professional offices and industrial uses listed as a permitted use in the existing (pre PD) zoning district shall be permitted. 
(b)	Where the existing (pre PD) zoning is residential, the township board may permit a commercial land use component in a PD with a gross area of 70 acres or more, provided the township board determines the use will be compatible with the surrounding area and all of the following are met: 
1.	The commercial component shall be located on a lot of sufficient size to contain all commercial structures, parking, and landscape buffering. The total area occupied by the commercial land uses may not exceed five percent of the gross area of the PD or three acres, whichever is less. 
2.	All commercial uses shall be compatible with the residential area. The allowable commercial uses within such an area shall be limited to those permitted in the B-1 local business district. 
3.	The township finds that the architectural design of the structures is compatible with the balance of the PD and surrounding development. 
4.	All commercial structures are integrated and connected to a non-motorized (pedestrian and bicycle) access system servicing the PD.

(Ord. No. 2003-328, 1-20-04)
 
Sec. 1903. Dwelling density:
(1)	Single-family residential. Where the existing (pre PD) zoning is single-family residential, the number of dwelling units allowable within a PD shall be determined through preparation of a "parallel plan." 
(a)	The applicant shall prepare, and present to the township for review, a parallel plan for the project that is consistent with state, county and township requirements and design criteria for a tentative preliminary plat. The parallel plan shall meet all standards for lot size, lot width and setbacks as normally required under article XX, Schedule of Regulations, neighborhood open space requirements, public roadway improvements and contain an area which conceptually would provide sufficient area for storm water detention. Lots in the parallel plan shall provide sufficient building envelope size without impacting wetlands regulated by the state department of environmental quality. 
(b)	The township shall review the design and determine the number of lots that could be feasibly constructed and be economically viable following the parallel plan. This number, as determined by the township, shall be the maximum number of dwelling units allowable for the PD. The regulatory flexibility of a PD may be allowed to cluster the dwellings on smaller lots or mix housing types, provided the overall density shall not exceed that determined in the parallel plan, unless a density bonus is provided under subsection (5) below. 
(2)	Multiple-family residential. Where the existing (pre PD) zoning is multiple-family residential, the density shall be the maximum allowed by the existing (pre PD) zoning district, unless a density bonus is provided under subsection (5) below. 
(3)	Nonresidential. Where the existing (pre PD) zoning is office or business (i.e. OS-1, B-1, B-2, B-3), residential may be permitted at the density permitted in RM-2. Such density shall be permitted in those portions of the PD proposed for residential use. Land areas of a PD proposed exclusively for nonresidential use shall not be counted towards the maximum allowable density. Residential dwelling units may be permitted on the same site as nonresidential uses, provided designated residential parking shall be provided in addition to parking requirements for commercial uses and the site and buildings shall be designed to allow a complementary mixture of uses on the site with minimal conflict, based upon the criteria of section 1901. 
(4)	Multiple existing (pre PD) zoning districts. Where a PD is proposed for a land area that includes multiple existing (pre PD) zoning districts, density shall be determined separately for each respective zoning district then combined for a maximum permitted dwelling unit density for the overall project. Following the determination of density, residential dwelling unit types may be integrated within the overall design for the project and need not be segregated by the existing (pre PD) zoning districts. The location and distribution of dwellings within the PD shall be determined through design that meets the intent of this ordinance, preservation of natural features and compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
(5)	Density bonus. At the option of the applicant and with approval by the township board, a variable density bonus of up to 20 percent may be allowed, based upon the general eligibility criteria of section 1901, and in particular the density impact evaluation of section 1901(7). Where a density bonus is granted, one or more of the following shall be required by the township board: 
(a)	A high level of clustered development where a minimum of 40 percent of the PD is common open space. 
(b)	Inclusion of an integrated mixture of housing types. 
(c)	Providing recreation facilities, plazas, town squares or "commons" available to the public. The applicant has the option to provide the additional public spaces or recreational facilities (above and beyond the minimum open space requirements) at an off-site location approved by the township board. 
(d)	Providing streetscape and roadway improvements along abutting thoroughfares. 
(e)	Removal or renovation of blighted buildings or cleanup of site contamination as documented through a phase I and phase II environmental site assessment and a baseline environmental assessment. 
(f)	Other similar elements as determined by the township board, based upon a findings of the planning commission. 
A PD proposed as senior housing shall not qualify for additional density, beyond that specified in section 2002, Senior Housing Option. 
(6)	Townhouse residential. Where a PD is proposed for a land area that is designated in the master plan for townhouse residential, residential shall be permitted at a density of up to ten dwelling units per acre. The 20 percent density bonus may be granted where the township board finds that the project will provide for a pedestrian-friendly traditional neighborhood with high-quality architecture and open spaces used for active recreation, which is properly integrated within the surrounding neighborhoods. 
(Ord. No. 2003-328, 1-20-04)
 
Sec. 1904. Area and bulk regulations:
(1)	Basic regulations. All regulations applicable to setbacks, parking and loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall be met in relation to each respective land use in the development based upon zoning districts in which the use is listed as a permitted or special conditional use. The height, bulk, and area conditions set forth in article XX, Schedule of Regulations, shall be used as guidelines for the use areas set forth in the PD plan. Within a single-family residential PD, lot sizes may be reduced below the minimum requirement of the existing (pre PD) zoning district, provided that the open space within the PD equals or exceeds the total area of lot size reduction. 
(2)	Regulatory flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent with the intent of the PD regulations, the township may permit specific departures from the requirements of the zoning ordinance for yards and lots as a part of the approval process. Any regulatory modification shall be approved through a finding by the township that the deviation shall result in a higher quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards. 
A table shall be provided on the site plan which specifically details all deviations from the established zoning area, height and setback regulations, off-street parking regulations, general provisions, or subdivision regulations which would otherwise be applicable to the uses and development proposed in the absence of this PD article. This specification should include ordinance provisions from which deviation are sought, and the reasons and mechanisms to be utilized for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare in lieu of the regulations from which deviations are sought. Only those deviations consistent with the intent of this ordinance shall be considered.

The open space along the exterior public roads shall generally have a depth of at least 100 feet, either landscaped or preserved in a natural wooded condition. This requirement shall not apply to townhouse residential PD developed under section 1915, which shall instead provide open space through parks, common greens, plazas or buffers. 
(6)	Open space corridors. Connections with adjacent open space, public land or existing or planned pedestrian/bike paths may be required by the township. 
(7)	Protection of open space.
(a)	The dedicated open space shall be set aside by the developer through an irrevocable conveyance that is found acceptable to the township, such as: recorded deed restrictions, covenants that run perpetually with the land, or conservation easements. 
(b)	Such conveyance shall assure that the open space will be protected from all forms of development, except as shown on an approved site plan, and shall never be changed to another use. Such conveyance shall:

3.	Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the open space. 
(c)	The dedicated open space shall forever remain open space, subject only to uses approved by the township on the approved site plan. Further subdivision of open space land or its use for other than recreation, conservation or agricultural purposes, except for easements for utilities and septic systems, shall be strictly prohibited. Open space may include golf course area, provided that it forever remains outdoor recreation or natural undeveloped land. 
(8)	Allowable structures. Any structure(s) or building(s) accessory to a recreation use may be erected within the dedicated open space, subject to the approved open space plan. These accessory structure(s) or building(s) shall not exceed, in the aggregate, one percent of the required open space area. 
(Ord. No. 2003-328, 1-20-04)
 
Sec. 1906. Natural features:
(1)	Preservation of natural features. The development shall be designed so as to preserve natural resources and natural features. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined by the township after review of a site analysis plan, prepared by the applicant, that inventories these features. The PD shall comply with the township woodlands ordinance. The limits of tree clearing and grading shall be clearly shown on the preliminary and final PD site plans. 
(2)	Habitat. If animal or plant habitats of significant value exist on the site, the township, as a condition of approval, may require that the PD plan preserve these areas in a natural state and adequately protect them as nature preserves or limited access areas. 
(3)	Open space setback. A minimum 50-foot wide undisturbed open space setback shall be maintained from the edge of any, lake, pond, river, stream or wetland; provided that the township may permit trails, boardwalks, observation platforms or other similar structures that enhance passive enjoyment of the site(s natural amenities within the setback.

Sec. 1907. Compatibility with adjacent uses:
(1)	Compatibility with adjacent uses. The proposed location of uses or structures that are of a significantly different scale or character than the abutting residential districts, such as access drives, parking areas, solid waste pick-up points, swimming pools, tennis courts and facilities of a similar nature, shall not be located near the boundary of the development or so as to negatively impact the residential use of adjacent lands. 
(2)	Transition areas. Where the PD abuts a single-family residential district, the township may require a transition area. Grading within the transition area shall be minimal unless needed to provide effective buffering or accommodate drainage. If the grade change adjacent to single-family residential is to be varied by more than three feet, the site plan shall include cross sections illustrating existing and proposed grades in relation to existing and proposed building heights. Perspective renderings from adjacent residential units are encouraged. The township shall review the proposed transition area to ensure compatibility. The township may require that the transition area consist of one or more of the following: 
(a)	A row of single-family lots or condominium sites similar to adjacent single-family development in terms of density, lot area, lot width, setbacks and building spacing. 
(b)	Woodlands, natural features or a landscaped greenbelt sufficient to provide an obscuring effect.

Notes related to table: 
(1)	Architectural features: Bay windows, window sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, overhanging eaves and other architectural features may project into a required side yard not more than two inches for each one foot of width of such side yard, and may extend into any front or rear yard not more than 24 inches. 
(2)	Terraces, decks and porches: Open porches may project into a required front yard up to 15 feet, with the exception of the R-5 one-family residential district where the open porch projection may not exceed ten feet. Open porches, decks and paved terraces may project up to 30 percent into a required minimum side or rear yard and may exceed the maximum permitted lot coverage by up to three percent. 
(l)	Setbacks in the RM districts shall meet the following requirements. 
(1)	In all RM districts, front, side or rear yards shall be required from the perimeter of the parcel and need not refer to spacing between buildings for a the same parcel. 
(2)	In RM-4 districts, the minimum setbacks from the lot lines shall be equal to the height of the building except: 
a.	Where a lot line abuts a street, one-half the width of the right-of-way as shown on the major thoroughfare plan may be considered as yard setback. 
b.	Where a lot line abuts a permanent public open space or parkway, one-half of the narrowest width of the open space or parkway immediately contiguous to the common property line may be considered as yard setback. In no instance, however, shall any yard setback be less than 50 feet. 
(3)	In all RM districts, there shall be a minimum of 20 feet of unobstructed setback between drives, maneuvering lanes and open parking spaces and any residential building or wall. 
(4)	In all RM districts, the minimum distance between any two buildings shall be regulated according to the length and height of such building, and in no instance shall this distance be less than 30 feet. (See illustration following this section.) The formula for regulating the required minimum distances between two buildings is as follows: 
Sâ=â 
Where: 
S = 	The required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of building A and any wall of building B or the vertical prolongation of either. 
La = 	The total length of building A. The total length of building A is the length of the portion or portions of a wall or walls of building A from which, when viewed directly from above, lines drawn perpendicular to building A will intersect any wall of building B. 
Lb = 	The total length of building B. The total length of building B is the length of that portion or portions of a wall of building B from which, when viewed directly above, lines drawn perpendicular to building B will intersect building A. 
Ha = 	The height of building A. The height of building A at any given level is the height above natural grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the length of a building A. 
Hb = 	The height of building B. The height of building B at any given level is the height above the natural grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the length of building B. 

(m)	No side yards are required along the interior side lot lines of the district, except as otherwise specified in the building code, provided that if walls of structures facing such interior side lot lines contain windows, or other openings, side yards of not less than ten feet shall be provided. Where a lot borders on a residential district or a street, there shall be provided a setback of not less than ten feet on the side bordering the residential district or street. 
(n)	No building shall be closer than 75 feet to the outer perimeter (property line) of such district, or to any major thoroughfare. 
(o)	No building shall be closer than 50 feet to the outer perimeter (property line) of such district when said property abuts any residential district. This requirement does not apply to sites zoned B-5 East Michigan Avenue business district or B-6 Ecorse/Ford business district. 
(p)	All storage shall be in the rear yard and shall be completely screened with an obscuring wall or fence, not less than six feet high, or with a chainlink-type fence and a greenbelt planting so as to obscure all view from any adjacent residential, office or business district or from a public street. 
(q)	The height of structures may exceed the maximum required herein for planned developments of 20 acres or more in area, provided that all yards shall be increased at least one foot in depth for each additional foot of building height above the maximum herein permitted. 
(r)	See article XVIII for modifications allowed and additional requirements. Mobile home parks shall be regulated in accord with Act No. 96 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1987 (MCL 125.1101 et seq.), as amended. 
(s)	Setback requirements, where such setbacks are to be provided from abutting streets, shall be provided whether such right-of-way is public, private or an access easement. 
(t)	In subdivisions platted prior to the date of adoption of this zoning ordinance and in which a building setback line is established on the lots abutting a lot or lots to be developed, such building line may be utilized as the setback line for new building construction. 
(u)	Minimum yards for site condominiums shall be provided in accordance with this zoning ordinance and shall be computed as follows: 
(1)	Minimum front yard setbacks shall be equal to the distance between the front yard area line and the condominium dwelling. 
(2)	Minimum rear yard setbacks shall be equal to the distance between the rear yard area line and the condominium dwelling. For two back-to-back units, the separation shall equal two rear yard setbacks. 
(3)	Minimum side yard setbacks shall be equal to the distance between the side yard area line and the condominium dwelling. For two side-to-side units, the separation shall equal two side yard setbacks. 
(v)	Dwellings existing and dwellings to be constructed on lots of record in and subdivisions having received tentative preliminary plat approval and on sites in site condominium subdivisions having received preliminary approval prior to the date of adoption of this amendment shall be permitted provided such lots and structures comply with lot area, width and setback requirements of the zoning ordinance at the time of approval. 
(w)	Any submerged area of a lake, river, pond or stream, or regulated wetlands shall not count towards meeting the minimum lot area for single-family lots. Computation of dwelling unit density requirements in RM zones shall not include submerged areas of a lake, river, pond or stream, and regulated wetlands. 
(x)	Open space setback: An undisturbed open space setback of not less than 50 feet shall be maintained from the edge of any lake, pond, river or stream, including, but not limited to the Huron River, Paint Creek and their tributaries. An undisturbed open space setback of not less than 25 feet shall be maintained from the edge of any drain or wetland. Such setbacks shall be measured from the top of the bank or other defined edge and shall not be subject to topography. 
The township may permit trails, boardwalks, observation platforms or similar structures that enhance passive enjoyment of a site's natural amenities within the setback as part of an approved site plan. 
(y)	Any residential subdivision, condominium or multiple-family development comprising 20 or more lots or dwelling units, either as a single development or as a group of adjacent developments offered by a single proprietor, shall provide an active recreational area which shall contain an area equal in size to 1,500 square feet for each lot or dwelling unit in the subdivision or condominium project or multiple-family development. Said recreational area shall be well drained, graded, seeded or sodded, safe from hazard, accessible to all dwellings, and the location shall be approved by the planning commission. Reservation of the recreational area shall be achieved through deed restrictions or dedication to a subdivision homeowner's association. 
(z)	The planning commission may approve a reduction of the minimum required front yard setback for buildings in this district, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)	The development parcel or zoning lot has frontage on only one public street and is not a corner lot. 
(2)	The architectural character of all facades that are visible from the street shall be upgraded to include primarily glass, brick, cut stone, cast stone, smooth stucco or wood. Concrete block, EIFS and other synthetic materials shall be eliminated from these facades, except for minor architectural accents as may be approved by the planning commission. 
(3)	A reduction in the required front yard setback would result in an unsafe traffic or pedestrian safety condition. 
(aa)	Where a parcel that is within 500 feet of the I-94 right-of-way is proposed to be developed for residential purposes by means of a multiple-family development, condominium, subdivision plat or planned development, such site plan or plat shall delineate that area of the site with sound levels of 61 dBA or greater. No dwelling units shall be located within this 61 dBA or greater area unless one of the following measures is taken: 
(1)	Sound walls or earth berming are installed to attenuate the noise level to less than 61 dBA at the location of all dwellings and all yard areas within 35 feet of all single-family dwellings. 
(2)	Sound attenuation measures incorporated into the design and construction of the dwellings, such as masonry construction and insulation resulting in interior noise levels less than 52 dBA. 
(bb)	Open space setback: An undisturbed open space setback of not less than 50 feet shall be maintained from the edge of any lake, pond, river or stream, including, but not limited to the Huron River, Paint Creek and their tributaries. An undisturbed open space setback of not less than 25 feet shall be maintained from the edge of any drain or wetland. Such setbacks shall be measured from the top of the bank or other defined edge and shall not be subject to topography. 
The township may permit trails, boardwalks, observation platforms or similar structures that enhance passive enjoyment of a site's natural amenities within the setback as part of an approved site plan. 
(cc)	Any residential subdivision, condominium or multiple-family development comprising 20 or more lots or dwelling units, either as a single development or as a group of adjacent developments offered by a single proprietor, shall provide an active recreational area which shall contain an area equal in size to 1,500 square feet for each lot or dwelling unit in the subdivision or condominium project or multiple-family development. Said recreational area shall be well drained, graded, seeded or sodded, safe from hazard, accessible to all dwellings, and the location shall be approved by the planning commission. Reservation of the recreational area shall be achieved through deed restrictions or dedication to a subdivision homeowner's association. 
(dd)	The planning commission may approve a reduction of the minimum required front yard setback for buildings in this district, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)	The development parcel or zoning lot has frontage on only one public street and is not a corner lot, 
(2)	The architectural character of all facades that are visible from the street shall be upgraded to include primarily glass, brick, cut stone, cast stone, smooth stucco or wood. Concrete block, EIFS and other synthetic materials shall be eliminated from these facades, except for minor architectural accents as may be approved by the planning commission. 
(3)	A reduction in the required front yard setback would result in an unsafe traffic or pedestrian safety condition. 
(ee)	Where a parcel that is within 500 feet of the I-94 right-of-way is proposed to be developed for residential purposes by means of a multiple-family development, condominium, subdivision plat or planned development, such site plan or plat shall delineate that area of the site with sound levels of 61 dBA or greater. No dwelling units shall be located within this 61 dBA or greater area unless one of the following measures is taken: 
(1)	Sound walls or earth berming are installed to attenuate the noise level to less than 61 dBA at the location of all dwellings and all yard areas within 35 feet of all single-family dwellings. 
(2)	Sound attenuation measures incorporated into the design and construction of the dwellings, such as masonry construction and insulation resulting in interior noise levels less than 52 dBA. 
Where a planned development is proposed under article XIX, PD planned development regulations, the open space requirements of article XIX may be provided as an open space buffer in the area of the site that has sound levels of 61 dBA or greater, where this will cluster the dwellings within the area of the site that has sound levels of less than 61 dBA.

b.	For the purpose of computing the number of parking spaces required, the definition of "useable floor area" in article II, "Definitions," sec. 201 shall govern. 
c.	When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall require one parking space. 
d.	Two or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the required off-street parking in which case the required number of parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses computed separately, except as provided below. 
e.	The planning commission may reduce the parking requirements based upon a finding that there will be a lower demand for parking due to one or more of the following: 
(1)	Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high proportion of multipurpose visits or uses have peak parking demands during differing times of the day or days of the week. Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses. Where uses are on separate lots, the lots shall be adjacent, pedestrian, and vehicular connections shall be maintained between the lots and shared parking agreements shall be filed with the county register of deeds and the township. 
(2)	Expectation of walk-in trade due to sidewalk connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers. The site design shall incorporate pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian circulation providing safe and convenient access to the building entrance. 
(3)	Availability of other forms of travel such as transit. The planning commission may require the site design incorporate transit stops, pedestrian connections to nearby transit stops or bicycle parking facilities. 
f.	Where the conditions of subsection e. above are not met, but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the planning commission may defer some of the parking, provided the site plan designates portions of the site for future construction of the required parking spaces. Areas reserved for future parking shall be maintained in a landscaped appearance and not used for building area, storage, or other accessory use. The deferred parking shall be required to meet ordinance requirements if constructed and may not occupy required greenbelts. Construction of the deferred parking area to add parking spaces may be initiated by the owner or required by the community and economic development director, based on parking needs or observation, and shall require administrative approval of an amended site plan. 
g.	In order to minimize excessive areas of pavement which reduces aesthetic standards and contribute to high rates of storm water runoff, exceeding the minimum parking space requirements by more than 20 percent shall only be allowed with approval by the Planning Commission. In granting such additional space, the Planning Commission shall determine that such parking will be required, based on documented evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical day. 
4.	Accessible Parking. Accessible parking shall comply with the provisions of the American's With Disabilities Act (ADA). The number and layout of spaces required shall comply with ADA accessibility guidelines including the following: 
Accessible Parking Spaces* 
(Required Minimum) 	AccessibleSpaces

In the office, business and industrial districts, off-street parking may be permitted in the required front yard provided a minimum unobstructed and landscaped setback of 20 feet is provided. The setback is measured from the nearest point of the off-street parking area, exclusive of access driveways, and the nearest right-of-way line as indicated on the thoroughfare plan of the master plan of future land use. 
b.	Off-street parking shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from all lot lines in all zoning districts. 
c.	Off-street parking for other than residential use shall be either on the same lot or within 300 feet of the building it is intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the building to the nearest point of the off-street parking lot. Ownership shall be shown of all lots or parcels intended for use as parking by the applicant. 
d.	Required residential off-street parking spaces shall consist of a parking strip, parking bay, driveway, garage, or combination thereof, and shall be located on the premises they are intended to serve, and subject to the provisions of section 2103, accessory buildings and accessory uses, of this article. Front yard parking on other than a driveway or in an established apron between a curb and property line shall be prohibited. 
6.	Off-street parking space layout, and construction. Whenever the off-street parking requirements in this section require the building of an off-street parking facility, or where P-1 vehicular parking districts are provided, such off-street parking lots shall be laid out, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards and regulations: 
a.	No parking lot shall be constructed unless and until a permit therefore is issued by the building official. Applications for a permit shall be submitted to the township in such form as may be determined by the building official and shall be accompanied with two sets of plans for the development and construction of the parking lot showing the provisions of this section will be fully complied with. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2115 of this article, in those instances where an existing building use has provided adequate parking under this ordinance and a change of use is proposed wherein parking requirements for such proposed new use are equal to or lesser than those available on the site, site plan review by the planning commission shall not be required. Such parking lot shall receive the review of the building official. 

b.	All spaces shall be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering lanes. Backing directly onto a street shall be prohibited. Parking lots shall meet the following dimensional requirements:

f.	The entire parking area, including parking spaces and maneuvering lanes, required under this section shall be provided with asphalt or concrete surfacing in accordance with specifications approved by the township engineer. The parking area shall be surfaced prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or, in case of seasonal difficulties, a guarantee acceptable to the township. In those instances where a parking area is nonconforming with respect to paving, the expansion of the use of land or structure shall require the paving of such parking area in conformity with this section. The planning commission may approve alternative paving materials, such as permeable/grass pavers, for overflow, seasonal or low usage parking, based upon the review and recommendation of the township engineer. 
g.	Off-street parking areas shall be drained so as to dispose of all surface water accumulated in the parking area in such a way as to preclude drainage of water onto adjacent property or toward buildings. 
h.	Off-street parking shall be provided with concrete curbs, where necessary to protect landscaped areas, sidewalks, buildings, or adjacent property from vehicles that might otherwise extend beyond the edge of the parking lot. Sidewalks abutting parking spaces shall be seven feet wide. Plantings shall be set back sufficient distance from curbs to allow for bumper overhang. 
i.	To facilitate movement and to help maintain an orderly parking arrangement, all parking spaces shall be clearly striped with paint. Except for parallel parking spaces, each stall shall be delineated with four-inch wide double yellow lines 24 inches apart. The width of the parking stall may be computed from the centers of the double striping. 
7.	Landscaping and screening.
a.	The parking area shall be so designed as to provide a landscape plan in accord with section 2108 of this article. 
b.	When a front yard setback is required, all land between said wall and the front property line or street right-of-way line shall be kept free from refuse and debris and shall be landscaped with deciduous shrubs, evergreen material and ornamental trees. The ground area shall be planted and kept in lawn. All such landscaping and planting shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance. 
c.	Where an off-street parking area is located within a yard that adjoins a residential zoning district, the off-street parking area shall be provided with a continuous obscuring wall on all sides facing the residential district. 
(1)	The wall shall be constructed of brick and be not less than four feet six inches in height measured from the surface of the parking area.

1.	Purpose, intent and definitions.
a.	These regulations establish rules and standards for the construction, location, maintenance and removal of all signs except those exempted from regulation by this ordinance. Directional, emergency, or traffic-related signs owned by the township, county, state or federal government agencies are not regulated by this section.

In order that such purposes can be achieved, the following objectives shall be applied for this ordinance and any future additions, deletions and amendments: 
(1)	General. Ensure that signs are located, designed, constructed, installed and maintained in a way that protects life, health, morals, property and the public welfare. 
(2)	Public safety. Protect public safety by prohibiting signs that: 
i.	Are structurally unsafe or poorly maintained; 
ii.	Cause unsafe traffic conditions because they unreasonably distract motorists, have similarities to official traffic signs or hinder vision; and 
iii.	Impede safe movement of pedestrians or safe ingress and egress from buildings or sites. 
(3)	Protect aesthetic quality of districts and neighborhoods. Prevent blight and protect aesthetic qualities by preventing visual clutter and protecting views. Prevent proliferation of signs in residential areas and eliminate abandoned signs and sign structures on unused properties. Avoid glare and light trespass through selection of proper fixture type(s) and location, lighting technology, and control of light levels. 
(4)	Free speech. Ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected and allow signs as a means of communication. 
(5)	Reduce conflict. Reduce conflict among signs and light and between public and private information systems. 
(6)	Business identification. Allow for adequate signage for business identification and other commercial speech, non-commercial speech, and dissemination of public information, including but not limited to, public safety information and notification as may be required by law. 
(7)	Foster economic development. Ensure that signs are located in a manner that does not cause visual clutter, blight, and distraction, but rather promotes identification and communication necessary for sustaining and expanding economic development in the city.

(e)	In lieu of provisions of construction of safety paths, funds may be required to be placed in escrow for construction at a later date. 
(Ord. No. 97-166, 5-20-97)
 
Sec. 2115. Site plan review.
(1)	Intent. The site plan review procedures and standards set forth herein provide a consistent and uniform method for review of proposed development plans, to ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this section, other applicable local ordinances, standard engineering practices, and county, state, and federal rules, and laws. The procedures set forth herein are further intended to: 
(a)	Achieve efficient use of the land; 
(b)	Protect natural resources; 
(c)	Minimize adverse impacts on adjoining or nearby properties; 
(d)	Provide a mechanism for review of new development and redevelopment or reuse of existing sites to ensure compliance with current standards; and, 
(e)	Encourage cooperation and consultation between the township and the applicant to facilitate development in accordance with the township's land use objectives. 
(2)	Site plan review applicability and type. A building permit shall not be issued until a site plan or sketch plan is approved in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth herein and all necessary review, inspection, and permit fees have been fully paid. The extent of site plan review for various types of projects is classified into five types in the table below (Table 2115.1). 
(a)	Exempt: Select projects, such as single family homes on an individual lot, are exempt from site plan review given their relatively low level of impact on adjacent land uses, and given that compliance with applicable building and fire code and zoning regulations can be addressed during the building permit review process. 
(b)	Full site plan: The most involved process for larger and more intense projects, including most new developments and major expansions. 
(c)	Sketch plan: Smaller scale projects and expansions or changes in use to existing sites are permitted to provide less detailed information than a full scale site plan review. The level of information is intended to be proportionate to the extent of the change and yet insure adequate review for compliance with applicable standards. Sketch plans shall still undergo a formal review by the planning commission. 
(d)	Administrative review: Select smaller scale projects and expansions or changes in use to existing sites, which are required to provide a sketch plan, do not require review by the planning commission; but instead shall undergo a formal review for approval by the township community and economic development department. 
(e)	Site condominiums and planned developments: Site plans for site condominiums and planned developments shall follow the procedure as provided in sections 2116 and 1903 respectively. Plats for subdivisions shall follow the procedures of the township subdivision regulations ordinance number 44 and the Michigan Land Division Act. Site condominiums shall be required to meet the same design standards as subdivision plats, in accordance with the township zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations ordinance and all other applicable township regulations. 
(f)	Multiple-family and condominiums: Site plans for multiple-family and condominium developments shall require the review and approval of both preliminary and final plans by the planning commission and township board.

1.	Requires review and approval by the planning commission (see section 2115(3)). 
2.	The township community and economic development department has authority for approval (see section 2115(4)). If the modifications are not deemed minor, then normal site plan review by the planning commission shall be required. Planning commission review shall be required for all site plans that involve a request for a variance, a special conditional use, or discretionary decisions. 
3.	A building permit, plot plan, grading and engineering review is still required. 
4.	For a golf course, a general layout of holes, ball trajectory and natural features is required; full site plan review is required for buildings, structures and parking areas that illustrate the area around such facilities. 
5.	Construction, grading, drainage and erosion control plans must be approved by the township engineer. 
6.	See also the township natural features ordinance. 
7.	See Section 2107.1 Wireless communication towers and antennas. 
(3)	Planning commission site plan review procedures and requirements. Site plans and sketch plans must be submitted in accordance with the following procedures and requirements. Plans are reviewed and approved following a process of pre-conceptual review, preliminary site plan review by the planning commission and final site plan review by the community development department. 
(a)	Applicant attendance: The application shall be submitted by the owner of an interest in the land for which site plan approval is sought, or the designated agent of said owner. The applicant or a designated representative must be present at all scheduled review meetings or consideration of the plan shall be tabled due to lack of representation. Absence at two consecutive meetings without prior notice to the township community and economic development department shall result in denial of the application. The township office of community standards may recommend to the planning commission chairperson that the applicant's architect or engineer be required to be present at the meeting in order to address technical matters related to the application. 
(b)	Pre-application meeting: The applicant is encouraged to schedule a meeting with the township office of community standards to discuss the project, submittal requirements and review procedures. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss applicable standards and technical issues, and to determine the appropriate type of review process based on Table 2115.1. If the project is determined to be eligible for administrative approval, the procedures of section 2115(4) shall be followed; in other cases, the process shall proceed as described below. 
(c)	Preliminary site plan or sketch plan submittal: The applicant shall submit five paper copies and a single digital copy of the following to the office of community standards no more than 20 business days prior to the planning commission meeting that the site plan is tentatively scheduled for: 
1.	A complete application form supplied by the township. 
2.	A complete site plan or sketch plan that includes the information listed in section 2115(5), submittal requirements. 
3.	Any additional information the planning commission finds necessary to make the determinations required herein. 
(d)	Technical (staff) reviews: The township office of community standards shall forward the application and site plan(s) to the township planning, traffic and engineering consultants, the fire chief, and police chief. All reviews shall be submitted back to the township office of community standards. 
(e)	Planning commission consideration of preliminary site plan: Following technical review and comment, and compliance with administrative procedures, the site plan shall be placed on the agenda of the planning commission. The planning commission shall review the application for site plan approval, together with the reports and recommendations from staff, consultants and other reviewing agencies, as appropriate. The planning commission shall then make a determination based on the requirements and standards of this section. The planning commission is authorized to postpone, grant approval, approval subject to revisions or denial as follows: 
1.	Postpone: The application may be postponed if it is determined to be incomplete, the applicant has not fully responded to deficiencies identified in the technical review, an ordinance interpretation or variance is needed from the zoning board of appeals, or that revisions are necessary to bring the site plan into compliance with applicable standards and regulations. The planning commission shall direct the applicant to prepare additional information, revise the site plan or direct the township staff to conduct additional analysis. The applicant shall be required to prepare revised plans accompanied by a complete list of all changes, certified as such by the applicant's design professional. Full sets of plans must be resubmitted. Amended plans or other material which show a diligent effort to address all reasons for tabling shall be placed on the agenda of the planning commission for further review and action. 
2.	Approval: Upon determination that all requirements for site plan approval, as set forth herein, are met and a recommendation for approval has been forwarded to the planning commission by all reviewing agencies of the township, approval shall be granted subject to the applicant providing copies of all required outside agency approvals. In those instances where approval authority is vested with the township board, a recommendation shall be made by the planning commission to the township board. 
3.	Approval subject to revisions: Upon determination that a site plan is in compliance except for minor revisions, said revisions shall be identified and the applicant shall be given the opportunity to correct the site plan prior to applying for final site plan approval. The applicant shall submit with the final site plan a complete list of all changes, certified by the applicant's design professional, to the township office of community standards for final approval after said revisions have been completed. At its discretion, the planning commission may require the right to review the revised final site plan. 
4.	Denial of approval: Upon determination that a site plan does not comply with standards and regulations set forth in this section, requires extensive revision in order to comply with said standards and regulations, or the applicant has not satisfactorily addressed all reasons for site plan tabling, site plan approval shall be denied. The applicant must revise the plans and resubmit if the applicant is still interested in pursuing the project. A re-submittal shall be considered a new site plan and be required to re-initiate the full site plan review process. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission in denial of a site plan shall have the right to appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals. A site plan, by request of the applicant, needs an official denial by the planning commission in order to gain access to the zoning board of appeals. 
(f)	Multiple-family and condominiums preliminary approval: Site plans for multiple-family and condominium developments shall require the review and approval of both preliminary and final plans by the planning commission and township board. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the township board to approve, approve with conditions or deny the preliminary site plan. Following receipt of the planning commission's recommendation, the preliminary site plan shall be considered by the township board. The township board shall take action on the request following the same standards as subsection (f) above. 
(g)	Effect of preliminary site plan review action: Any preliminary site plan approved under this provision shall expire after one year from the date of such approval. If construction has not commenced within one year of site plan or sketch plan approval by the planning commission or the township office of community standards (as applicable), approval becomes null and void and a new application for site plan or sketch plan review shall be required. The applicant may request a one-year extension by the planning commission, provided a written request is received before the expiration date and the site plan complies with current standards (i.e. any amendments to the zoning ordinance since the site plan was approved). This limitation shall not apply to preliminary PD site plans accompanying approved PD rezonings. 
(h)	Final site plans (detailed construction and engineering plans): Except where otherwise set forth in this section, final site plan approval may be given administratively when all conditions set forth herein for final site plans are complied with except the planning commission may, at the time of preliminary site plan approval, require final site plan approval by the commission as well. The township office of community standards shall grant final site plan approval where the following requirements are met: 
1.	That all local, county and state requirements as may apply to the proposed use are met. The applicant shall be required to obtain all other necessary agency permits from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Washtenaw County Road Commission, Drain Commission and Health Department, and all applicable utility companies. Copies of applications and approvals from all applicable outside agencies shall accompany submission of the application and final site plan to the township. 
2.	All applicable engineering requirements are met. Complete engineering plans shall be submitted for approval by the township engineer. 
3.	The design shown on the final site plan shall remain unchanged from the approved preliminary site plan. Upon determination that the final site plan does not comply with the conditions of preliminary site plan approval or that required engineering plan revisions alter the site plan configuration approved by the planning commission, the applicant shall be required to revise the site plan and engineering plans and resubmit the site plan to the body that approved the site plan for review and approval as an amended site plan. 
(i)	Multiple-family and condominiums: Final site plans for multiple-family and condominium developments shall require the review and approval by the township board based upon a review and recommendation by the planning commission. 
(j)	Final site approval: Final site plan approval, except as specifically permitted in subsections 1. and 2. below, shall not be given until all the above requirements are met. No work shall commence on any site, except as specifically permitted herein, or any buildings requiring site plan approval and no permits shall be issued until after final site plan approval is granted.

It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain all other applicable township, utility, county, or state permits prior to issuance of a building permit. 
2.	The approval of any site plan under this provision, other than subdivisions (subdivision shall follow the procedures of the Land Division Act) shall expire one year after the date of such approval, unless actual construction and development have been commenced in accordance with said site plan prior thereto. If such construction and development is commenced within said one year period, then such approval shall continue for a period of five years from the date thereof; provided, however, that a lapse of more than one year in continuous substantial construction and development does not occur, in which event, said approval shall expire. The township building official shall not issue a building permit for any type of construction on the basis of the approved site plan after such approval has expired unless such plan has received an extension from the planning commission or township board. Fees for review of expired site plan may be waived or reduced in those instances where no substantial change in conditions of the site plan nor of abutting uses has taken place. In those instances where conditions have changed, the fee for review of expired site plans shall be the same as for the initial submittal. Any preliminary site plan approved under this provision shall expire after one year from the date of such approval. 
3.	It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a property for which site plan approval has been granted to maintain the property in accordance with the approved site design on a continuing basis until the property is razed, or until new zoning regulations supersede the regulations upon which site approval was based, or until a new site design approval is sought. Such maintenance shall include all building and site elements depicted on the site plan including parking configuration, lighting and landscaping. Any property owner who fails to maintain a site as approved shall be deemed in violation of the applicable use provisions of this section and shall be subject to penalties. 
4.	A development agreement with suitable guarantee may be required by the township to assure compliance with an approved final site plan.

Sec. 2120. Performance standards:
No use otherwise allowed shall be permitted within any district which does not conform to the following standards of use, occupancy, and operation, which standards are hereby established as the minimum requirements to be maintained within said area: 
1.	Smoke: It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to permit the emission of any smoke from any source whatever to a density greater than that density described as no. 2 on the Ringelmann chart; provided that the following exceptions shall be permitted: 
a.	Smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to but not darker than no. 3 on the Ringelmann chart for a period, or periods, aggregating four minutes in any 30 minutes. 
b.	Smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to but not darker than no. 3 of the Ringelmann chart for a period or periods, aggregating three minutes in any 15 minutes, when building a new fire or when breakdown of equipment occurs such as to make it evident that the emission was not reasonably preventable. 
Method of measurement: For the purposes of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann chart, as now published and used by the United States Bureau of Mines, which is hereby made a part of this ordinance, shall be the standard. However, the umbrascope readings of smoke densities may be used when correlated with Ringelmann's chart. 
2.	Dust, dirt and fly ash: No person, firm or corporation shall operate or cause to be operated, maintain or cause to be maintained, any process for any purpose, or furnace or combustion device for the burning of coal or other natural or synthetic fuels, without maintaining and operating while using said process or furnace or combustion device, recognized and approved equipment, means, method, device or contrivance to reduce the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids of fumes emitted into the open air, which is operated in conjunction with said process, furnace, or combustion device so that the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids shall not exceed 0.20 grains per cubic foot of the carrying medium at a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Method of measurement: For the purpose of determining the adequacy of such devices these conditions are to be conformed to when the percentage of excess air in the stack does not exceed 50 percent at full load. The foregoing requirement shall be measured by the A.S.M.E. Test Code of dust-separating apparatus. All other forms of dust, dirt and fly ash shall be completely eliminated insofar as escape or emission into the open air is concerned. The building inspector may require such additional data as is deemed necessary to show that adequate and approved provisions for the prevention and elimination of dust, dirt and fly ash have been made. 
3.	Glare and radioactive materials: Glare from any process (such as or similar to arc welding, or acetylene torch cutting) which emits harmful ultraviolet rays shall be performed in such a manner as not be seen from any point beyond the property line, and as not to create a public point beyond the property line, and as not to create a public nuisance or hazard along lot lines. Radioactive materials and wastes, and including electromagnetic radiation such as X-ray machine operation, shall not be emitted to exceed quantities established as safe by the U.S. Bureau of Standards, when measured at the property line. 
4.	Fire and explosive hazards:
a.	In the I-1 industrial district, the storage, utilization or manufacture of materials or products ranging from incombustible to moderate burning, as determined by the fire marshal, is permitted, subject to compliance with all other performance standards above mentioned. 
b.	The storage, utilization, or manufacture of materials, goods, or products ranging from free to active burning to intense burning, as determined by the fire marshal is permitted subject to compliance with all other yard requirements and performance standards previously mentioned, and provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1)	Said materials or products shall be stored, utilized or produced within completely enclosed buildings or structures having combustible exterior walls, which meet the requirements of the building code. 
(2)	All such buildings or structures shall be set back at least 40 feet from lot lines, or in lieu thereof, all such buildings or structures shall be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system complying with installation standards prescribed by the National Fire Association. 
(3)	The storage and handling of flammable liquids, liquified petroleum gases, and explosives shall comply with the state rules and regulations as established by Public Act No. 207 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1941 (MCL 29.1 et seq., MSA 4.559(1) et seq.), as amended. 
5.

Sec. 2123. Access management and driveway standards.
Uses permitted in this section shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(1)	In those instances where the planning commission finds that an excessive number of ingress or egress points may occur with relation to major or secondary thoroughfares, thereby diminishing the carrying capacity of the thoroughfare, or where the township master plan designates thoroughfares for the provision of marginal service roads, the commission may require the provision of marginal service roads and to assure adequate traffic circulation on the site, may require the development of parking so that contiguous lots on abutting properties will allow traffic circulation from one property to another without reentering the public thoroughfare. 
(2)	The pavement of the marginal service road shall be located 30 feet from the future right-of-way line of the thoroughfare and shall be at least 24 feet wide and shall be constructed in accord with "Engineering Design Specifications for Site Improvements," section 6, unless otherwise provided herein. Such service road shall be an easement which will permit the use of the service road for traffic circulation from one property to another. Such easement shall be in a written form acceptable to the township board and approved by the township board prior to the issuance of a building permit. No permanent structures such as curbs shall be permitted within the easement. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the easement so that it remains usable as a means of getting from one property to another. The easement shall be recorded with the county register of deeds prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. 
(3)	In reviewing the site plan, the planning commission may permit parking in the easement area, provided that the layout is such that parking can be removed at a later date when the marginal service road is needed for access to adjacent properties without disrupting the layout of the parking area. Temporary parking spaces permitted within the marginal service road easement shall not be included in computing the minimum off-street parking requirements under section 2104. 
(4)	Where marginal service roads are required, the planning commission shall recommend that the entire 24 foot area be paved up to the abutting properties. Backing from parking spaces onto the marginal service road shall not be permitted except on a temporary basis. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the marginal service road at the property line and the building inspector shall maintain a record of all marginal service road elevations so that their grades can be coordinated. Marginal service road elevations shall conform to elevations established by the Township or, if not so established be not more than one foot above or below the elevation of the adjoining property. Paving of the marginal service road shall meet construction specifications set by the township. 
(5)	The 30-foot setback area between the future road right-of-way and the marginal service road shall be kept in grass and landscaped in accordance with plans approved by the planning commission. The maintenance of the grass and the landscaped area shall be the obligation of the abutting property owner. 
(6)	Temporary entrances and exits may be approved for individual sites provided money is placed in escrow to assure elimination of temporary entrances and exits. Occupancy permits shall not be issued until monies have been deposited with the township. As a guideline, the national highway institute standards may be utilized by the planning commission in determining spacing for temporary entrances and exits.

(7)	In determining which entrances and exits will be permanent and which shall be temporary, the planning commission shall generally be guided by a minimum distance of 600 feet between entrances and exits and by the location of existing or approved drives on the opposite side of the street. 
(8)	Before obtaining a building permit for a permitted use, the owners of all property shall submit to the township a properly executed and witnessed license agreement which gives the township board the authority to open and dose marginal service roads and driveways whenever necessary in order to guarantee, to the satisfaction of the township board, a safe and efficient movement of traffic. The license may be recorded in the office of register of deeds of Washtenaw County, Michigan. Acceptance of this license shall in no way obligate the township to build, repair, maintain or clear the marginal service roads and no public funds may be spent by the township to build, repair, maintain or close the marginal service roads. The intent of this subsection is to require owners to construct a marginal service drive across the front of their property and to allow the township to enforce its traffic ordinances movement of traffic. All necessary pavement markings, signs and signals will be provided in accord with acceptable traffic engineering standards by the adjacent property owners. 
(9)	For any residential subdivision or site condo development, cluster housing or multiple-family development access shall be provided from a major or secondary thoroughfare by means of not less than two entrances (streets or drives) for properties of more than 700 feet in depth from such major or secondary thoroughfare or where a cluster housing or multiple-family development will contain more than 70 dwelling units.

Sec. 2125. Exterior building wall design.
The purpose of this section is to provide a set of exterior building wall material standards, the intent of which is to enhance the visual environment of the township. Furthermore, the review of exterior building wall design and the consistent administration of standards can help to maintain the township's sense of place by encouraging consistent quality and character when structures are built or redeveloped. 
1.	This section shall apply to all construction, except single family residential structures, for all exterior building walls and shall consist of those materials and combinations of materials as set forth in this section. 
2.	The use of exterior wall materials shall be in compliance with the maximum percentages permitted in the "Schedule Regulating Exterior Building Wall Materials." 
3.	The application of these standards should promote integration and mixture of materials where more than one material is used on a building. If only one material is used, architectural detailing and articulation, massing, texture and form must be introduced into the building's design. Building roof materials should be in harmony with the style and material used on the building walls. 
4.	When building walls are 100 feet or greater in length, design variations must be applied to assure that the building is not monotonous in appearance. Such variations include but are not limited to the following: 
a.	Recess and projections along the building facade. Variations in depth should be a minimum of ten feet. 
b.	Architectural details or features. 
c.	Enhanced ornamentation around building entryways. 
d.	Landscaping. 
e.	Streetscape elements. 
f.	Variations in building height. 
5.	When a particular building design and the materials or combination of materials proposed to be used in exterior walls are found by the planning commission, after consultation and review by an appropriate design professional, to be in keeping with the intent and purpose of this section, but which may differ from the strict application of the schedule regulating material use of this section (e.g., use of new materials not covered in the Building Wall Materials Schedule), the planning commission may waive the requirements of this section pertaining to materials. When a waiver is requested under this subsection, the proposed building design and materials schedule shall be accompanied by a written design statement which shall describe how the selected wall materials and material combinations will be consistent with and enhance the building design. 
6.	Where a new wall material is proposed for an existing building wall, only that portion of the building being altered shall be subject to the standards of this section. However, in considering the proposed alteration, the planning commission shall view it in context of the architecture of the entire building. 
7.	Where an addition is proposed to an existing building, the planning commission may allow the use of existing wall materials for the addition provided that the design of the alteration is consistent with the existing building wall design. 
8.	This section is not intended to regulate the quality, workmanship and requirements for materials relative to strength, durability and endurance, maintenance, performance, load capacity, or fire resistance characteristics.

(a)	An owner of land may voluntarily offer written conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a conditional rezoning is requested.

(b)	The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of conditional rezoning consideration, provided that any amended or additional conditions are entered voluntarily by the owner and confirmed in writing. An owner may withdraw in writing all or part of its offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of the township board, provided that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the planning commission's public hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be referred back to the planning commission for a new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation. 
(c)	The procedure for consideration of conditional rezoning request by the planning commission and township board shall be the same as provided in section 2702 for all other requests for amendments to the official zoning map. The following additional information shall also be required:

d.	A timeframe for completing the proposed improvements. 
e.	A legal description of the land. 
f.	A sketch plan in sufficient detail to illustrate any specific conditions proposed by the applicant. 
(2)	The notice of public hearing on a conditional rezoning request shall include a general description of the proposed agreement being considered. A review of the proposed agreement shall be conducted at the public hearing. 
(3)	A conditional rezoning may be approved upon the criteria set forth in section 2704 and a finding and determination that all of the following are satisfied: 
a.	The conditions, proposed development, and/or proposed use of the land are designed or proposed for public health, safety, and welfare purposes. 
b.	The conditions, proposed development and/or proposed use are not in material conflict with the master plan, or, if there is material conflict with the master plan, such conflict is due to one of the following: 
i.	A change in township policy since the master plan was adopted. 
ii.	A change in conditions since the master plan was adopted. 
iii.	An error in the master plan. 
c.	The conditions, proposed development and/or proposed use are in accordance with all terms and provisions of the zoning district to which the land is to be rezoned, except as otherwise allowed in the conditional rezoning agreement. 
d.	The conditions, proposed development and/or proposed use shall insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land. 
(d)	Upon approval by the township board of a conditional rezoning request and a conditional rezoning agreement, as provided by this section, the zoning map shall be amended to reflect a new zoning classification along with a relevant designation that will provide reasonable notice of the conditional rezoning agreement. 
(e)	A conditional rezoning approval shall expire following a period of time from the effective date of the rezoning established by the township board, unless progress has been diligently pursued and substantial completion has occurred in accordance with permits issued by the township. 
(1)	In the event the conditional rezoning expires, the rezoning and the conditional rezoning agreement shall be void and of no effect. 
(2)	If the conditional rezoning becomes void, no development shall be undertaken and no permits for development shall be issued until such time as a new zoning district classification of the property has become effective as a result of one or both of the following actions that may be taken: 
a.	The property owner seeks a new rezoning classification for the property; and/or 
b.	The township initiates a new rezoning request for the property to a reasonable district classification, in accordance with the conventional rezoning procedure. 
(f)	Recording. A conditional rezoning approval shall not become effective until the conditional rezoning agreement is recorded with the Washtenaw County Register of Deeds and a certified copy of the agreement is filed with the township clerk. 
(g)	Violation of conditional rezoning agreement. If development and/or actions are undertaken on or with respect to the property in violation of the conditional rezoning agreement, such development and/or actions shall constitute a violation of this ordinance and deemed a nuisance per se. In such case, the township may issue a stop work order relative to the property and seek any other lawful remedies. Until curative action is taken to bring the property into compliance with the conditional rezoning agreement, the township may withhold, or, following notice and an opportunity to be heard, revoke permits and certificates, in addition to or in lieu of such other lawful action to achieve compliance.

The township may not declare grantee's proposal unreasonable and deny renewal, nor may community needs be established, on the basis of facilities, equipment, or services which another party has indicated it is willing to provide. 
B.	In any renewal proceeding, the grantee shall be afforded adequate notice and the grantee and the township, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the fight to introduce evidence, to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding. 
C.	A proceeding under this subsection shall be completed within 12 months of its commencement, within which time the township shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the grantee.

E.	Grantee is expressly reserved its rights of appeal under federal and state law. In addition to such fights, this franchise shall remain in effect at all times during which a renewal proceeding or appeal remains pending.

G.

Township reserves the right to award additional franchises; provided, however, the township authority agrees to impose similar conditions on all companies offering the same service to the extent such companies are subject to the township's legal authority. Grantee' s corresponding obligations shall reflect terms and conditions which are no more burdensome and no less favored than those applied to any other grantee; and provided, that if township authorizes or permits another cable television system to operate within the township, it shall do so on condition that such cable television system indemnify and hold harmless the grantee from and against all costs and expenses incurred in strengthening poles, replacing poles, rearranging attachments, placing underground facilities, and all other costs including those of grantee, township, and utilities, incident to inspections, make ready, and construction of an additional cable television system in the franchise area; and provided further that grantee shall be designated a third party beneficiary of such conditions as are incorporated into the authorization(s) granted to another cable television system.

(1)	The Township Board will not review a preliminary plat until it has received the review and recommendations of the Commission. Following the receipt of such recommendations, the Township Board shall consider the preliminary plat at such meeting that the matter is placed on the regularly scheduled agenda. The Township Board shall take action on the preliminary plat within ninety (90) days of the date of initial filing, being the Planning Commission meeting that the proprietor first presents the preliminary plat for consideration. 
(2)	Should the Township Board tentatively approve the preliminary plat, they shall record their approval on the plat and return one copy to the proprietor. 
(3)	Tentative approval shall not constitute final approval of the preliminary plat. 
(4)	Tentative approval by the Township Board shall confer upon the proprietor for a period of twelve (12) months from date, approval of lot sizes, lot orientation, and street layout. Should the preliminary plat in whole or in part not be submitted for final approval within this time limit, the preliminary plat must again be submitted to the Commission and Township Board for approval unless an extension is applied for by the proprietor, and such request is granted in writing by the Township Board. 
(5)	No installation or construction of improvements shall be made on the basis of tentative approval of the preliminary plat including grading, tree removal or land balancing. 
03.05.02 Preliminary Plat Review by Township Board - Final Approval.
(a)	The proprietor shall file a valid preliminary plat, as tentatively approved by the Township Board, with the Clerk together with a certified list of all authorities required for approval in Sections 112 to 119 of the Land Division Act, including the following, where applicable. The proprietor shall also provide approved copies of plats from each of the required authorities along with any additional required information, application form, and fees: 
(1)	Washtenaw County Road Commission; 
(2)	Washtenaw County Drain Commission; 
(3)	Washtenaw County Health Department; 
(4)	Washtenaw County Plat Board; 
(5)	Michigan Department of Environmental Quality; 
(6)	Michigan Department of Commerce; 
(7)	Michigan Department of Public Health; 
(8)	Michigan Department of Transportation; 
(9)	Public utilities serving the area. 
(b)	The Township Planner and Engineer shall review the preliminary plat for final approval and make a recommendation to the Township Board. 
(c)	The Township Board shall take action on the preliminary plat at their next regular meeting or, within twenty (20) days of the submission of all necessary approved plats. 
(d)	If the preliminary plat conforms substantially to the plat tentatively approved by the Township Board and meets all conditions laid down for tentative approval, the Township shall give final approval to the preliminary plat. 
(e)	If the proprietor makes any major changes to the plat following tentative approval, the Township Board has the authority to require the proprietor to resubmit the plat for tentative approval to allow the Township and the public to respond to the changes. Major changes shall include, but not be limited to, the following changes: 
(1)	Adds lots to the plat; 
(2)	Deletes or adds a road or access point; 
(3)	Alters the basic layout of the street system; 
(4)	Significantly alters the previously approved topography or drainage plan; 
(5)	Eliminates or reduces recreational facilities; 
(6)	Alters the phasing by adding lots or extending streets beyond the maximum length permitted; 
(7)	Results in any lot or infrastructure element not meeting any Township Ordinance; 
(8)	Due to the location of utilities, there is a loss of natural features and landscaping that is not being replaced; or 
(9)	The boundaries of MDEQ regulated wetlands are changed to alter lot layout or road arrangement. 
Major changes made by the proprietor to the preliminary plat following tentative approval shall relieve the Township from its commitment to honor the general terms and conditions of the Tentative Preliminary Plat approval, since such major changes may result in changes to the basic premise on which the tentative approval was given. 
(f)	The Clerk shall promptly notify the proprietor of approval or rejection in writing; if rejected, reasons shall be given and shall be recorded in the minutes pertaining thereto. A copy of the minutes shall be sent to the proprietor. 
(g)	Final approval of the preliminary plat shall confer upon the proprietor for a period of two (2) years from date of approval, the conditional right that the general terms and conditions under which preliminary approval was granted will not be changed. The two (2) year period may be extended by the Township Board, if applied for and granted in writing. In determining whether to grant such extension, the Township Board shall consider whether the proprietor has been diligently carrying on construction of subdivision improvements towards completion and can reasonably be expected to complete such improvements within the extension time period. Written notice of the extension shall be sent by the Township Board to other approving authorities. 
(h)	No installation or construction of any improvements shall be made before the proprietor has met the following conditions: 
(1)	Final approval by Township Board of the preliminary plats. 
(2)	Approval by the Township Engineer of engineering plans which shall include the location of houses, wells and septic tanks or public water and sewer plans, plans for road construction including the top of the back slope of roads, lot grading and runoff pattern, and the location of all utilities. 
(3)	Deposits required under Article V, Improvements, of this Appendix, have been received by the Township. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
Sec. 03.06. Final plat.
The procedure for preparation and review of a final plat shall be as follows: 
03.06.01 Preparation.
(a)	The final plat shall comply with the provisions of the Land Division Act and Section 12 of the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act. 
(b)	The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved and it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the proprietor proposed to record and develop at the time; provided, however, that such portion conforms to this Subdivision Regulations Ordinance. In determining whether the final plat satisfies this criterion, the Township Board shall consider the following: 
(1)	A final plat shall be considered no longer substantially conforming to the final preliminary plat if any of the following revisions have been made: 
a.	An increase in the number of lots; 
b.	Realignment of proposed roads and intersections; 
c.	Change in the basic layout of the subdivision and lots. 
(2)	A final plat shall still be considered substantially conforming to the final preliminary plat if any of the following revisions have been made individually and not in combination with other revisions: 
a.	Decrease in the number of lots without changing the basic layout; 
b.	Revisions to horizontal or vertical alignment of streets to satisfy WCRC standards, provided that such revisions do not affect the overall arrangement of streets; 
c.	Adjustment to lot lines or setbacks due to a more precise wetland or floodplain boundary where such an adjustment has an insignificant impact on lot area, setbacks, or buffer zone requirements; 
d.	Change in location of monuments or lot markers to correct surveying errors; 
e.	Minor relocation of a stormwater detention or retention basin; 
f.	The addition of retaining walls. 
(c)	The proprietor shall submit as evidence of title, an abstract of title certified to date, with the written opinion of an attorney-at-law thereon, or at the option of the proprietor, policy of title insurance for examination in order to ascertain as to whether or not the proper parties have signed the plat. 
(d)	The proprietor shall have a survey that complies with Sections 125 and 126 of the Land Division Act. In instances where the Township Board waives the placing of the required monuments or markers the proprietor must place in escrow monies to insure the placing of monuments and markers within a specified time period not to exceed one (1) year. The amount to be placed in escrow shall be in accordance with Section 125(9) of the Land Division Act. 
(e)	As a condition of final plat approval, the Township Board of a municipality or the Board of County Road Commissioners may require copies of agreements, covenants, or other documents showing the manner in which areas to be reserved for the common use of the residents of the subdivision are to be maintained. 
(f)	The proprietor shall submit the final plat and as-built engineering plans, where required for approval, to obtain final approval signatures on the final plat mylar from the following agencies: 
(1)	Washtenaw County Drain Commission; 
(2)	Washtenaw County Road Commission; 
(3)	Michigan Department of Commerce; 
(4)	Michigan Department of Transportation (if applicable). 
03.06.02 Final plat review.
(a)	One (1) original mylar and six (6) paper prints of the final plat shall be filed by the proprietor with the Community & Economic Development Department and shall deposit such sums of money as the Township Board may require herein or by other ordinances. Such final plat shall have been processed in accord with Act 288 of 1967, Sections 162 through Section 165 prior to submission to the Township for its review. 
(b)	The final plat shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer and Township Planner as to compliance with the approved preliminary plat and plans for utilities and other improvements. 
(c)	The Township Board shall review all recommendations and take action on the final plat at their next regular meeting or, within twenty (20) days of its date of filing in accord with the procedures of Act 288 of 1967, Sections 166 through 167. 
(d)	Upon the approval of the final plat by the Township Board, the subsequent approvals shall follow the procedure set forth in the Land Division Act. The three (3) prints of the final plat shall be forwarded; one (1) to the Clerk, one (1) to the Planning Commission, and one (1) to the Community & Economic Development Department. The original shall be forwarded to the Clerk of the County Plat Board in accord with Act 288 of 1967, Section 168. A copy of the final plat CAD file shall be submitted to the Community and Economic Development Department on a suitable disk format, as determined by the Community and Economic Development Department. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
Sec. 03.07. Extension of review deadlines.
Deadlines for the Township to take action on a preliminary or final plat, as specified in the Land Division Act and reiterated in this Appendix, may be extended by mutual written consent of the proprietor and the Township Clerk. A waiver of the review deadlines may be required to permit concurrent processing of related review applications (i.e. PD rezoning). In the absence of written consent for such a waiver, denial of a plat shall be considered appropriate if the Township has not been given sufficient time within the deadline to evaluate the impact of a proposed plat on the public health, safety and welfare, pursuant to the regulations in this Appendix. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
Sec. 03.08. Coordination of rezoning or planned development with subdivision approval.
03.08.01 Rezoning required. No subdivision plat that requires a rezoning shall be considered prior to approval of the rezoning by the Township Board. 
03.08.02 Planned Development. A subdivision review may be conducted simultaneously with the review process for Planned Developments (PD) under the Zoning Ordinance. The plans required for the PD shall be submitted in a form to satisfy both the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and the Zoning Ordinance. In this process, following any public hearing required for the PD, the tentative preliminary plat may be processed following the PD Stage I rezoning. No subdivision plan that is being developed under PD shall be considered prior to approval of the PD Stage I rezoning by the Township Board. In selection of development under the PD district, the petitioner shall waive the review and approval deadlines for a subdivision plat specified in the Land Division Act or complete the PD Stage II approval prior to submitting a tentative preliminary plat. 
03.08.03 Issuance of permits. No building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until the Township has granted final approval of the zoning application and the final plat has been properly recorded. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
ARTICLE IV. DESIGN STANDARDS
The subdivision design standards set forth under this Section are development guides for the assistance of the proprietor. All final plans must be reviewed and approved by the Township Board. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
Sec. 04.01. Streets.
Streets shall conform to at least all minimum requirements of the general specifications and typical cross-sections as set forth in the Design Layout Standards Article of this Appendix, and other conditions set forth by the Township Board and Washtenaw County Road Commission. 
04.01.01 Location and Arrangements.
(a)	The proposed subdivision shall conform to the various elements of the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in relation to the existing and planned major thoroughfares and collector streets, and such part shall be platted in the location and the width indicated on such plan. 
(b)	The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new subdivisions, unless otherwise approved by the Township Board, following a recommendation by the Planning Commission, due to documented environmentally sensitive features, unusual lot configuration or unique site conditions. Where adjoining vacant areas are zoned or planned for development similar to the proposed subdivision, streets shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to make provision for the future street connections. The proprietor shall demonstrate that the proposed stub street is in a reasonable location for extension into the adjacent lands, in consideration of such factors as grades, water bodies, wetlands and lot configuration. A temporary cul-de-sac shall be provided unless the length of the stub street only abuts one (1) lot on either side. A sign shall be placed at the end of the stub street or cul-de-sac with a sign face on both sides stating "Future Street Extension." Stub roads for future road extensions shall be improved to the parcel line. 
(c)	Streets shall be aligned to maximize the preservation of natural features and existing grades to the extent feasible. Streets should follow natural topography to minimize grading. 
(d)	The proposed subdivision street layout shall discourage use by through traffic, except where a continuation of streets to adjoining properties is deemed desirable by the Township. In determining the need for such connections, the Township shall consider the need for adequate access and response time for emergency vehicles, the impacts such connections may have on reducing congestion along arterials, the projected traffic volumes and the compatibility with adjacent developments. 
(e)	Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain an existing or proposed major thoroughfare or collector, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with an approved screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line having a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation and reduction of traffic hazards. Vehicular driveway access shall be to a minor street. 
(f)	Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain a railroad, expressway, or other limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require the location of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the development of an appropriate use of the intervening land as for parks in residential districts. Such distances shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach grades to future grade separation. 
(g)	Half streets shall be prohibited, except where absolutely essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the parcel is adjacent to another platted and dedicated half street or when a contemporaneous development proposal includes the required adjacent half street. Wherever there exists, adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, a dedication or platted and recorded half street; the other half shall be platted. 
(h)	Where a subdivision incorporates existing public streets or private roads that are not in conformance with current standards, such facilities shall be reconstructed as necessary to improve the road to the extent required by the WCRC for public roads. 
04.01.02 Right-of-Way Widths: Street right-of-way widths shall conform to at least the following minimum requirements: 
	Street type 	Right-of-way widths 
a. 	Major Thoroughfare 	120;ft; or in conformance with the Washtenaw County Road Commission 
b. 	Collector Streets(Secondary Thoroughfares) 	86;ft; 
c. 	Industrial Service Streets 	66;ft; 
d. 	Industrial Collector Streets 	86;ft; 
e. 	Multiple-Family Residential Streets where Platted 	66;ft; 
f. 	Minor (Single-Family Residential) Streets 	66;ft; 
g. 	Marginal Access Streets 	60;ft; 
h. 	Turn-around (loop) Streets 	120;ft; 
i. 	Alleys 	30;ft; 
j. 	Cul-de-sac StreetsâTurn-Arounds 	75;ft; radius 
	(1)âIndustrial 	75;ft; radius 
	(2)âResidential and others 	75;ft; radius 

04.01.03 Cul-de-sacs. The length of cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet measured from the centerline of the street to the center point of the cul-de-sac, unless a longer street is necessitated by topography or other natural features, existing conditions or other circumstances as may be approved by the Township Board, based upon recommendation of the Planning Commission, and the WCRC. In all cases, however, at least two means of access shall be provided to serve a cul-de-sac having more than twenty (20) single-family lots or uses which would result in more than two hundred (200) trips per average weekday, based on the most recent edition of Trip Generation, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. In no case shall a dead end street be permitted. A temporary cul-de-sac may be utilized for a stub street where future access to an adjacent site is planned. 
04.01.04 Street Geometrics. Standards for maximum and minimum street grades, vertical and horizontal street curves and sight distances shall be established by the Township Engineer and the Washtenaw County Road Commission. Wherever feasible the natural features of the land shall be preserved by forming curvilinear streets. 
04.01.05 Street Grades. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall not be less than one-half percent for roads with curb and gutter and one (1) percent for roads with open ditches. The maximum street grade shall be six (6) percent for both roads with curb and gutter and with open ditches. In extraordinary circumstances a grade more extreme may be permitted providing a more efficient use of the land can be achieved, and upon approval of the Washtenaw County Road Commission. 
04.01.06 Curbs and Gutters. All roads shall be constructed with curb and gutters, in accordance with details and specifications prescribed by the Washtenaw County Road Commission. 
04.01.07 Street Intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible to ninety (90) degrees. Curved streets, intersecting with major thoroughfares and collector thoroughfares, shall do so with a tangent section of centerline sixty-five (65) feet in length measured from the right-of-way line of the major or collector thoroughfare. 
04.01.08 Location of entrances along Major Thoroughfares for large subdivisions. For streets which will potentially have average daily traffic volumes of over two thousand (2,000) trips during an average day or two hundred (200) trips during a peak hour, major entrances should be limited to the half mile or quarter mile points along major thoroughfares where there is potential for traffic signalization in the future. Deviations from this standard shall be permitted if needed to provide adequate sight distance or if a modification is supported by a traffic impact study provided by the proprietor. 
04.01.09 Straightaways. Long, generally straight roadways that encourage high vehicular speeds through subdivisions should be avoided. 
04.01.10 Spacing of intersections along Major Thoroughfares. Streets intersecting along major thoroughfares shall be spaced at least three hundred (300) feet from the intersection of another platted street on the same side of the street, and spaced at least six hundred sixty (660) feet where possible. In addition, streets crossing major thoroughfares shall cross in direct alignment. Where direct alignment is not possible, streets on opposite sides of a major thoroughfare shall be offset no less than two hundred fifty (250) feet to each other, unless the Planning Commission and Township Board determine that a lesser offset is justified because of numerous existing streets or the difficulty of providing adequate site distance with a different alignment. 
04.01.11 Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. 
04.01.12 Grading and Centerline Gradients. Per plans and profiles approved by the Township Engineer and Washtenaw County Road Commission. 
04.01.13 Acceleration-Deceleration Lanes. Streets that intersect with major or secondary thoroughfares shall be provided with paved acceleration and deceleration lanes. Left turn passing lanes shall be provided if warranted based upon WCRC standards. Such lanes shall be provided in keeping with the standards approved by the Township Engineer and Washtenaw County Road Commission for this type of improvement. 
04.01.14 Street names. Street names shall be sufficiently distinct from other street names in the area to avoid confusion, particularly for emergency service providers. Proposed street names shall be accepted by the Township and approved by the WCRC as a part of the preliminary plat approval process. Any proposed roadway that is an extension of, or in a direct line with, an existing street shall carry the name of the street that is in existence at the time the proposal is made. 
04.01.15 Signs. The developer shall be responsible for placement of street name signs at all street intersections in accordance with the requirements of the WCRC. Where roads are proposed to be dedicated to the county, the WCRC may install the signs at the developer's expense. The developer shall also be responsible for placement of pavement markings and regulatory street signs (such as no parking signs, stop or yield signs, speed limit signs, and warning signs) as requested by the Township, the WCRC or the MDOT. All regulatory signs shall be in conformance with the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, most current edition. 
04.01.16 Phasing. Each phase of the plat shall be designed to meet the street requirements above, regardless of whether future phases are constructed. 
04.01.17 Street Pavement Width Standards. All newly constructed streets shall comply with the standards listed below. The Township Board may allow a reduction in these standards subject to approval by the Planning Commission. 
	Street type 	Pavement width 
(measured from back-to-back of curb) 
a. 	Major Thoroughfare 	In conformance with the standards and specifications established by the Washtenaw County Road Commission. This width is generally established as 30 feet.

(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
Sec. 04.02. Blocks.
Blocks within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards: 
04.02.01 Length. Blocks or the length of any street constructed for any phase of a subdivision shall be no more than one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) feet, except in subdivisions developed with lots of greater than one hundred (100) foot lot width the Township Board may allow block lengths up to one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet. The Township Board, upon recommendation from the Planning Commission, may approve a plat which varies from these dimensions if there is documented evidence that significant natural features will be preserved or stub streets to connect to vacant land are being provided which will result in a conforming condition in the future, and the WCRC approves the layout. 
04.02.02 Width. Widths of blocks shall be determined by the condition of the layout and shall be suited to the intended layout. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00)
 
Sec. 04.03. Lots.
Lots within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards: 
04.03.01 General lot arrangement.
(a)	Through lots (lots with frontage on two parallel streets) are prohibited, except in the case of a reverse frontage lot that abuts a major thoroughfare where access to such major thoroughfare is prohibited. 
(b)	Lots facing a three-way intersection shall be aligned to prevent oncoming headlight glare into the living area of the building envelope. 
(c)	Blocks shall be so designed as to provide two (2) tiers of back-to-back lots, except where lots back onto a major thoroughfare, railroad, natural feature or subdivision boundary. 
(d)	Corner lots shall have access to the lesser traveled roadway. 
(e)	No more than fifty (50) percent of the perimeter of a lot shall front along a public street right-of-way or private road access easement. 
(f)	If the plat extends into an adjacent community, boundaries for individual lots shall be within one (1) community to the extent feasible. In no case shall a building envelope result in a situation where a home crosses a community or school district boundary. 
(g)	If the subdivision includes any outlots or excepted parcels, an illustration shall be provided to demonstrate that the remaining land can be used or subdivided in conformance with Township standards. 
(h)	A minimum of forty percent (40%) of residential units shall utilize side-entry garages, rear-entry detached garages accessed from a common alley, or recessed garages where the front of the garage is set back a minimum of five feet (5') from the front building line of the dwelling. 
04.03.02 Sizes and Shapes.
(a)	The lot size, width, depth and shape in any subdivision proposed for residential uses shall be appropriate for the location and the type of development contemplated. 
(b)	Lot areas and widths shall conform to at least the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which the subdivision is proposed. 
(c)	Building setback lines shall conform to at least the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(d)	Areas of the subdivision plat that contain ponds, lakes, creeks or similar bodies of water shall be recorded as acreage, but shall not be platted as subdivision lots nor calculated as a portion of the minimum lot area as required by the Zoning Ordinance. 
(e)	A maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum required lot area may be wetlands regulated by the MDEQ. This requirement may be modified by the Township Board, upon a recommendation from the Planning Commission, if the proprietor successfully demonstrates that a building envelope can easily be accommodated on the lot without intruding into the required water features setback, and that provisions have been made to help ensure the long term protection of the wetland. These protection measures could include a physical barrier, conservation easement, deed restriction, or similar technique. 
(f)	Corner lots in residential subdivisions shall be platted at least ten (10) feet wider than the minimum width permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. 
(g)	Excessive lot depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A depth-to-width ratio of 3 to 1 shall normally be considered a maximum. 
(h)	Lots shall be of sufficient size and proportion to accommodate at least the minimum required building setbacks listed in Section 2000 of the Zoning Ordinance, Schedule of Regulations, for the district in which the subdivision is located. 
(i)	Lots intended for purposes other than residential use shall be specifically designed for such purposes, and shall have adequate provision for off-street parking and loading, setbacks and other requirements in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance. 
(j)	Lots that abut an active rail line shall have minimum depth of two hundred fifty (250) feet to provide a minimum seventy-five (75) foot setback from the railroad right-of-way line. 
04.03.03 Arrangement.
(a)	Every lot shall front on, and have direct access to, a public street approved by WCRC or private road approved by the Township, with vehicular access restricted only to a minor street. In addition, the driveways for all corner lots shall access the most interior, or less traveled, street within the subdivision. 
(b)	Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles or radial to the street centerlines. This requirement shall not apply where such lot lines would create irregularly shaped lots which would unreasonably limit construction, or where adjustments to the standard lot configuration would protect regulated wetlands or preserve other natural features, such as topography. "Dogleg" side lot lines that create irregularly shaped lots shall be avoided. 
(c)	Residential lots abutting major thoroughfares or collector streets, shall be platted so that driveways shall access the interior road network. 
(d)	Lots shall have a front-to-front relationship across all streets where possible. 
(e)	Where lots border upon bodies of water the front yard may be designed as the waterfront side of such lot provided the lot has sufficient depth to provide adequate setback on the street side to maintain a setback for all structures equal to the front setback on the street side as well as on the waterfront side. The Planning Commission shall review and approve any deviation from minimum requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2000-243, 3-7-00; Ord. No. 2001-274, 7-17-01)
 
Sec. 04.04. Sidewalks, Pedestrian Through-Block Connectors and Bikepaths.
04.04.01 Requirement. Sidewalks or bikepaths shall be required for any subdivision plat under the following circumstances: 
(a)	Sidewalks. Five (5) foot sidewalks shall be provided on one or both sides of all streets or roads internal to the subdivision. 
(b)	Very Low Density. The Township Board, based upon a recommendation by the Planning Commission, may eliminate the sidewalk requirement for very low density development where all lots within the subdivision are greater than one (1) acre in area. Another type of paved pedestrian trail system shall be provided by the developer. 
(c)	Bikepaths. Ten (10) foot wide bikepaths shall be provided along county primary roads where designated on the nonmotorized pathway plan contained in the Comprehensive Plan. 
(d)	Through-block Connectors. Pedestrian through-block connectors may be required in the middle of any block over 1,000 feet in length to obtain satisfactory pedestrian circulation within the subdivision, to provide access to parks or open space, to provide links with an adjacent subdivision, or to provide access to an activity center. Where such pedestrian through-block connectors are required, an easement at least twenty (20) feet wide shall be provided. The Township may require placement of a fence along the easement to ensure the location is visible and to protect the adjacent property owners. 
(e)	Other Locations. The Planning Commission may require a pedestrian pathway in other locations in order to meet the intent of this Section. 
(f)	Performance Guarantee. A performance guarantee, in lieu of sidewalk/pathway construction, may be required by the Planning Commission in instances where significant site constraints such as water features or significant grade changes to adjacent undeveloped property or when utility and other infrastructure improvements are planned for the site in the near future. Under these circumstances, the sidewalk/pathway shall be constructed once the site constraint can be eliminated. 
04.04.02 Construction Standards. The following construction standards shall apply to all pedestrian facilities: 
(a)	All sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide concrete and constructed to the specifications set by the Township Engineer. 
(b)	All bikepaths shall be at least ten (10) feet wide asphalt and constructed in accordance with the specifications set by the Township Engineer. 
(c)	All other pathways located within open space areas or are designated pedestrian through-block connectors shall be at least five (5) feet wide asphalt and constructed in accordance with the specifications set by the Township Engineer. The Township Board may approve stone paths or wooden boardwalks in areas with sensitive environmental features. 
(d)	Sidewalks and bike paths shall be installed by the developer within the dedicated street right-of-way or private road access easements. Special easements shall be established where grades or other factors prevent placement within the right-of-way or access easement. 
(e)	Any yard that abuts a pedestrian easement shall provide the required minimum building setback, as applicable, from the easement. 
(f)	Grades shall be clearly illustrated on the plans to insure proper connection to sidewalks and bikepaths on adjacent lands.
