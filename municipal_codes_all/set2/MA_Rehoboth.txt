Town Meetings; provided, however, that any lesser number may take action on any article not requiring the raising
and appropriating or transfer of money, and, also, to adjourn the meeting from time to time.
Section 2. The conduct of all Town Meetings not prescribed by law or by these By-Laws shall be determined by the
Rules and Practices contained in TOWN MEETING TIME, A HANDBOOK OF PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE,
second edition by Johnson, Trustman, and Wadsworth, revised and amended in 1984 by Copeland, Harrington,
Howard, Kirkpatrick and Nichols, as far as applicable and not inconsistent with the By-Laws of the town.
(Amended/Effective 6/8/1985)
Section 3. No person whose name is not on the list of voters shall be admitted to any Town Meeting except by written
request of a majority of the Selectmen to the Moderator or by the Moderator. Such person(s) shall be called to the
attention of the voters present.
Section 4. These By-Laws may be repealed or amended by a majority vote at an Annual Town Meeting, or by a twothirds
vote at a Special Town Meeting where 75 voters are present, but in no case unless the particular By-Law to be
repealed or amended is specified in the Town Meeting warrant.
Section 5. Articles in the warrant shall be acted upon in their order, unless the meeting by majority vote determines
otherwise.
Section 6. Every person desiring to speak shall arise, address the Chair, first obtain recognition and stand while
speaking, unless the Moderator directs otherwise.
Section 7. No person shall be heard for the second time on any subject if there are other voters who desire to be heard
but have not been heard on the same subject, except for answering at the Moderator' s discretion.
Section 8. Whenever the voice or hand vote at Town Meeting, after declaration by the Moderator, shall be immediately
questioned by seven or more voters (who shall stand), the vote will then be taken by hand count by sworn tellers
appointed by the Moderator for the Meeting or by ballot vote at the direction of the Moderator. A ballot may also be
required by a majority vote on motion properly made and seconded.
Section 9. A motion to reconsider any vote must be made before the final adjournment of the Meeting at which the
vote was passed. The Moderator shall not permit a motion to reconsider, unless in the sole opinion of the Moderator,
the moving party demonstrates that the motion to reconsider is based upon new information that had not previously
been presented to the Town Meeting under the original consideration of the article. Such motion to reconsider shall
not be made at an adjourned meeting unless the mover has given notice if his intention to make such a motion, either
at the session of the meeting at which the vote was passed, or by written notice to the Town Clerk within forty-eight
hours after the adjournment of such session. There can be no reconsideration of a vote once reconsidered. (Amended
Effective 11-20-14)
Section 10. No article on the warrant shall again be taken under consideration after it has been disposed of by vote,
unless ordered by vote of two-thirds of the voters present.
Section 11. No motion, the effect of which would be to dissolve a Town Meeting, shall be in order until every article
in the warrant has been duly considered and acted upon. This shall not prevent postponement of action to an adjourned
meeting at a stated time and place.

L-14
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan: The Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall contain
sufficient information to describe the nature and purpose of the proposed development,
pertinent conditions of the site and the adjacent areas, and proposed erosion and
sedimentation controls. The design requirements of the Erosion and Sediment Control
Plan are to:
1. Minimize total area of disturbance;
2. Sequence activities to minimize simultaneous areas of disturbance;
3. Minimize peak rate of runoff in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater
Policy;
4. Minimize soil erosion and control sedimentation during construction, provided
that prevention of erosion is preferred over sedimentation control;
5. Maximize groundwater recharge;
6. Install and maintain all Erosion and Sediment Control measures in accordance
with the manufacturers specifications and good engineering practices;
7. Prevent off-site transport of sediment;
8. Protect and manage on and off-site material storage areas (overburden and
stockpiles of dirt, borrow areas, or other areas used solely by the permitted project
are considered a part of the project);
9. Comply with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations including
waste disposal, septic system regulations, and air quality requirements, including
dust control;
10. Prevent significant alteration of habitats mapped by the Massachusetts Natural
Heritage & Endangered Species Program as Endangered, Threatened or Of Special
Concern, Estimated Habitats of Rare Wildlife and Certified Vernal Pools, and
Priority Habitats of Rare Species from the proposed activities;

on a disturbed area as soon as practicable but no more than 14 days after
construction activity has temporarily or permanently ceased on that portion of the
site;
12. Properly manage on-site construction and waste materials; and
13. Prevent off-site vehicle tracking of sediments.
Stormwater Management Plan: Projects shall meet the Standards of the Massachusetts
Stormwater Management Policy, which are as follows:
1. No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated
stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or water of the
Commonwealth.
L-15
2. Stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development
peak discharge rates do not exceed pre-development peak discharge rates.
3. Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of
infiltration measures to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge
from the post-development site should approximate the annual recharge rate from
the pre-development or existing site conditions, based on soil types.
4. For new development, stormwater management systems must be designed to
remove 80% of the average annual load (post development conditions) of Total
Suspended Solids (TSS). It is presumed that this standard is met when:
a. Suitable nonstructural practices for source control and pollution prevention
are implemented;
b. Stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) are sized to
capture the prescribed runoff volume; and
c. Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed.
5. Stormwater discharges from areas with higher potential pollutant loads require
the use of specific stormwater management BMPs. The use of infiltration practices
without pretreatment is prohibited.
6. Stormwater discharges to critical areas must utilize certain stormwater
management BMPs approved for critical areas. Critical areas are Outstanding
Resource Waters (ORWs), shellfish beds, swimming beaches, cold water fisheries
and recharge areas for public water supplies.
7. Redevelopment of previously developed sites must meet the Stormwater
Management Standards to the maximum extent practicable. However, if it is not
practicable to meet all the Standards, new (retrofitted or expanded) stormwater
management systems must be designed to improve existing conditions.
Operations and Maintenance Plan: An Operation and Maintenance plan (O&M Plan) is
required at the time of application for all projects. The maintenance plan shall be designed
to ensure compliance with the Permit, this Bylaw and that the Massachusetts Surface
Water Quality Standards, 314 CMR 4.00 are met in all seasons and throughout the life of
the system. The Administrating Authority shall make the final decision of what
maintenance option is appropriate in a given situation. The Administrating Authority
will consider natural features, proximity of site to water bodies and wetlands, extent of
impervious surfaces, size of the site, the types of stormwater management structures, and
potential need for ongoing maintenance activities when making this
decision. The approved Operation and Maintenance Plan shall remain on file with the
Administrating Authority, shall be prepared in compliance with and recorded at the
Bristol County Northern District Registry of Deeds, and shall be an ongoing requirement.
The O&M Plan shall include:
1. The name(s) of the owner(s) for all components of the system;
L-16
2. The signature(s) of the owner(s);
3. Maintenance agreements that specify:
a. The names and addresses of the person(s) responsible for operation and
maintenance;
b. The person(s) responsible for financing maintenance and emergency
repairs;
4. A Maintenance Schedule for all drainage structures, including swales and ponds;
5. Identification, purpose and recordable meet-and-bound descriptions of all
stormwater management easements located on-site and/or off-site as necessary
for:
a. access for facility inspections and maintenance;
b. preservation of stormwater runoff conveyance, infiltration, and detention
areas and facilities, including flood routes for the 100-year storm event;
c. direct maintenance access by heavy equipment to structures requiring
regular cleanout;
Section 11. Enforcement
The Administrating Authority or an authorized agent of the Administrating Authority
shall enforce this by-law, regulations, orders, violation notices, and enforcement orders,
and may pursue all civil remedies for such violations.
Orders: The Administrating Authority or an authorized agent of the Administrating
Authority may issue a written order to enforce the provisions of this by-law or the
regulations thereunder, which may include:
1. a requirement to cease and desist until there is compliance with the bylaw;
2. repair, maintenance, installation or performance of additional erosion and
sediment control measures;
3. monitoring, analyses, and reporting; and/or
4. remediation of erosion and sedimentation.
If the enforcing person determines that abatement or remediation of erosion and
sedimentation is required, the order shall set forth a deadline by which such abatement
or remediation must be completed. Said order shall further advise that, should the
violator or property owner fail to abate or perform remediation within the specified
L-17
deadline, the Town of Rehoboth may, at its option, undertake such work, and the
property owner shall reimburse the Town of Rehoboth’s expenses.
Within thirty (30) days after completing all measures necessary to abate the violation or
to perform remediation, the violator and the property owner shall be notified of the costs
incurred by the Town of Rehoboth, including administrative costs. The violator or
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount or basis of costs with
the Stormwater Management Committee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
notification of the costs incurred. If the amount due is not received by the expiration of
the time in which to file a protest or within thirty (30) days following a decision of the
Stormwater Management Committee affirming or reducing the costs, or from a final
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the costs shall become a special assessment
against the property owner and shall constitute a lien on the owner’s property for the
amount of said costs. Interest shall begin to accrue on any unpaid costs at the statutory
rate, as provided in G.L. Ch. 59, § 57, after the thirty-first day following the day on which
the costs were due.

101 Authorities
101.1 Under the authority vested in the Planning Board of the Town of Rehoboth by Section 81
Q of Chapter 41 of the General Laws, said Board hereby adopts these Rules and
Regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town of Rehoboth, effective August
14, 1947. Rules and Regulations have been amended on the following dates: December
22, 1966, October 28, 1971, November 20, 1974, September 2, 1987, April 20, 1988,
September 28, 1988, December 7, 1988, January 24, 1990, December 27, 1990, March 26,
1997, April 24, 1997, June 19, 2000 and July 9, 2001, October 3, 2007, March 12, 2008,
April 17, 2013, May 20, 2015.
102 Purposes
102.1 These Rules and Regulations have been enacted for the purpose of protecting the safety,
convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of Rehoboth, by regulating the
laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots
therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in
subdivisions and in proper cases, parks and open areas. The powers of a Planning Board
and of a Board of Appeals under the subdivision control law shall be exercised with due
regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that
will be safe and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the
adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor
vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic, and other emergencies; for
insuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or by-laws; for securing
adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage, underground utility services, fire, police,
and other similar municipal equipment, and street lighting and other requirements where
necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other
and with the public ways in the Town of Rehoboth and with the ways in neighboring
subdivisions. Such powers may also be exercised with due regard for the policy of the
Commonwealth to encourage the use of solar energy and protect the access to direct
sunlight of solar energy systems. It is the intent of these Rules and Regulations that any
subdivision filed with the Planning Board shall receive the approval of such board if said
plan conforms to the recommendations of the Board of Health and to these Rules and
Regulations of the Planning Board Governing the Subdivision of Land; provided, however,
that The Planning Board may, when appropriate, waive, as provided in Section 81 R of
Chapter 41 of the General Laws, such portions of these Rules and Regulations as the
Planning Board deems advisable.

SECTION 300 PRELIMINARY PLANS
301 Purposes
301.1 It is very strongly recommended that a Preliminary Plan be filed in every case, allowing
the Boards and Commissions forty-five (45) days in which to study the plan and to make
recommendations toward the preparation of the Definitive Plan. A Preliminary Plan of a
subdivision may be submitted by the applicant to the Planning Board, Board of Health and
Conservation Commission for discussion and approval, modification or disapproval by any
of the Boards or Commissions. The submission of the Preliminary Plan will enable the
applicant, the Boards, Commissions, other town agencies and owners of property abutting
the subdivision to discuss and clarify the problems of such subdivision before costly
engineering drawings for a Definitive Plan are prepared. The applicant may thus avoid the
expense and delays which may be necessitated by changes in a Definitive Plan.
302 Submissions
302.1 An applicant submitting a Preliminary Plan shall file a properly executed copy of a Form B
and fifteen (15) prints of the plan with the Planning Board, one copy with Board of Health
and one copy with the Conservation Commission. The applicant shall file by delivery or
registered mail a notice with the Town Clerk stating the date of submission for such
approval of a Preliminary Plan and accompanied by a copy of the completed application
(Form B).
302.2 A preliminary plan of a subdivision may be submitted by the applicant for discussion,
modification, approval, conditional approval or disapproval by the Board. The applicant
shall demonstrate ownership of the fee interest on the land in question or else document
that he/she is acting as the duly authorized agent of said owner by means of a notarized
letter so stating. Any change deemed to be significant by the Planning Board, such as a
new roadway location or connection, shall require a new submission and filing fee. The
Board may, at its discretion, waive filing fees where changes to plans are required through
circumstances beyond the control or design responsibility of the applicant.
303 Contents
303.1 The Preliminary Plan so titled shall be drawn at a scale of one (1) inch to each forty (40)
feet or at a scale approved by the Planning Board. Said Preliminary Plan should show
sufficient information about the subdivision to form a clear basis for discussion of its
problems and for the preparation of the Definitive Plan. The plan shall be prepared by an
Engineer and Land Surveyor registered in Massachusetts, shall be clearly and legibly

Health two contact prints of the Definitive Plan, dark line on white background. The
Board of Health shall within forty-five days after filing of the plan, report to the Planning
Board in writing, approval or disapproval of said plan. If the Board of Health disapproves
said plan, it shall make specific findings as to which, if any, of the lots shown on such plan
cannot be used for building sites without injury to the public health, and include such
specific findings and the reasons therefore in such report, and where possible, shall make
recommendations for the adjustment thereof. Every lot (so located that it cannot be served
by a connection to the municipal sewer system) shall be provided with a septic tank and

a public hearing shall be held by the Planning Board, notice of the time and place of which
and of the subject matter, sufficient for identification, shall be given by the Planning Board
at the expense of the applicant by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in
the city or town once in each of two successive weeks, the first publication being not less
than fourteen days before the day of such a hearing or if there is no such newspaper in such
a city or town then by posting such notice in a conspicuous place in the city or town hall
building for a period of not less than fourteen (14) days before the day of such a hearing,
and by mailing a copy of such advertisement to the applicant and to all the owners of land
abutting upon the land included in such plan as appearing on the most recent tax list.
406.2 In cases where the Planning Board feels it would be an aid in explaining a proposed
sub-division to the public, the Board may require the subdivider to furnish scale 3
Dimensional contour model of the site before and after development. These models would
be made to the specifications and scales approved by the Board and might require in some
cases the inclusion of abutting property. The models would become the property of the
Planning Board.
407 Performance Guarantee
407.1 Before endorsement of its approval or conditional approval of a Definitive Plan for a
subdivision, the Planning Board shall require security for the construction of ways and
installation of municipal services in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Board. Such construction and installation shall be secured by one, or in part by one and in
part by another, of the methods described in Section 407.1.01 and Section 407.1.02, which
may be selected and from time to time varied by the applicant with the approval of the
Board.
.01 Approval of Bond with Surety or Money or Negotiable Securities-bond or a deposit
of money or negotiable securities (i.e. Form G - Performance Secured by Deposit of
Money; Form H - Performance Secured by Surety Company; Form I - Performance
Secured by Registered Negotiable Securities; Form J - Performance Secured by
Bank Passbook; or Form K - Performance Secured by Lender's Agreement) in an
amount determined by the Board to be sufficient to cover the cost of all of the
improvements as specified in Section 600, REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS FOR
AN APPROVED SUBDIVISION, the maintenance cost of such improvement for
two years and a ten percent (10%) contingency factor shall be required. Detailed
cost estimates for all improvements shall be submitted by the applicant's professional
engineer for review. If said estimates are found by the Board and its engineer to be
18
unsatisfactorily low, a revised estimate satisfactory to the Board will be required.
Such bond or security, if filed or deposited, shall be approved as to form and manner
of execution by the Board and as to sureties by the Town Accountant, and shall not
expire until released by the Board. Upon the completion of the subdivision, in full
compliance with the plans and conditions, the Board will release the Performance
Guarantee in part, retaining up to ten percent (10%) of the Performance Guarantee
for a period of two (2) years or until the roads are accepted at Town Meeting,
whichever is earlier. The penal sum of any such bond, or the amount of any deposit
held above may, from time to time, be reduced by the Board and obligations of the
parties thereto released in whole or in part.
.02 Approvals by Covenant - (i.e. Form F - Covenant) Instead of filing a bond with
surety or depositing money or negotiable securities or providing a lender agreement,
the applicant may provide covenant restrictions. Such covenant, executed and duly
recorded at the Bristol County Registry of Deeds, Northern District or at the Bristol
County Northern District Division of Land Court, as the case may be by owner of
record, running with the land, shall provide that construction of ways and installation
of municipal services shall be provided for the entire subdivision before any lot may
be built upon or conveyed. Such a covenant shall comply with M.G.L. Ch 41, Sec
81U as amended. Any covenant given shall be either inscribed on the plan or
contained in a separate document referred to on the plan. Upon the completion of
the subdivision, in full compliance with the plans and conditions, the Board will
release the Covenant upon the prior deposit of money with the Board with a
completed Form G (Performance Secured by Deposit of Money) sufficient in an
amount, in the opinion of the Planning Board's Consulting Engineer, to cover the
possible repairs to the subdivision for two (2) years or until the roads are accepted at
the Town Meeting, whichever is earlier.
407.2 When the Developer requests the early release of a covenant, before the total completion of
the subdivision, the Board may, at its discretion, release the covenant upon receipt by the
Board a satisfactory performance security as specified under M.G.L. Sect. 81 U sufficient,
in the opinion of the Planning Board's Consulting Engineer, to cover the cost of
completing the subdivision per approved plans and conditions and to cover the cost of
possible repairs, for the following two (2) years, or until the roads are accepted at the
Town Meeting, whichever is earlier.
408 Minor Changes, Plan Revisions, Incomplete Submissions
408.1 Definitive Plans submitted to the Planning Board for review under the Town Clerk's stamp
may not be revised without the consent of the Board, and only as discussed during a public
session. Any such changes shall be prominently noted on the plan set cover sheet, and on
any individual sheets affected to as to make clear the plan of record on which the action of
the Board is being requested.
408.2 The Board reserves the right to disapprove incomplete submissions prior to posting of a
public hearing or at any time up to the closing of the public hearing unless, in its opinion,
review of the plan is not hampered by the absence of required information. In the event of
such disapproval, the plans shall be returned to the applicant, and a copy of the Certificate
of Disapproval filed with the Town Clerk noting the reason for the Board's action. The
Planning Board reserves the right to retain any filing and review fees, or to reimburse any
portion of such fees to the applicant, based on the extent to which the review has
proceeded and to cover administrative costs of filing, notification, distribution, etc
19
409 Certificate of Approval, Modification, or Disapproval
409.1 The action of the Planning Board in respect to such plan as to approval, modification or
disapproval thereof shall be by vote, copies of which shall be certified and filed with the
Town Clerk and sent by delivery or registered mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant. If
the Board modifies or disapproves such plan, it shall state in its vote the reasons for its
action. Final approval, if granted, shall be endorsed on the original drawing of the
Definitive Plan by the signatures of a majority of the Planning Board but not until the
statutory twenty (20) day appeal period has elapsed following the filing of the Certificate
of Action of the Planning Board with the Town Clerk, and said Clerk has notified the
Planning Board that no appeal has been filed. The Town Clerk shall endorse the plan and
refer to on said plan the fact that there was no notice of appeal received during the twenty
(20) day appeal period. Definitive plans evolved from the submission of a preliminary
plan, which has received approval, with or without modifications, shall be governed by the
rules and regulations relative to subdivision control law in effect at the time of submission
of the preliminary plan, provided that the definitive plan is duly submitted within seven (7)
months from the date on which the preliminary plan was submitted. Failure of the Board
to take final action regarding a plan submitted to it within ninety (90) days after such
submission, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the
applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval thereof. After the Definitive Plan has been
approved and endorsed, the applicant shall furnish the Board with four (4) prints thereof.
409.2 Final approval of the Definitive Plan does not constitute the laying out or acceptance by
the Town of streets within a subdivision.
409.3 Unless otherwise specifically provided, in the conditions of approval, the subdivision plan
must be completed within a two-year period from the date of such approval and if a
development is not completed in its entirety in that time, the applicant must again petition
the Board for action on the undeveloped portion.
410 Prohibited Activities
410.1 After the submission of a Form B or Form C no site preparation, tree cutting, filling,
excavation and other work done in anticipation of the subdivision plan approval shall be
performed prior to the submission and approval of a definitive plan. The Planning Board
reserves the right to disapprove any such work, to order restoration of the site, and to
assess fines as provided for in these regulations or by Massachusetts General Law upon
filing a Form A, Preliminary or Definitive Plan application.
411 On-Site Inspections
411.1 The applicant/developer is responsible for requesting inspection at the proper stages in the
process of installation of improvements. The applicant shall obtain a copy of Form N and
it shall be the applicant's responsibility to secure the signature of the inspector (see Section
704 Inspection), at the appropriate time in the construction process.
411.2 Should an inspection not be performed due to the failure of the applicant/developer to
notify the inspector, (see Section 704 Inspection), the applicant will be required to uncover
the improvements. No work will be accepted that has been covered before inspection.
Proper notice is required.
20
411.3 The applicant/developer shall submit a Form N to the Planning Board, complete with the
date and signature of the appropriate inspector (Planning Board's Consulting Engineer,
Highway Superintendent, and Fire Chief) noted on the form for the purpose of verifying
the completion of any and all phases of construction.
412 Certificate of Completion
412.1 Upon completion of the construction of ways and installation of services in accordance
with the Rules and Regulations of the Board, security for the performance of which was
given by Section 408.1.01 and/or Section 408.1.02, or upon the performance of any
covenant with respect to any lot, the applicant shall submit "as-built" drawings of all
utilities and drainage systems to the Boards and a written statement in duplicate to the
Town Clerk, containing the address of the applicant and the Town Clerk shall furnish the
Planning Board with one copy of the above statement with a notice provided by the
applicant from the Bristol Registry of Deeds verifying that the plan has been recorded in a
Book and Page number format, and the date the plan was recorded. If the Board is
satisfied that all requirements have been met, it shall release the interest of the Town in
such bond and return the bond or the deposit to the person who furnished same, or release
the covenant by appropriate instruments (a completed Form O - Certificate of
Completion - Release of Municipal Interest), duly acknowledged, which may be recorded.
412.2 If it is determined that the necessary work has not been completed, the Board shall so
notify the applicant in writing specifying the details. Failure of the Board to so notify the
applicant within forty-five (45) days after the receipt by the Town Clerk will cause all
obligations under the bond to cease and terminate by operation of law. Any deposits shall
be returned and any covenant shall become void.
412.3 If the forty-five (45) day period expires without such specifications, or without release and
return of the bond or return of the deposit or release of the covenant, the Town Clerk shall
issue a certificate to such effect, duly acknowledged which may be recorded.
412.4 No building permit shall be issued by the Inspector of Buildings for a lot within a
subdivision that is secured by covenant until the Board has released such lot. Further, no
building permit shall be issued by the Inspector of Buildings for a lot within a subdivision
which is subject to a Schedule of Development until a release has been granted by the
Board pursuant to the Schedule of Development Zoning By-Law.

.10 The minimum cover is 18 inches below the bottom of stabilized subgrade for
HS-25 Live Loads (from 18” to 42” Pipe Diameters) and 24 inches below the
bottom of stabilized subgrade for larger diameter structures (from 48” to 60”
Pipe Diameters). It is recommended that all pipes shall be placed a minimum
of 24 inches below the bottom of stabilized subgrade in order to reduce the
potential for conflicts with other utility systems. Variances from the minimum
cover requirement must be submitted in writing to the Board and approved by
the Board’s Engineer prior to commencing construction. Extreme care should
be taken when heavy construction equipment loads cross the pipe trench
during construction. If the passage of construction equipment over an installed
pipeline is necessary during construction, compacted fill in the form of a ramp
shall be constructed to a minimum elevation of three (3.0’) feet over the top of

Section 30) may require replacement or re-compaction at the contractor’s
expense when measured or inspected not less than 30 days following
completion of installation. Deflection is defined per ASTM D 2321. The
Contractor shall provide Video Camera (CCTV) inspection on 100% of the
pipelines installed. The test shall be conducted at least 30 days after the
installation of the pipeline. Mandreling of the pipe may be accepted as a
suitable alternative for pipeline inspection and deflection testing, in lieu of
CCTV inspection, with the permission of the Board.
.12 Joints shall be installed such that the connection of pipe sections will form a
continuous line free from irregularities in the flow line. All installations shall
require watertight joints that meet a 74kPa (10.8 psi) laboratory test per

705 Application Review Fees-Special Municipal Account
705.1 When reviewing an application for permit approval, the Board may determine that the
assistance of outside consultants is warranted due to the size, scale or complexity of a
proposed project or because of a project's potential impacts. The Board may require that
applicants pay, at time required by the Board, a "review fee" consisting of the reasonable
costs to be incurred by the Board for the employment of outside consultants engaged by
the Board to assist in the review of an application. The review fee may be increased or
deceased by the Board from time to time depending on the needs of the project as
determined by the Board.
705.2 In hiring outside consultants, the Board may engage engineers, planners, lawyers, urban
designers or other appropriate professionals who can assist the Board in analyzing a project

proof of “no adverse impact” to the groundwater resources is provided by the
applicant. If any land designated as lying within the Groundwater Protection
District is proved not to possess the characteristics by which the district is
delineated and which this bylaw seeks to protect, the Planning Board may
permit uses of the land otherwise prohibited or requiring a special permit under
this section if it finds that such use will not be detrimental to the environment
or the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. The burden of
proof in such cases concerning the proposed designation of land at issue shall
be upon the owner(s) of the land in question. At the request of the owner, the
Planning Board may engage a professional geologist, hydrologist, soil scientist,
or licensed Massachusetts engineer experienced in groundwater evaluation or
hydrogeology for the purpose of determining whether the land in question
21
possesses the characteristics by which groundwater protection districts are
delineated. The Planning Board may charge the owner for the cost of making
such determination. The Planning Board shall provide the owner with a
statement of work performed and the cost thereof when charging an owner
hereunder.

80
(c) Variances
To authorize upon appeal, or upon petition with respect to a particular parcel of

Zoning Board of Appeals specifically finds that owing to circumstances relating
to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or the location of
structures especially affecting such land or structures but not generally the district

public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent and
purpose of this by-law. No variance may be authorized for a use or activity not
otherwise permitted in the district where the land is located. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may impose conditions, safeguards and limitations both of time and use,
but may not impose a condition based upon the continued ownership of land by
any owner. The rights authorized by such variance shall lapse if not exercised
within one year of the date of the grant.

PUBLIC FORUM
Regulation Adopted June 18, 2002
In order to ensure an opportunity for participation for all commissioners and landowners, all
decisions, agreements, and determinations requiring action by a majority of the Conservation
Commission shall be arrived at in a public forum.
ENFORCEMENT ACTION
Regulation Adopted April 2, 2019
Administrative Procedure for Enforcement
The following guidelines outline the response that the Commission and/or its agents will take to
violations or apparent violations of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, the Act:
1. Step 1: Informal Contact. Contact the violator or property owner to arrange a meeting (on site, in
office, or at a Commission meeting) or visit the property to speak informally with the violator or
property owner. Discuss with the contact the site activity, the legal requirements, and possible
remedial action. If full cooperation and agreement is achieved, Commission may issue a
Restoration Enforcement Order (see below). If cooperation is not achieved, then the Commission
will proceed to the next steps.
2. Step 2: Document Site Access, including a written notation to the file that identifies who visited
the site and when, and who authorized access. If consent has not been obtained, it is very
important to document attempts to gain access and the landowner's response.
3. Step 3: Violation Letter. If informal contact cannot be made, send a violation (form) letter,
informing violator and/or property owner of the wetlands protection laws and the apparent
violation. A cease and desist may be issued, a requirement to prevent further damage, and a
request for the owner to attend the Commission's next meeting. A violation letter, issued under
the Act, will constitute a warning that a public hearing will be held.
4. Step 4: Administrative Hearing. When the Commission determines that an activity could be in
violation of the Act, the Commission shall hold a public hearing to give the property owner, or
owner's representative, an opportunity to respond to the evidence and circumstances. The
Commission will then consider whether a violation actually occurred and, if so, whether the
landowner will be issued an Enforcement Order or Restoration Enforcement Order for the
violation. During public hearings, site observations should be reduced to a memorandum and
documents should be entered into the record in such a manner that the applicant and other
participants are aware of their contents and have an opportunity to respond to them. It should be
noted that since Commissioners frequently have specialized knowledge of the site of the violation
or the area from site visits, previous proceedings, other documentary materials, or merely general
experience, they can rely on those sources of knowledge to some extent.
5. Step 5: Enforcement Order. Failing an adequate response to Step 3: Violation Letter, or for
serious violations, the Commission may issue an Enforcement Order under the Act in lieu of or in
addition to an Enforcement Order under the Bylaw. If only one document is issued pursuant to
both the Act, each law should be cited on the document's face. All Enforcement Orders and
letters should be directed toward restoration rather than toward the filing of plans or a NOL If
further enforcement action is required, it should be because of failure to restore illegally altered
land to its original condition rather than for the responsible party's failure to submit plans or a
2
NOi. In a situation requiring immediate action, an Enforcement Order may be signed and issued
by a single member or agent of the Commission, as long as said Order is ratified by a majority of
the Commission at their next scheduled meeting. The Enforcement Order should be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery to each of the named parties. If it is
hand delivered, the individual who delivered the document should sign the Order and either
obtain a receipt or draft an affidavit documenting service for the files. Any time an Enforcement
Order is amended, the Amended Order should also be properly served on the violator.
6. Step 6: Restoration Order. If full cooperation and agreement is achieved, the Commission may
issue a Restoration Order, setting forth specific requirements for the restoration of the site to its
original condition within a specified time period. This Order would require a detailed Restoration
Plan, including specific dates for submissions, construction, and compliance milestones. If the
compliance milestones are not met, then a formal Enforcement Order may be issued, per Step 5,
above.
Regulation Adopted July 16, 2002, amended July 18, 2006
Any Commission correspondence associated with enforcement actions, either current or pending,
shall be forwarded to the Board of Selectmen and other relevant departments including but not
limited to the Zoning Enforcement Officer/Building Inspector, Board of Health and Planning
Board.
ENFORCEMENT ORDER ISSUANCE
Revised Adopted June 18, 2002, amended April 2, 2019
Pursuant to 310 CMR 10.08 (3), it is the policy of the Commission that a single member of the
Commission, or agent acting on the Commission's behalf, may issue an Enforcement Order only
if, in the opinion of the issuer, a resource area is being damaged or is in danger of being damaged
prior to the next scheduled meeting. The Commission shall endorse and/or revise said issuance at
their next scheduled meeting, or failing said endorsement the Order shall expire, and notice of
said expiration shall be sent via certified mail to the issuee.
ANRAD POLICY
Regulation adopted November 23, 2004
Any delineation greater than 600 aggregate linear feet will require the filing of an Abbreviated
Notice of Resource Area Delineation (ANRAD) application with the Commission.
3
HAY BALE POLICY
Regulation adopted July 18, 2006: amended December 4, 2018
Where siltation control is necessary to protect any of the eight interests of the Act, it shall be in
the form of staked hay bales and shall be duly noted on all site plans. Siltation control shall
encompass all wetland replication areas on both wetland and upland sides. The haybale line shall
be depicted on the plans as the Limit of Disturbance.
UTILITIES
Regulation adopted July 18, 2006
When applicable, site plans shall depict utilities to be installed either under or above ground.
P ARTICIP A TI ON
Regulation adopted July 18, 2006
A record of participation - made available to the Board of Selectmen and to the public upon
request - shall be maintained for Commissioners (regular and associate) and staff. The
participation record shall record attendance at all public meetings and inspections and education
efforts undertaken by the members during their appointment. Members are expected to attend a
minimum of 50% of all regularly scheduled public meetings and 50% of all regularly scheduled
site visits.
ASSOCIATE MEMBERS
Regulation adopted July 18, 2006
The Commission is always seeking new and talented individuals to contribute by serving as
Associate Members. Associates are appointed by the Commission to serve and contribute in the
same capacity as members with the exception of the ability to vote.
After a minimum term of three months as Associate member, the voting members of the
Commission may recommend to the Board of Selectmen he/she be appointed a permanent
member. Recommendation will be based on meeting and site walk participation and knowledge
or contribution which enriches the Commission to better serve the residents of the Town of
Rehoboth.

ABBREVIATED NOTICES OF RESOURCE AREA DELINEATION
Regulation adopted July 18, 2006
All ANRAD applications must include a complete and accurate description of the site including
but not limited to: structures, changes in topography, and resource areas not being reviewed. Pole
numbers for location in the field must be depicted on the plan.
The Commission shall make every effort to review an ANRAD filing associated with a singlefamily
house without hiring an outside consultant. The Commission shall make every effort to
make costs associated with the review of an ANRAD by a consultant reasonable and affordable.
ANRAD filings that meet any of the following criteria may be subject to a consultant review
payable by the applicant:
a) wetlands area is not dominated by wetland indicator vegetation with an indicator category
of FACW or wetter
b) Bordering Vegetated Wetlands is not abrupt or discrete
c) plant communities have been altered
d) soil has been disturbed
e) when determining a mean annual high-water line
f) when determining a flood zone boundary
The Commission may require additional supporting materials to be prepared by other
professionals including, but not limited to a registered landscape architect, registered land
surveyor, environmental scientist, geologist, botanist, or hydrologist as warranted by the
complexity of the project.
The Commission may require soil test results including but not limited to when:
a) wetlands area vegetation is transitional or not dominated by wetland indicator vegetation
with an indicator category of F ACW or wetter
b) Bordering Vegetated Wetlands boundary is discrete or not abrupt
c) plant community has been altered or site has been disturbed
The Commission encourages the submission of DEP Bordering Vegetated Wetlands Field Data
Forms when filing for an ANRAD or delineating a Bordering Vegetated Wetland. For
delineations of areas other than Bordering Vegetated Wetlands, the Commission encourages the
use of a narrative to explain the other methods of delineation and any appropriate data forms.

HIRING OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS
Regulation adopted July 18, 2006
As provided by MGL Ch. 40 §SC and Ch. 44 § 53G, the Rehoboth Conservation Commission
may impose reasonable fees for the employment of outside consultants, engaged by the
Conservation Commission, for specific expert services deemed necessary by the Commission to
come to a final decision on an application submitted to the Conservation Commission pursuant to
the requirements of the Wetlands Protection Act (GL Ch. 131 § 40), the Conservation
Commission Act (GL Ch. 40 § SC), or any other state or municipal statute, bylaw or regulation,
as they may be amended or enacted from time to time.
Funds received by the Conservation Commission pursuant to these rules shall be deposited with
the Rehoboth Treasurer who shall establish a special account for this purpose. Expenditures from
this special account may be made at the direction of the Conservation Commission without
further appropriation as provided in GL Ch. 44 §53G. Expenditures from this account shall be
made only in connection with the review of a specific project or projects for which a consultant
fee has been collected from the applicant.
Specific consultant services may include but are not limited to resource area survey and
delineation, analysis of resource area values, hydro geologic and drainage analysis, impacts on
municipal conservation lands, and environmental or land use law. The consultant shall be chosen
by, and report only to, the Commission and/or its Agent.
The Conservation Commission shall select consultants on a revolving basis from a list made
available to the public. The Commission shall make every effort to avoid selecting a consultant
that may have a conflict of interest, if so, advised by the applicant in a timely manner.
The Conservation Commission shall give written notice to the applicant of the selection of an
outside consultant, which notice shall state the identity of the consultant, the amount of the fee to
be charged to the applicant, and a request for payment of said fee in its entirety. Such notice shall
be deemed to have been given on the date it is mailed or delivered.
The fee must be received in its entirety prior to the initiation of consulting services. The
Commission may request additional consultant fees if necessary, review requires a larger
expenditure than originally anticipated or new information requires additional consultant
services. Failure by the applicant to pay the consultant fee specified by the Commission within
ten (10) business days of the request for payment shall be cause for the Commission to determine
that the application is administratively incomplete (except in the case of an appeal). The
Commission shall state such in a letter to the applicant, copied to the DEP. No additional review
or action shall be taken on the permit request until the applicant has paid the requested fee.
The applicant may appeal the selection of the outside consultant to the Rehoboth Board of
Selectmen pursuant to MGL Ch. Ch. 44 § 53G, who may disqualify the outside consultant
selected only on the grounds that the consultant has a conflict of interest or does not possess the
minimum required qualifications.
