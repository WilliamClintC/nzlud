paid. When not more than two (2) candidates for a City
Councilmember or Mayoral seat to be filled in the forthcoming
November municipal general election timely file an affidavit of
candidacy for the office and timely pay the proper filing fee,

City of Alexandria upon hook-up by any person, firm, or
corporation, to the Alexandria Sewer System consistent with the
formula set forth herein.
(2) The amount of the assessment shall be as
follows:
a. For new sanitary sewer
construction, based upon the exact cost of the project, which
costs shall include but not be limited to all amounts necessary
for preparation, construction, financing of the project (bonding
amortization payments), and the following formula:
1. Individual
Assessment - Capacity Value + Use Value.
2. For purposes of
determining the application of the above formula, the following
definitions shall apply:
a. For application
of the formulas explained herein and the factors used, reference
is made to Appendices I, II and III attached hereto.
b. Capacity Value
- Costs related to Major Life Station x Individual M Total "M"
Flow Value of the System M Unit Value.
c. Use Value -
Total Project Cost minus Major Lift Station Costs x Individual
Total "A Unit Value" of the System A Unit Value
d. "M" Value - A
value assigned to each parcel, structure, or complex achieving a
lateral sewer benefit which is based on capacity in the Sanitary
Sewer System (See Appendices I and II for computation of "M"
values, and standards for same.)
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-43
e. "A" Value - A value
assigned to each parcel, structure, or complex achieving a lateral
sewer benefit which is based on the use of the Sanitary Sewer
2-43
System (See Appendix III for computation of the "A" Value.)
f. Total "M" value of
the system - a summation of the individual "M" values assigned to
all property achieving a lateral sewer benefit.
g. Total "A" value of
the system - a summation of the individual "A" values assigned to
all property achieving lateral sewer benefit.
b. For past or future grant funded
sanitary sewer projects, the assessment to the individual property
owner shall be based upon those costs associated with the City's
share of the project cost (other than ALASD Lines).
Any grant funds received shall not be included in calculating the
said assessment.
c. For Sanitary Sewer Lines (other
than ALASD lines) existing at the time of the adoption of this
ordinance, the hook-up assessment shall be based upon the
assessment formula set forth in subparagraph a, above, however,
the formula shall be applied to the actual costs relating to the
value of the construction and maintenance of existing sanitary
sewer system.
d. For lines constructed by the
Alexandria Lakes Area Sanitary District, the connection charge
shall be the same as those charges assessed and established by the
Alexandria Lakes Area Sanitary District.
e. If the use to which a connection
shall be made is a use which creates sewage flow amounts greater
than that of which the connection system was designed (i.e., the
use requires trunk lines to be enlarged to provide the necessary
capacities) then there shall be an additional charge assessed
equal to part or all of the costs of increasing the trunk lines as
determined by the City of Alexandria.
f. If a property owner desiring to
hook-up to an existing line, which is located in an area where
there has been a special assessment made for sanitary sewer
facilities in the past, there shall be no connection charge as
herein provided, except in the following redeveloped
circumstances:
i. For non-residential
redevelopment, a connection charge is required if the
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-44
redevelopment site requires a larger pipe size than the existing
pipe size. In this case, the property owner will be charged the
difference in connection charges between the existing pipe size
2-44
and the proposed pipe size as set forth in subparagraph “a.”
above.
ii. For residential development, a
connection charge is required if the redeveloped site will result
in a net increase in density from the time the initial special
assessments were made. In this case, the property owner will be
assigned connection charges as set forth in subparagraph “a.”
above for the increased density.
Source: Ord. 647-2nd Series
Effective Date: 10/26/09
g. In the event that a property
located adjacent to sanitary sewer lines contains no structure
thereon to provide for sanitary sewer facilities, the assessment
as herein provided may be delayed until such hook-up is made,
however, interest shall be charged on the said connection
assessment at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum until the
same is paid.
(3) Where in the opinion of the engineers it
is necessary to install an individual grinder pump lifting device
for purposes of securing adequate flowage from a using unit, to
the adjacent public sewer system, a property owner may:
a. Provide the necessary grinder pump
and related lines to transmit sewage to the adjacent public sewer
system, which pump and lines must be approved by the Alexandria
Lakes Area Sanitary District, and which shall be done at the
property owner's expense, and which lifting device and discharge
line shall be owned, maintained and operated at the expense of the
property owner; or,
b. The owner may request that the
lifting device be installed by the City, or its agent, under the
following terms and conditions:
1. The City of Alexandria shall
install, own and maintain the grinder pump in the discharge line.
(The discharge line is a small diameter line connecting the
grinder pump with the main line sewer in the right-of-way.)
2. The property owner shall sign
an easement giving the City of Alexandria the right to constitute
and maintain the grinder pump and discharge line. The City of
Alexandria shall not pay any compensation for this easement.
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-45
3. The City of Alexandria may
levy a surcharge against the owners who are furnished with the
grinder pump installation. The surcharge will be based upon the
2-45
distance between the structure generating the wastewater (the home
or using unit) and the public right-of-way or the distance between
the grinder pump and the public right-of-way, whichever is the
lesser distance. The charge to a landowner for the installation
of the required grinder pump shall be based upon the contractor's
allocated cost for installation to that particular property.
4. The property owner must
provide and pay for the connection from the structure generating
the wastewater (home or using unit) to the grinder pump unit. This
work may be done by any licensed contractor and a permit for this
sewer connection must be applied for by the property owner and/or
the contractor at the duly designated office. There is no charge
for this sewer connection permit.
5. Inasmuch as the grinder pump
unit has electric motors and the grinder pump installation
providing service to the property owner will be energized by the
property owner's electrical service, the electricity used at the
grinder pump will run through the property owner's meter and
therefore the property owner will pay the cost. Where two or more
property owners are using one grinder pump installation, then the
electrical energy necessary will be run through a meter that will
be owned by the City of Alexandria and each property owner will
pay an amount for the electrical energy as part of the monthly
user charge.
D. Special Fund. Any sums thus received by the
City shall be deposited or paid into a special assessment fund or
account and may be accredited to the cost of sewer improvements.
E. Payment of Connection Charges and optional
provision for payment on an installment basis and interest imposed
thereon.
(1) Payment of the connection charges
provided for in this section shall be due immediately upon the
completion of the owner's connection to the sewer system; or
(2) Upon written request by the owner and
approval thereof by the City Council, the connection charge may be
paid in equal annual installments over a period of years in the
same manner provided for payment of special assessments by
Minnesota Statutes 429.061 (except that notice of hearing shall
not be required) together with interest on the unpaid balances as
of January 1 of each year of said charge at a rate to be fixed by
the City of Alexandria, said charge to be a lien upon the premises
connected. Such request shall be made upon forms furnished by the
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-46
City. After approval of such request by the Council, the City
Clerk shall prepare a roll showing the amount of the connection
charge extended over the equal annual installments including
2-46
interest: each installment including interest being set forth
separately. The payments thus provided for shall be made as all
other special assessments provided for pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 429.
F. Discontinuance of Service. Sewer service may
be shut off and discontinued when it is determined that a sum
equal to the portion of the cost of construction mains and
laterals attributable to the parcel or property as determined by
assessment proceedings or pursuant to the connection charges
established pursuant to this ordinance have not been paid or is
not in the process of being paid in regular installments.

Subd. 7. City Water Connection.
A. From and after the effective date of this
ordinance (November 12, 1991) no person, corporation, firm or
entity shall make or cause to be made any new or additional
connection with any water in the City of Alexandria for the
purpose of connecting to any municipal water system, without first
obtaining from the City of Alexandria a permit therefor as
hereinafter set forth. This section shall not apply to any parcel
of property located within the geographical area of any special
assessment district established prior to the date of this
ordinance.
B. Application for such permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the City Council and such application shall be
made at the office of the City's duly designated agent.
C. Water Assessment.
(1) A water assessment shall be made by the
City of Alexandria upon hook-up by any person, firm, or
corporation, to the Alexandria Water System consistent with the
formula set forth herein.
(2) The amount of the assessment shall be as
follows:
a. For new water construction, the
assessment shall be based upon actual costs including but not be
limited to all amounts necessary for preparation, construction and
financing of the project based upon the following formula:
Individual Assessment = Capacity Value + Use Value
For the purpose of determining the application of the above
formula, the following definitions shall apply:
Application
1. For application of the formulas explained
herein and the factors used, reference is made to Appendices I, II
and III attached hereto.
2. Capacity Value. Eighty percent (80%) of
the sanitary sewer capacity value as defined in Section 2.73,
Subd. 6C(2)a2b of the City Code.
3. Use Value. Eighty percent (80%) of the
sanitary sewer use value as defined in Section 2.73, Subd.
6C(2)a2c of the City Code.
2-54
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-54
4. "M" Value. A value assigned to each
parcel, structure, or complex achieving a water benefit which is
based on capacity in the Water System. (See Appendices I and II
for computation of the "M" values, and standards for same.)
5. "A" Value. A value assigned to each
parcel, structure, or complex achieving a water benefit which is
based on the use of the Water System. (See Appendix III for
computation of the "A" Values, and standards for same.)
6. Total "M" Value of the System. A
summation of the individual "M" values assigned to all property
achieving a water benefit.
7. Total "A" Value of the System. A
summation of the individual "A" values assigned to all property
achieving a water benefit.
b. For past or future grant funded water
projects, the assessment to the individual property owner shall be
based upon those costs associated with the City's share of the
project cost. Any grant funds received shall not be included in
calculating the said assessment.
c. For Water Lines existing at the time of the
adoption of this Ordinance, the hook-up assessment formula set
forth in subparagraph C(2)a1, above, however the formula shall be
applied to the actual costs relating to the value of the
construction and maintenance of the existing water system.
d. If the use to which a connection shall be made
is a use which creates water flow amounts greater than that for
which the connecting system was designed, (i.e. the use requires
trunk lines to be enlarged to provide the necessary capacities)
then there shall be an additional charge assessed equal to part or
all of the costs of increasing the trunk lines as determined by
the City of Alexandria.
e. If a property owner desiring to connect to an
existing line, which is located in an area where there has been a
special assessment made for water facilities in the past, there
shall be no connection charge as herein provided, except in the
following redevelopment circumstances:
i. For non-residential redevelopment,
a connection charge is required if the redevelopment site requires
a larger pipe size than existing. In this case, the property
owner will be charged the difference in connection charges between
the existing pipe size and the proposed pipe size as set forth in
subparagraph “C. (2) a. 1.” above.
2-55
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-55
ii. For residential development, a
connection charge is required if the redeveloped site will result
in a net increase in density from the time the initial special
assessments were made. In this case, the property owner will be
charged connection charges as set forth in subparagraph “C. (2) a.
1.” above for the increase density.
Source: Ord. 647-2nd Series
Effective Date: 10/26/09
f. In the event that a property located adjacent
to water lines contains no structure thereon to provide for water
facilities, the assessment as herein provided may be delayed until
such hook-up is made, however, interest shall be charged on the
said connection assessment at the rate of eight percent (8%) per
annum until the same is paid.
D. Special Fund. Any sums received by the City shall
be deposited or paid into a special assessment fund or account and
may be accredited to the cost of water improvements.
E. Payment of Connection Charges.
(1) Payment of the connection charges provided for
in this section shall be due immediately upon the completion of
the owner's connection to the water system; or
(2) Upon written request by the owner and approval
thereof by the City Council, the connection charge may be paid in
equal annual installments over a period of years in the same
manner provided for payment of special assessments by Minnesota
Statutes Section 429.061 (except that notice of hearing shall not
be required) together with interest on the unpaid balances as of
January 1 of each year of said charge at a rate to be fixed by the
City of Alexandria, said charge to be a lien upon the premises
connected. Such request shall be made upon forms furnished by the
City. After approval of such request by the Council, the City
Clerk shall prepare a roll showing the amount of the connection
charge extended over the equal annual installments including
interest: each installment including interest being set forth
separately. The payments thus provided for shall be made as all
other special assessments provide for pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 429.
F. Discontinuance of Service. Water service may be
shut off and discontinued when it is determined that a sum equal
to the portion of the cost of construction mains and laterals
attributable to the parcel or property as determined by assessment
proceedings or pursuant to the connection charges established
pursuant to this ordinance have not been paid or is not in the
2-56
9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-56
process of being paid in regular installments.
Subd. 8. Connection Charges For Redeveloped Parcels.
When parcels are redeveloped and connection is made to the
sanitary sewer or water line, the connection charge shall be
calculated as set forth under Section 2.73, Subd. 6 and Subd. 7,
and credit shall be given to the past development based upon
current values so the net connection charge shall be the
difference between the connection charge calculated for the
redeveloped property and the original property. (Also, see
Section 2.73 Subd. 6. C. (2) f. and Subd. 7. C. (2) e.).

Section 2.74. Storm Water Drainage Utility.
Subd. 1. Establishment. Pursuant to Minnesota Statues,
Section 444.075, the City establishes a Storm Water Drainage
Utility, and authorizes the imposition of just and reasonable
charges for the use and availability of storm drainage facilities.
The Storm Water Drainage Utility operations shall be a part of
the Public Works Department.
Subd. 2. Findings and Determination. In the exercise
of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public
health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the City has
constructed, operated and maintained a storm water drainage
system. This Ordinance is adopted in the further exercise of such
authority and for the same purposes. The system, as constructed
heretofore, has been financed and paid for through the imposition
of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is necessary and
desirable to provide an additional method of recovering some or
all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging,
replacing, repairing, maintaining and operating the system through
the imposition of charges as provided in this ordinance. In
imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that
undertakes to make charges just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the system, past methods of
recovering system costs, the topography of the City and other
relevant factors, it is determined to be just and equitable to
assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of
improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing, repairing,
maintaining and operating the system on the basis of the expected
storm water runoff from the various parcels of land within the
City during a standard rainfall event.
Subd. 3. Storm Drainage Utility Fund. There is hereby
created a Storm Water Drainage Utility Fund into which all
charges, when collected, and all monies received from the sale of
any related facilities or equipment or any byproducts shall be
placed. Such monies shall be used first to pay the normal,
reasonable and current costs of operating and maintaining the
facilities.
Subd. 4. Definitions.
A. Utility Factor. The utility factor is defined
as the ratio of runoff volume, in inches, for a particular land
use, to the runoff volume, in inches for an average single-family
residential property, assuming a 2-inch rainfall and Natural
Resources Conversation Services (NRCS) “Type B” soil conditions.

9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-64
B. Storm Water Utility Fee. The Storm Water
Utility Fee is defined as the annual charge developed for each
parcel of land. The Stormwater Management Committee will review
the fee every three years and make a recommendation to the City
Council regarding the adjustment of fees. Fee adjustment
recommendations shall be based on the projected revenue required
to fund the activities described in Subdivision 4.C. of this
section.
Source: Ord. 729-2nd Series
Effective Date: 07/27/15
C. Monthly Utility Revenue. The utility revenue
is the estimated monthly expenditures for planning and
inventories, capital expenditures, personnel and equipment and
operation of the Storm Water Utility, in accordance with
established City of Alexandria policy.
Subd. 5. Storm Water Utility Factors. The Storm Water
Utility fee shall be determined by first determining the
percentage of total runoff in Alexandria which is attributed to
single-family residential property. The fee per acre for singlefamily
residential is computed by computing the product for the
runoff percentage and the Storm Water Utility Revenue, divided by
the estimated total acres of single-family residential land use in
the City of Alexandria. The fee for residences zoned as ‘Multi-
Family Condominium’ shall be set at a flat rate to unify the
charge. The per acre fee for all other individual parcels shall
be defined as the product of the single-family residential peracre
fee, the appropriate utility factor and the total acreage of
the parcel. Single-family residential parcels shall be assessed
on a per household basis.
The utility factors for various land uses are shown in the
following table:
Classification Land Use
Utility
Factor
1 Residential 1.00
2 Multi-family 2.72
3 Apartments/Condos/Townhomes 2.72
4 Commercial 4.23
5 Industrial 3.30
6 Institutional 3.30
7 Public/Quasi Public 4.23
8 Airport/Fairground 3.30
9 Parks/Open Space/Cemeteries 0.25
10 Road Right-of-Way EXEMPT
11 Lakes/Streams/Wetlands EXEMPT
12 Agricultural/Vacant EXEMPT

Subd. 6. Other Land Uses. Other land uses not listed
in the foregoing table shall be classified by the City
Administrator by assigning them to classes most nearly like the
listed uses, from the standpoint of runoff volume for the standard
rainfall event. An appeal of such classifications from the
determination of the City Administrator may be made to the City
Council.
Source: Ord. 534-2nd Series
Effective Date: 4/12/04
Subd. 7. Adjustment of Charges.
A. The City Council authorizes the City
Administrator to adjust charges for parcels based upon land use
data supplied by staff or affected property owners which
demonstrates a runoff volume for a standard rainfall event or
other circumstances substantially different from factors being
used for such parcels. Such adjustments for storm water drainage
charges shall not be made retroactively. For those parcels one
acre or greater in size, the credit adjustment system is:
A. No retention 0% credit
B. 50% to 75% pervious surface 25% credit
C. 50% to 75% pervious surface and
pond/wetland areas
37.5% credit
D. 75% to 100% pervious surface 37.5% credit
E. Retention facility designed for
a 10-year storm event
37.5% credit
B. Adjustments to Previously Granted Credits.
Properties which received credits according to the credit schedule
as adopted in Ordinance No. 549, 2nd Series, and effective 2/14/05,
will have their credit reduced by 50% over a five-year period
beginning on January 1, 2016. The annual reductions will be
spread evenly over the five-year period.
Source: Ord. 729-2nd Series
Effective Date: 07/27/15
Subd. 8. Exemptions. The following land uses are
exempt from the storm water management fee:
A. Public Road Right-of-Way
B. Lakes
C. Wetlands
D. Agricultural
E. Vacant

9/25/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 2-66
Subd. 9. Payment of Fee. Storm Water Utility Fees
shall be billed every month with water and sanitary sewer bills.
The fee shall be due and payable on the same terms as water and
sanitary sewer utility bills. Any prepayment or overpayment of
charges shall be retained by the City of Alexandria and applied
against subsequent fees.
Subd. 10. Appeal. If a property owner or person
responsible for paying the Storm Water Utility fee believes that a
particular assigned fee is incorrect, such a person may request
that the fee be re-computed.
Subd. 11. Penalty for Late Payment. Each billing for
Storm Water Utility fees not paid when due shall incur a penalty
charge of ten percent (10 percent) of the amount past due.
Subd. 12. Establishment of Tax Lien. Any past due
storm water drainage charges will be certified to the County
Auditor for collection with real estate taxes against the property
served by the utility established in this ordinance for collection
as other taxes are collected in the following year pursuant to MS
Section 444.075, Subd. 3 and the Alexandria City Code. In
addition, the City may have the right to bring a civil action or
take other legal remedies to collect unpaid charges.

is the further intent of this ordinance to promote and encourage
the construction, development or improvement of restaurant or
hotel-motel facilities as defined hereunder, and to balance the

benefit to the community of Alexandria resulting from the
construction, development or improvement of restaurants and

thereof, shall be approved by the City Council before granting

in the taxicab in full view of passengers riding therein. A
taxicab licensee may petition the City Council for a review of
rates during the license period, and the City Council may
consider such petition and authorize new rates effective at any

of Alexandria on a semi-annual basis for all vehicles which
continue to be licensed during the licensing period.

or unsuitable, and the license shall remain suspended until such

malt liquor for the purpose of making delivery of
the intoxicating or non-intoxicating malt liquor to another. Each
violation of this ordinance shall be a misdemeanor.
Subd. 13. Upon any transfer of ownership of any taxicab,
the City may, where the transferor indicates that the vehicle is
no longer to be operated as a taxicab, validate by appropriate
endorsements thereon such license for use on another taxicab to
be designated by such transferor. The provision of the foregoing
sentence will also apply where the licensee will produce
satisfactory evidence that such taxicab has through destruction
or otherwise ceased to be used as a taxicab. Upon any transfer of
ownership of any taxicab where the transferor indicates that such
vehicle is to continue in use as a taxicab, the City may, by
appropriate endorsements thereon validate such license in the
hands of the transferee. Upon the death of any person owning a
vehicle licensed hereunder, the City may, upon receipt of

reinstatement of the Minnesota driver's license or issuance of a
limited license authorizing operation of a taxicab; provided,

Minnesota driver's license due to refusal to submit to a legally
08/17/18 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 4-33
required blood alcohol test under the state implied consent
statute will be grounds for the revocation, non-issuance or
nonrenewal of the taxicab driver's license.
C. Any licensed taxicab driver whose Minnesota
driver's license has been revoked and who has been issued a
limited license authorizing the operation of a taxicab will

manner as the tax.
3. Willful Failure to File a Return. If any
operator willfully fails to file any return or make any payment

defeat any such tax or payment thereof imposed by this Ordinance,
there shall be imposed as a penalty an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of any tax found due for the period to which such

paid, together with any penalty imposed by provisions of this
Ordinance, shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%)

tax and shall be collected as part thereof.
5. Application of Payment, Interest and Penalties.
All payments received pursuant to the provisions of this
Ordinance shall be credited first to penalties, next to interest,
and then to the tax due.

administer and enforce the assessment and collection of the taxes
imposed by this Ordinance. The City shall cause to be prepared
blank forms for the returns and other documents required by this

behalf of the City and authorized in writing by the City may
examine the books, papers and records of any operator in order to

operator is directed and required to give to the City, or its duly

opportunity for such examinations and investigations as are hereby

fail to remit the taxes collected or any penalty or interest
imposed by this Ordinance after written demand for such payment,
or who shall refuse to permit the City or its duly authorized
agent(s) to examine the books, records and papers under his or her

outside of areas designated as Shoreland areas, wellhead
protection areas, or SSTS providing sewage treatment for food,
beverage, or lodging establishments must have at least two (2)
feet of vertical separation between the bottom of the dispersal
system and seasonal saturation or bedrock.
b. SSTS built after March 31, 1996,
or SSTS located in a Shoreland area, wellhead Protection area,
or serving a food, beverage, or lodging establishment as defined
under Minn. R. Ch. 7080.1100, Subp. 84 shall have a three (3)-
foot vertical separation between the bottom soil infiltrative
surface and the periodically saturated soil and/or bedrock.
Existing systems that have no more than a fifteen percent (15%)
reduction in this separation distance (a separation distance no
less than thirty and six tenths (30.6) inches) to account for
settling of sand or soil, normal variation of separation
distance measurements and interpretation of limiting layer
characteristics may be considered compliant under this
Ordinance. The vertical separation measurement shall be made
outside the area of system influence but in an area of similar
soil. Minn. R. Ch. 7080.1500, Subp.4.
c. An existing SSTS System installed
prior to April 1, 1996, and located in a Shoreland Zoning
District shall be considered substandard if the tank capaCity
does not meet Minn. R. Ch. 7080.1930 and/or the soil dispersal
area of the SSTS does not meet the design flows of a
Classification I dwelling. Substandard SSTS systems shall be
upgraded and reclassified as a Type III system, which requires
an operating permit and annual reporting or repaired or replaced
in accordance with Minn. R. Ch. 7080.1500, Subp. 4(B). The
minimum estimated flow must be sized for a two (2) bedroom
dwelling as outlined in Minn. R. Ch. 7080.1860, Table IV; or
successor rules.
4. Local standards for holding tanks.
5-48
a. Undeveloped lots of record on
which a holding tank is the only practical means of sewage
treatment are unsuitable for residential use.
b. Holding tanks may be used as an
alternative for existing failing SSTS, or SSTS that pose an
imminent threat to public health or safety.
c. For vault toilets built in any
public facility.
d. For residential accessory
structures with lavatory facilities where it is not feasible to
connect to an existing SSTS on the property.
e. For replacement dwellings
constructed under Minnesota Statutes, Section 394.36; or
successor statutes with a previous existing, permitted holding
tank.
f. For recreational vehicle dump
stations located in a licensed recreational vehicle campground.
g. A holding tank designed to service
a recreational vehicle may be installed and used on an
undeveloped lot of record if:
1) A design, completed by a
licensed designer, is submitted that states the lot has an
acceptable area to accommodate a standard soil treatment system;
and
2) The designated future soil
treatment area is protected from compaction and/or development.
h. Note that to qualify as a holding
tank, tanks must comply with Minn. R. Ch. 7080.2290, items A
through F. Further, all owners of holding tanks shall be issued
an operating permit (Minn. R. Ch. 7082.0600, Subp.2A), which
must include the minimum provisions listed in Minn. R. Ch.
7082.0600, Subp.2B, (1) through (8).

and all construction therein shall be in accordance with such
established grades and lines.
Subd. 4. The Sub-Grade. Sub-grade for sidewalks and
curb and gutter shall be firm, compact and of uniform density.
All soft or spongy material and vegetable matter must be removed
and replaced with suitable material. The sub-grade shall be

established grade of the improvement and shall be approve by the
4/12/16 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 6-10
City before the improvement proceeds.
Subd. 5. Forms. All forms shall be made of rigid
material or straight and sound lumber not less than one and onehalf
inches in thickness. Forms must be free from warp and of
sufficient strength to resist springing out of shape. All forms
shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled before the concrete is
placed. The forms shall be securely staked to the established
6-10
line and grade. Forms shall be of such strength that when tested
as a single beam with a load equal to the weight of the finishing
machine to be used, the deflection shall not exceed one-quarter
inch in ten fee. The form shall be sufficiently rigid to resist
the impact and vibration of the finishing machine without
springing, weaving or settling. Forms shall be straight and free
from warp and shall not vary on the upper edge more than oneeighth

injurious amount of organic matter, lumps of clay or other
deleterious substances and shall make up from thirty percent to
fifty percent of the aggregate. The course aggregate shall be
screened gravel or crushed quarry rock of the proper size and
shall make up fifty percent of the aggregate.
C. Admixtures: Air-entraining admixtures shall
conform to American Society Testing Materials, Serial Designation
C-260. The total air content of air-entraining concrete shall be
within the limits of from three percent to eight percent by

alkali or vegetable matter. Not more that 5 1/2 gallons of water
per 94 pound bag of cement shall be used.
Subd. 7. Methods. The method of construction of
sidewalk and curb and gutter shall be as follows:
A. The Mixture: The materials used in each batch
shall be weighted or accurately measured so as to get an
4/12/16 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 6-11
uniform product. The materials shall be proportioned so as to
produce a uniform, dense, workable concrete which shall have a
compressive strength in 28 days of not less than 3,500 pounds per
square inch. In no case will a mixture be used which has less
than five 94 pound bags of cement for each cubic yard of concrete.
B. Mixing and Placing: The mixing shall be done
in an approved batch mixer until the cement is uniformly
distributed, and the mass is uniform in color and consistency.
6-11
The mixing period shall be not less than 90 seconds after all
ingredients are in the mixer. The concrete shall be placed in the
forms before it begins to set, tamped or vibrated and struck off
to the proper grade.
C. Curing: The concrete shall be cured by use of
membrane curing compounds which shall be of the surface membrane
type in conformance with A.A.S.H.O. Serial Designation M-148,
which compounds shall be non-toxic and shall contain a fugitive
dye which will not permanently alter the natural color of the
concrete, but which will impart sufficient color at the time of
application to indicate readily the areas covered. The work shall
not be placed during freezing weather or when freezing
temperatures may be expected without written permission from the
City. Under no circumstances shall salt, chemicals or other
foreign materials be mixed with the concrete to prevent freezing.
The sides of concrete slabs exposed by the removal of forms shall
be protected immediately to provide continuance of curing and
prevent injury of the curb and gutter edges and the underlying
sub-grade.

Public Way by Grantee, it shall, at its expense,
replace and restore such Public Way to the condition of

by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street
abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers,
drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of
structures or improvements by the City. If public funds

the cost of any of the foregoing, such funds shall also
be made available to the Grantee.
E. Relocation at Request of Third Party. The Grantee
shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or

of the Service Area so as to prevent branches from
coming in contact with the Grantee’s wires, cables, or
other equipment. The Grantee shall reasonably
compensate the City or property owner for any damages
caused by such trimming, or shall, in its sole
discretion and at its own cost and expense, reasonably
replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any
construction of the Cable System undertaken by Grantee.

be performed in substantial accordance with applicable
FCC or other federal, state, and local regulations. The
Cable System shall not unreasonably endanger or
interfere with the safety of persons or property in the
Service Area.
H. Aerial and Underground Construction. In those areas of
the Service Area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications and
electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise
shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground;
provided that such facilities are actually capable of
receiving Grantee’s cable and other equipment without
technical degradation of the Cable System’s signal
quality. In those areas of the Service Area where the
transmission or distribution facilities of the
respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are both aerial
and underground, Grantee shall have the sole discretion
to construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities, or any part
thereof, either aerial or underground. Nothing
contained in this section shall require Grantee to
construct, operate and maintain underground any groundmounted
appurtenances such as, but not limited to,
subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices
(splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power
supplies, pedestals, or other related equipment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this section, in the event that all of the transmission
or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications and
electric services are placed underground after the
effective date of this Ordinance, Grantee shall only be
required to construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground if
it is given reasonable notice and access to the public
utilities’ facilities at the time that such are placed
underground.
1. New Developments. The City shall use its best
efforts to provide the Grantee with written notice
of the issuance of building or development permits
for planned commercial/residential developments
within the Service Area requiring undergrounding
of cable facilities. The Grantee shall then be
responsible for coordinating such undergrounding
with the developers, at Grantee’s sole discretion
8-10
01/07/14 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 8-10
and in compliance with the line extension
requirements contained herein. Installation from
utility easements to individual homes or other
structures shall be at the cost of the
home/building owner or Developer unless otherwise
provided.
2. Local Improvement District. If an ordinance is
passed creating a local improvement district which
involves placing underground all utilities
including that of the Grantee which are then
located overhead, the Grantee shall participate in
such underground project and shall remove poles,
cables and wires from the surface of the
streets within such district and shall place them
underground in conformity with the requirements of
the City. The Grantee may include its costs of
relocating facilities associated with the
undergrounding project in said local improvement
district if allowed under applicable law.
I. Required Extensions of Service. The Cable System as
constructed as of the date of the passage and final
adoption of this Ordinance substantially complies with
the material provisions hereof. Grantee is hereby
authorized to extend the Cable System as necessary, as
desirable, or as required pursuant to the terms hereof
within the Service Area. Whenever Grantee shall receive
a request for service from at least fifteen (15)
Subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet
(one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution
cable, it shall extend its Cable System to such
Subscribers at no cost to said Subscribers for system
extension, other than the usual connection fees for all
Subscribers provided that such extension is technically
feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the
operation, financial condition, or market development
of the Cable System, or as provided under Section 3.13
of this Ordinance.
J. Subscriber Charges for Extensions of Service. No
Subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.
However, for unusual circumstances, such as a
Subscriber’s request to locate his cable drop
underground, existence of more than one hundred twentyfive
(125) feet of distance from distribution cable to
connection of service to Subscribers, or a density of
less than fifteen (15) Subscribers per 1,320 cablebearing
strand feet of trunk or distribution cable,
Cable Service or other service may be made available on
8-11
01/07/14 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 8-11
the basis of a capital contribution in aid of
construction, including cost of material, labor, and
easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of
capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne
by Grantee and Subscribers in the area in which Cable
Service may be expanded, Grantee will contribute an
amount equal to the construction and other costs per
mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals
the actual number of potential Subscribers per 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet of its trunk or distribution
cable, and whose denominator equals fifteen (15)
Subscribers. Potential Subscribers will bear the
remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro
rata basis. Grantee may require that the payment of the
capital contribution in aid of construction borne by
such potential Subscribers be paid in advance.
K. Service to Public Buildings.
Grantee shall provide Basic Cable Service and one free
outlet to each of the following public facilities:

as it is used as a high school by Alexandria School
District 206), the new high school being constructed by
Alexandria School District 206 during the term of this
Franchise, City Hall, Alexandria Police Department,
Alexandria Fire Department, Douglas County Public
Library and Douglas County Sheriff’s Office at their
current locations. Additional equipment services and
programming tiers will be billed according to Grantee’s
current pricing. No monthly service fee shall be
charged for such outlet. Grantee shall provide Basic
Cable Service to new construction hereafter for similar
public facilities, provided they are within one hundred
twenty-five (125) feet of the existing service lines of
Grantee. Provided, further, that tThe 125-foot
limitation shall not apply to the new high school being
constructed by Alexandria School District No. 206.

provisions of FCC Regulations Part I 1, subpart D,
Section 11.5 1, and as such provisions may from

Primary (SP) and/or the State Emergency Operations
Center (SEOC), as those authorities are
identified and defined within FCC Reg. Section
11.18.
2. The City shall permit only appropriately trained
and authorized Persons to operate the EAS

any manner that results in inappropriate use
thereof, or any loss or damage to the Cable
System. Except to the extent expressly prohibited
by law, the City shall hold the Grantee, its
employees, officers and assigns harmless from any
claims arising out of the emergency use of its
facilities by the City, including, but not limited
to, reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

Subd. 8. Franchise Fee.
A. Form. During the term of the franchise hereby granted,
the City may charge the Company a franchise fee. The
Company will administer the collection and payment of
franchise fees to City in lieu of permit fees, or other
fees that may otherwise be imposed on the Company in
relation to its operations as a public utility in the
City. The franchise fee will be collected on a flat
per meter basis, or by some other method that is
mutually acceptable to both City and Company for each
retail customer within the corporate limits of the
City. The amount of the fee collected may differ for
each customer class. The City will use a formula that
provides a stable and predictable amount of fees,
without placing the Company at a competitive
disadvantage. Such fee shall not exceed any amount
that the Company may legally charge to its customers
prior to payment to the City. If the Company claims
that the City required fee formula is discriminatory or
otherwise places the Company at a competitive
disadvantage, the Company will provide a formula that
will produce a substantially similar fee amount to the
City. If the City and Company are unable to agree, the
disagreement shall be subject to the Dispute Resolution
provisions of this Ordinance.
B. Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed
by separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council.
The effective date of the franchise fee ordinance
shall be no less than ninety (90) days after written
Notice enclosing a copy of the duly adopted and
approved ordinance has been served upon the Company by
Certified mail. The Company is not required to collect
a franchise fee if the terms of the fee agreement are
inconsistent with this franchise or state law, provided
the Company notifies the City Council of the same
within the ninety (90) day period.
C. Condition of Fee. The separate ordinance imposing the
fee shall not be effective against the Company unless
it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or substantially
similar amount on the sale of energy within the City by
any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such
supplier, the City has the authority or contractual
right to require a franchise fee or similar fee through
an agreed-upon franchise.
D. Collection of Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable
not less than quarterly during complete billing months
8-35
01/07/15 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 8-35
of the period for which payment is to be made. The
franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time,
however, the change shall meet the same Notice and
acceptance requirements and the fee may not be changed
more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed
any amount that the Company may legally charge to its
customers prior to payment to the City. Such fee is
subject to subsequent reductions to account for
uncollectibles and customer refunds incurred by the
Company. The Company shall not be responsible to pay
City fees that Company is unable to collect under
Commission rules or order. The Company agrees to make
available for inspection by the City at reasonable
times all records necessary to audit the Company’s
determination of the franchise fee payments.
E. Continuation of Franchise Fee. If this franchise
expires and the City and the Company are unable to
agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise fee,
if any being imposed by the City at the time this
franchise expires, will remain in effect until a new
franchise is agreed upon. However, the franchise fee
will not remain in effect for more than one year after
the franchise expires as stated in Section 2.6 of this
Franchise. If for any reason the franchise terminates,
the franchise fee will terminate at the same time.

Section 9.01. Toilet Installation Required. It is the duty
of every owner or occupant of any property within the City, having
a dwelling house or business building situated thereon, to install
a toilet in such dwelling or business building and make connection
thereof with such water and sewer mains if the same are abutting
on such property. Whenever the non-compliance of the owner or
occupant of such property is reported to the City, the Building
Official or their designee shall forthwith make such investigation
as he or she deems necessary or proper and report their findings
to the Council. If the Building Official or their designee finds
and reports that, in the Building Official or their designee

Section 9.03. Tobacco and Electronic Delivery Device Use in
Public Parks
Subd. 1. Purpose. The City of Alexandria is committed
to providing safe and healthy environments. Tobacco use is a
major cause of preventable disease and death. Electronic delivery
devices, more commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or ecigarettes,
closely resemble and mimic the act of smoking. Their
use in locations where smoking is prohibited creates concern and
confusion. The City of Alexandria believes the use of tobacco
products, including electronic delivery devices, in its parks is
detrimental to the health and safety of its community.
Subd. 2. Definitions.
A. All Times. “All times” means 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
B. Electronic Delivery Device. “Electronic delivery
device” means any product containing or delivering
nicotine, lobelia, or any other substance intended
for human consumption that can be used by a person
to stimulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine
or any other substance through inhalation of vapor
from the product. The term includes any such
devices, whether they are manufactured,
distributed, marketed or sold as e-cigarettes, ecigars,
e-pipes, or under any other product name
or descriptor.
C. Public Park. “Public Park” means all parks,
trails, and open space controlled by the City of
Alexandria.
D. Smoking. “Smoking” means inhaling or exhaling
from any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, pipe,
or any other tobacco or plant product, or inhaling
or exhaling aerosol or vapor from any electronic
delivery device. Smoking shall include being in
possession of a lighted or heated cigar,
cigarette, pipe, or any other lighted or heated
tobacco or plant product intended for inhalation,
or an electronic delivery device that is turned on
or is otherwise activated.
E. Tobacco Product. “Tobacco product” means any
product containing, made, or derived from tobacco
that is intended for human consumption, whether
chewed, smoked, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled,
snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means,
08/17/18 THIS PAGE REPLACES 9-3

or any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco
product, including but not limited to cigarettes,
cigars and other smoking tobacco; snuff and other
chewing tobaccos; and any other kinds and forms of
tobacco.
F. Tobacco Use. “Tobacco Use” means the act of
smoking or the use of any tobacco product in any
form or manner.
Subd 3. Tobacco Use and Electronic Delivery Device Use
Prohibited. The sale and use of tobacco products and electronic
delivery devices are prohibited at all times in or on all public
parks the City of Alexandria has the authority to control
regardless of location, unless authorized in specific areas by
the City Council.
Subd. 4. Enforcement. Any person found guilty of
violating this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Subd. 5. Severability and Savings Clause. If any
section or portion of this ordinance shall be found
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court
of competent jurisdiction, that finding shall not serve as
invalidation or affect the validity and enforceability of any
other section or provision of this ordinance.

Section 9.04. Use of Electronic Delivery Devices
Subd. 1. Purpose and Intent. Electronic delivery devices,
commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes,
closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by
having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or other substances
created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After
testing a number of e-cigarettes from two leading manufacturers,
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that various
samples tested contained not only nicotine but also
detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals,
including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a
toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA's testing also
suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture
these products are inconsistent or non-existent. ("Summary of
results: Laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted
by FDA.
"Food and Drug Administration(FDA),July 22, 2009;
http://www.fda.gov.NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm l73146.htm)
Electronic deli very devices produce a vapor of undetermined and
08/17/18 THIS PAGE REPLACES 9-4
potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to smoke
9-4
emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in work
places and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco
products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to
difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions.
Subd. 2. Definitions. Except as may otherwise be provided
or clearly implied by context, all terms shall be given their
commonly accepted definitions. For the purposes of this
Ordinance, the following definitions shall apply:
A. Electronic Delivery Device. Any product containing or
delivering nicotine, lobelia, or any other substance
intended for human consumption that can be used by a
person to simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine
or any other substance through inhalation of vapor from
the product. The term includes any such devices,
whether they are manufactured, distributed, marketed or
sold as e-cigarettes, e-cigars, e-pipes, or under any
other product name or descriptor.
B. Use. The inhaling or exhaling of aerosol or vapor from
any electronic delivery device. Use shall also mean
being in possession of an electronic delivery device
that is turned on or otherwise activated.
Subd. 3. Prohibition. The use of any electronic delivery
device is prohibited anywhere smoking is prohibited by the
Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act, as it may be amended from time to
time.
Subd. 4. Other Applicable Laws. This ordinance is
intended to complement the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act,
Minnesota Statutes, Sections 144.411 to 14.417 as it may be
amended from time to time. Nothing in this Ordinance authorizes
smoking or the use of an electronic delivery device in any
location that is regulated by other applicable laws or
regulations.
Subd. 5. Violation and Penalites.
A. Use where prohibited. It is a violation of this
Ordinance for any person to use an electronic delivery
device in an area where prohibited by this Ordinance,
or to use an electronic delivery device in an area
where prohibited by a private policy established by the
proprietor or other person in charge of the area.

CHAPTER 10
LAND USE REGULATION (ZONING)
The City Council of Alexandria does ordain that the Ordinance
commonly known as the "Zoning Ordinance of the City of Alexandria"
be enacted to read as follows:
Section 10.01 Title and Application
Subd. 1. Title. This Ordinance shall be known as the
"Alexandria Zoning Ordinance" except as referred to herein, where
it shall be known as "this Ordinance."
Subd. 2. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this
Ordinance is to protect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community and its people through the establishment
of minimum regulations governing development and use. This
Ordinance shall divide the City into use districts and establish
regulations in regard to location, erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration and use of structures and land. Such
regulations are established to protect such use areas; to promote
orderly development and redevelopment; to provide adequate light,
air and convenience of access to property; to prevent congestion in
the public right-of-way; to prevent overcrowding of land and undue
concentration of structures by regulating land, buildings, yards
and density of population; to provide for compatibility of different
land uses; to provide for administration of this Ordinance; to
provide for amendments; to prescribe penalties for violation of such
regulations; and to define powers and duties of the City staff, the
Board of Adjustment and Appeals, the Planning Commission, and the
City Council in relation to the Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 3. Relation to Comprehensive Municipal Plan. It
is the policy of the City of Alexandria that the enforcement,
amendment, and administration of this Ordinance be accomplished with
due consideration of the recommendations contained in the
Comprehensive Municipal Plan as developed and amended from time to
time by the Planning Commission and City Council of the City. The
Council recognizes the Comprehensive Municipal Plan as the Policy
for responsibility to regulate land use and development in
accordance with the policies and purpose as set forth.
Subd. 4. Standard, Requirement. Where the conditions
imposed by any provisions of this Ordinance are either more or less
restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by other ordinance,
rule or regulation of the City, the ordinance, rule or regulation
10.01-2
which imposes the more restrictive condition, standard, or
requirements shall prevail.
Subd. 5. Interpretation. In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety
and welfare.
Subd. 6. Scope. No structure shall be erected,
converted, enlarged, reconstructed or altered, and no structure or
land shall be used for any purpose nor in any manner which is not
in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Subd. 7. Occupancy, Building Permit. Except as herein
provided, no building, structure or premises shall hereafter be used
or occupied and no building permit shall be granted that does not
conform to the requirements of this Ordinance.
Subd. 8. Uses Not Provided For Within Zoning Districts.
Whenever in any zoning district a use is neither specifically
permitted nor denied, the use shall be considered prohibited. In
such case the City Council or the Planning Commission, on their own
initiative or upon request, may conduct a study to determine if the
use is acceptable and if so what zoning district would be most
appropriate and the determination as to conditions and standards
relating to development of the use. The City Council, Planning
Commission or property owner, upon receipt of the staff study shall,
if appropriate, initiate an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to
provide for the particular use under consideration or shall find
that the use is not compatible for development within the City.
Subd. 9. Authority. This Ordinance is enacted pursuant
to the authority granted by the Municipal Planning Act, Minnesota
Statutes, Sections 462.351 to 462.363.
Subd. 10. Separability. It is hereby declared to be the
intention of the City that the several provisions of this Ordinance
are separable in accordance with the following:
A. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall
adjudge any provision of this Ordinance to be invalid, such judgment
shall not affect any other provisions of this Ordinance not
specifically included in said judgment.
B. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall
adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this Ordinance
to a particular property, building, or other structure, such
10.01-3
judgment shall not affect the application of said provision to any
other property, building, or structure not specifically included in

Subd. 1. Non-Conforming Buildings, Structures and Uses.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to
provide for the regulation of non-conforming buildings, structures
and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and
conditions under which non-conforming buildings, structures and uses
will be operated and maintained. The zoning Ordinance establishes
separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the
location of uses which are permitted in that district. It is
necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts
that non-conforming buildings, structures and uses not be permitted
to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the intent of
this Section that
all non-conforming uses shall be eventually brought into conformity.

the City Assessor.
D. No non-conforming building, structure or use
shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of
land upon which the same was constructed or was conducted at the
time of this Ordinance adoption unless such movement shall bring
the non-conformance into compliance with the requirements of this
Ordinance.
E. When any lawful non-conforming use of any
structure or land in any district has been changed to a conforming
use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any non-conforming use.
10.03-2
F. A lawful non-conforming use of a structure or
parcel of land may be changed to lessen the non-conformity of use.

it shall not thereafter be so altered to increase the nonconformity.
Source: Ord. 338-2nd Series
Effective Date: 2/08/93
G. If at any time a non-conforming building,
structure or use shall be destroyed to the extent of more than fifty
(50) percent of its fair market value, said value to be determined
by the City Assessor, and no building permit has been applied for
within 180 days of when the property is destroyed, then without
further action by the Council, the building and the land on which
such building was located or maintained shall, from and after the
date of said destruction, be subject to all the regulations
specified by these zoning regulations for the district in which such
land and buildings are located. Any building, which is damaged to
an extent of less than fifty (50) percent of its value, may be
restored to its former extent. Estimate of the extent of damage or
destruction shall be made by the Building Inspector.

percent of the requirements of this Ordinance. If in a group of
two (2) or more contiguous lots of record under a single ownership,
any individual lot does not meet the minimum lot area or width
requirements of this Ordinance, such individual lot cannot be
considered as a separate parcel of land for purposes of sale or
development, but must be combined with adjacent lots under the same
ownership so that the combinations of lots will equal one or more
10.03-4
parcels of land each meeting the lot width or area requirements of
this Ordinance.

c. Mitigation. In any development that
the tree/woodland allowable removal limits are exceeded, the
applicant shall mitigate the tree loss by either reforestation of
(tree replacement) appropriate areas within the development area,
in accordance with the tree replacement schedule, or payment to
the city of the sum per diameter inch calculated from the total
amount of diameter inches of the required replacement trees in
accordance with the tree replacement schedule. The fee per diameter
inch shall be set forth in the city fee schedule and the payment
thereon shall be deposited into an account designated specifically
for tree mitigation.
The form of mitigation to be provided by the applicant shall
be determined by the city.
The planting of trees for mitigation shall be in addition to
any other landscape requirements of the city.
10.03-17
Significant tree replacement will be calculated by replacing
the largest diameter tree first, proceeding down to the smallest
diameter significant tree.
d. Required protective measures. The
tree preservation plan shall identify and require the following
measures to be utilized to protect significant trees, specimen
trees and significant woodlands:
1. Installation of snow fencing
or polyethylene laminate safety netting or silt fencing placed at
the drip line or at the perimeter of the critical root zone (CRZ),
whichever is greater, of significant trees, specimen trees and
significant woodlands to be preserved. No grade change,
construction activity or storage of materials shall occur within
this fenced area.
2. Identification of any oak
trees requiring pruning between April 15 and July 1. Any oak trees
so pruned shall be required to have any cut areas sealed with an
appropriate non-toxic tree wound sealant.
3. Prevention of change in soil
chemistry due to concrete washout and leakage or spillage of toxic
materials, such as fuels or paints.
e. Additional protective measures.
The following tree protection measures are suggested to protect
significant trees, specimen trees and significant woodlands that
are intended to be preserved according to the submitted tree
preservation plan and may be required by the city:
1. Installation of retaining
walls or tree wells to preserve trees.
2. Placement of utilities in
common trenches outside of the drip line of significant trees or
use of tunneled installation.
3. Use of tree root aeration,
fertilization and/or irrigation systems.
4. Transplanting of significant
trees into a protected area for later moving into permanent sites
within the construction area.
5. Therapeutic pruning.
f. Review process. The tree
preservation plan shall be reviewed by the city to assess the best
10.03-18
possible layout to preserve significant trees, specimen trees and
significant woodlands and to enhance the efforts to minimize damage
to specimen trees, significant trees and significant woodlands.
The applicant shall meet with city staff prior to submission of
the development application or prior to application for the grading
permit, whichever is sooner, to determine the most feasible and
practical placement of buildings, parking, driveways, streets,
storage and other physical features, in order that the fewest
significant trees, specimen trees and significant woodlands are
destroyed or damaged.
g. Performance guarantee. Any
applicant of a new development shall provide the required
performance guarantee following preliminary approval of the tree
preservation plan and prior to any construction and/or grading.
The amount of the performance guarantee to be submitted, specific
to the tree preservation fulfillments, shall be calculated as
follows:
1. Unless the applicant provides
tree mitigation in the form of cash dedication, 100% of the cost
of completing tree replacement mitigation as determined by the
city.
2. An amount to guarantee
preservation of all trees identified by the approved tree
preservation plan to be preserved. Within 15 feet of the
construction zone (measured from the construction limit to the
nearest side of the tree): The amount shall be calculated by
multiplying the total diameter inches of significant trees and
specimen trees to be preserved within this 15 feet zone by the
rate of payment of $25 per diameter inch and the total square feet
of significant woodlands to be preserved within the 15-foot zone
by the rate of $1.20 per square foot.
No performance guarantee shall be required for applicants of
building permits of single-family residential units.
Following written request by the applicant for acceptance,
the performance guarantee will be released upon verification by
the city that the tree preservation plan was followed and that the
tree replacement schedule was complied with, where necessary, but
in no event shall the performance guarantee be released earlier
than one year after the date of the project closure.
h. Removal of diseased trees required.
Prior to any grading, all diseased, hazard and nuisance trees on
10.03-19
the subject property shall be identified by the Park Department in
accordance with the tree disease control and prevention
regulations of the City Code. Any and all diseased and nuisance
trees so identified shall be removed from the property, at the
time of grading, if so directed.
i. Compliance with plan. The applicant
shall implement the tree preservation plan prior to and during any
construction. The tree protection measures shall remain in place
until all grading and construction activity is terminated or until
a request is made to and approved by the city.
No significant trees, specimen trees or significant woodlands
shall be removed until a tree preservation plan is approved and
except in accordance with the approve tree preservation plan as
approved by the city. If a significant tree(s), specimen tree(s)
or any significant woodlands that were intended to be preserved is
removed without permission of the City Park Department or damaged
so that it is in a state of decline within one year from date of
project closure, a cash mitigation, calculated per diameter inch
of the removed/destroyed tree or per total square foot of
significant woodlands, in the amount set forth in the city fee
schedule, shall be remitted to the city.
The City shall have the right to inspect the development
and/or building site in order to determine compliance with the
approved tree preservation plan. The city shall determine whether
compliance with the tree preservation plan has been met.
4. Allowable tree removal.

Section 10.18. "FP" Flood Plain Management District.
Subd. 1 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and
Purpose.
A. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of
the State of Minnesota has, in Minn. Stat. Chapter 104 and Chapter
462, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore,
the City Council of the City of Alexandria, Minnesota ordains as
follows:
B. Findings of Fact.
1. The flood hazard areas of the City of
Alexandria, Minnesota, are subject to period of inundation which
results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards.
This Ordinance is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
C. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of
this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize those losses described in Subd. 1,B,1 by
provisions contained herein.
Subd. 2. General Provisions.
A. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This
Ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Alexandria shown on the Official Zoning Map and the
Official Flood Plain District Map as being located within the
boundaries of the General Flood Plain District.
B. Establishment of Official Zoning Map. The
Official Zoning Map together with all materials attached thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
Ordinance. The Official Flood Plain District Map dated the 17th
day of January, 1983, and the Alexandria Watershed District--
Stormwater Management Study dated the 17th day of January, 1983,
are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the
10.18-2
Official Zoning Map and this Ordinance. The Official Zoning Map
and all materials attached thereto shall be on file in the office
of the City Zoning Administrator.
C. Interpretation.
1. In their interpretation and application,
the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the
governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by State Statutes.
2. The boundaries of the zoning district
shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map
and the Official Flood Plain District Map. Where interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district
as shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the Official Flood Plain
District Map as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the City
Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation based
on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile and other
available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the
district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present their case to the Board of Adjustment and Appeals and to
submit technical evidence.
D. Compliance. No structure or land shall
hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered without fully compliance with
the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations which
apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance.
E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not
intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where
this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
Ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinance inconsistent with this
Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This
Ordinance does not imply that the areas outside the flood plain
district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create
liability on the part of the City of Alexandria or any officer or
10.18-3
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this Ordinance or any administrative decisions lawfully made
thereunder.
G. Severability. If any section, clause,
provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional
or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
H. Definitions. Unless specifically defined
below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall be interpreted
so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage
and so as to give this Ordinance its most reasonable application.

10.18-4
flood plain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of
the flow of water, or reduce the amount of flood water storage
either in itself or by catching or collection debris carried by such
water.
Reach. A hydraulic engineering term to
describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by
a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment
of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would
most typically constitute a reach.

3. Variances. The Board may authorize in
accordance with Alexandria City Code Section 10.25 upon appeal in
specific cases such variance from the terms of this Ordinance as
will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special
conditions, literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance
will result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of the
Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. No
variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses
prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood
protection than required by this Ordinance for the particular area,
or permit standards lower than those required by State Law.

determination appealed from. It shall make its decision in writing
setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions.
In granting a Variance the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards such as are in conformity with the
purposes of this Ordinance. Violations of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the Variance
is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance punishable
10.18-12
under Subdivision 9. A copy of all decisions granting Variances
shall be forwarded by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources
within ten (10) days of such action.

required volume of compensating flood water storage and
determining the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation for the site.
(1) A typical cross-section showing
the channel of the stream, or bed of the lake, wetland or depression,
elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, or bed
of the lake, wetland or depression, cross-sectional areas to be
occupied by the proposed development, and high water information.
(2) Plan (surface view) showing
elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill, or
storage elevations; size, location, and spatial arrangement of all
proposed and existing structures on the site; location and
elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land uses and
vegetation upstream and downstream; and soil type.

drainage.
B. Restrict and control land development so it
will not impede the flow of water or cause danger to life or
property.
C. Designate suitable land uses that are
compatible with the preservation of the natural vegetation and
marshes which are a principal factor in the maintenance of constant
rates of water flow through the year and which sustain many species
of wildlife and plant growth.
D. Regulate runoff of surface waters from
developed areas to prevent pollutants such as motor oils, sand, salt
and other foreign materials from being carried directly into the
nearest natural stream, lake or other public or private waters.

in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to
provide for the wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands
of public waters. The Legislature of Minnesota has delegated
responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate the
subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters
and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters,
conserve the economic and environmental values of shorelands, and
provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This
responsibility is hereby recognized by the City of Alexandria.

shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private user
where there was no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the
governing body, be exempt from this ordinance.
B. Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public
waters; the size and shape of lots; the use, size, type and location

activity pursuant to Subd. 3A of this section.
D. Interpretation. In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be
minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of
the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal
of any other powers granted by State Statutes.

1. A permit is required for the construction
of buildings or building additions (and including such related
activities as construction of decks and signs), the installation
and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading
and filling activities not exempted by Subd. 5C of this section.
Application for a permit shall be made to the Building Inspector on
the forms provided. The application shall include the necessary
information so that the Building Inspector can determine the site's
suitability for the intended use and that a compliant sewage
treatment system will be provided.
10.20-10
2. A permit authorizing an addition to an
existing structure shall stipulate that an identified non-conforming
sewage treatment system, as defined by Subd. 5H, shall be
reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
3. A shoreland alteration permit is required
for all work which may include, but is not limited to: filling,
grading, digging, cutting of trees, brushing, changing of natural
surface, building or installing terraces, retaining walls or sand
blankets, ice ridge alteration or constructing whatsoever in the
building setback area of shoreland areas of riparian lots.
Application for a permit shall be made to the Planning Department
on the forms provided. The application shall include the necessary
information so that the Planning Department can determine the site’s
suitability for the intended activity and that it will comply with
all criteria and standards.

Effective Date: 2/09/09
B. Certificate of Zoning Compliance. The Zoning
Administrator shall issue a certificate of zoning compliance for
each activity requiring a permit as specified in Subd. 3A of this
section. This certificate will specify that the use of land conforms
to the requirements of this section. Any use, arrangement, or
construction at a variance with that authorized by
permit shall be deemed a violation of this section and shall be
punishable as provided in Subd. 2C of this section.
C. Variances.
1. Variances may only be granted in
accordance with Minn. Stat., Chapter 462 as applicable. A variance
may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of the section.
No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is
prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is
located. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance
to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the
public interest. In considering a variance request, the Board of
Adjustment and Appeals must also consider whether the property owner
has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the
property is used seasonally or year-round, whether the variance is
being requested solely on the basis of economic considerations, and
the characteristics of development on adjacent properties.
10.20-11
2. The Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall
hear and decide the requests for variances in accordance with the
rules that it has adopted for the conduct of business. When a
variance is approved after the Department of Natural Resources has
formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification
of the approved variance required in Subd. 3D 2 below shall also
include the Board of Adjustments and Appeals summary of the public
record/testimony and the findings of facts
and conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance.
3. For existing developments, the
application for variance must clearly demonstrate whether a
conforming sewage treatment system is present for the intended use
of the property. The variance, if issued, must require
reconstruction of a non-conforming sewage treatment system.
D. Notifications to the Department of Natural
Resources.
1. Copies of all notices of any public
hearings to consider variances, amendments, or conditional uses
under local shoreland management controls must be sent to the
Commissioner or the Commissioner's designated representative and
postmarked at least ten (10) days before the hearings. Notices of
hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies
of the subdivisions/plat.
2. A copy of approved amendments and
subdivision/plats, and final decisions granting variances or
conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be
sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designated
representative and postmarked within ten (10) days of final
action.
Subd. 4. Shoreland Classification System and Land Use
Districts.
A. Shoreland Classification System. The public
waters of the City of Alexandria have been classified below
consistent with the criteria found in Minnesota Regulations, Part
6120.3300, and the Protected Waters Inventory Map for Douglas

4. Additional Special Provisions.
a. Residential subdivisions with
dwelling unit densities exceeding those in the tables in Subd. 5A 2
and Subd. 5A 3 can only be allowed if designed and approved as
residential planned unit developments under Subd. 8 of this section.
Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can
be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width standards must be
met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building line.
The sewer lot area dimensions in Subd. 5A 2 can only be used if
publicly owned sewer system service is
available to the property.
b. Subdivision of duplexes, triplexes,
and quads on Natural Environment Lakes must also meet the following
standards:
(1) each building must be set back
at least 200 feet from the ordinary high water level;
10.20-16
(2) each building must have common
sewage treatment and water systems in one location and serve all
dwelling units in the building;
(3) watercraft docking facilities
for each lot must be centralized in one location and serve all
dwelling units in the building;
(4) no more than 25 percent of a
lake's shoreline can be in duplex, triplex, or quad developments.
c. Lots intended as controlled accesses
to public waters or as recreation areas for use by owners
of nonriparian lots within subdivisions are permissible and must
meet or exceed the following standards:
(1) they must meet the width and
size requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the
intended uses of controlled access lots.
(2) if docking, mooring, or overwater
storage of more than six (6) watercraft is to be allowed at a
controlled access lot, then the width of the lot (keeping the same
lot depth) must be increased by the percent of the requirements for
riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six (6),
consistent with the following table:
Controlled Access Lot Frontage Requirements
Ratio of lake size Required increase
to shore length in frontage
(acres/mile) (percent)
Less than 100 25
100-200 20
201-300 15
301-400 10
Greater than 400 5
(3) they must be jointly owned by
all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of
nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access
rights on the access lot; and
10.20-17
(4) covenants or other equally
effective legal instruments must be developed that specify which
lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities
are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching,
loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must also
include other outdoor recreational activities that do not
significantly conflict with general public use of the public water
or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property
owners. Examples of the non-significant conflict activities include
swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants must limit the
total number of vehicles allowed to be
parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously
moored, docked, or stored over water, and must require
centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most
suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation
alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage
buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or
topography as much as practical from view from the public water,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
B. Placement, Design, and Height of Structures.
1. Placement of Structures on Lots. When
more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities
must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures existing on
the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site,
structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform to
the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided
the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or
in a bluff impact zone. Structures shall be located as follows:
a. Structure and On-site Sewage System
Setbacks (in feet) from Ordinary High Water Level*.
Setbacks*
Classes of Structures Sewage Treatment
Public Waters Unsewered Sewered System
Lakes
Natural Environment 150 150 150
Recreational Development 100 75 75
General Development 75 50 50

*One water-oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with
Subd. 5B 2(b) of this section may be set back a minimum distance of
ten (10) feet from the ordinary high water level.
b. Additional Structure Setbacks. The
following additional structure setbacks apply, regardless of the
classification of the waterbody:
Setback From: Setback (in feet)
(1) top of bluff; 30
(2) unplatted cemetery; 50
(3) right-of-way line of federal,
state, or county highway; and 50
(4) right of way line of town road,
public street, or other roads
or streets not classified. 20
c. Bluff Impact Zones. Structures and
accessory facilities, except stairways and landings, must not be
placed within bluff impact zones.
d. Uses Without Water-Oriented Needs.
Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels
with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the
normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially
screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
2. Design Criteria For Structures.
a. High Water Elevations. Structures
must be placed in accordance with any floodplain regulations
applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the
elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed
or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
(1) for lakes, by placing the
lowest floor at least three (3) feet above the highest known water
level, or three (3) feet above the ordinary high water level,
whichever is higher;
10.20-19
(2) for rivers and streams, by
placing the lowest floor at least three (3) feet above the flood
of record, if data are available. If data are not available, by
placing the lowest floor at least three (3) feet above the ordinary
high water level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to
determine effects of proposed construction upon flood stages and
flood flows and to establish a flood protection elevation. Under
all three (3) approaches, technical evaluations must be done by a
qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with parts 6120.5000
to 6120.6200 governing the management of flood plain areas. If more
than one approach is used, the highest flood protection elevation
determined must be used for placing structures and other facilities;
and
(3) water-oriented accessory
structures may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation
determined in this item if the structure is constructed of floodresistant
materials to the elevation, electrical and mechanical
equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration
flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice
action and wind-driven waves and debris.
b. Water-Oriented Accessory Structures.
Each lot may have one water-oriented accessory structure not meeting
the normal structure setback in Subd. 5B 1 of this ordinance if this
water-oriented accessory structure complies with the following
provisions and is approved as a conditional use permit as set forth
in Section 10.23 of the City Code:
(1) the structure or facility must
not exceed ten (10) feet in height, exclusive of safety rails, and
cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square feet. Detached decks
must not exceed eight (8) feet above grade at any point;
(2) the setback of the structure or
facility from the ordinary high water level must be at least ten
(10) feet;
(3) the structure or facility must
be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and
adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks
or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;
10.20-20
(4) the roof may be used as a deck
with safety rails, but must not be enclosed or used as a storage
area;
(5) the structure or facility must
not be designed or used for human habitation and must not contain
water supply or sewage treatment facilities; and
(6) as an alternative for general
development and recreational development waterbodies, wateroriented
accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage,
and including storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting
equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet provided the
maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to
the configuration of the shoreline.
c. Stairways, Lifts and Landings.
Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major
topographic alterations for achieving access up and down bluffs and
steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet the
following design requirements:
(1) stairways and lifts must not
exceed four (4) feet in width on residential lots. Wider stairways
may be used for commercial properties, public open-space
recreational properties, and planned unit developments;
(2) landings for stairways and
lifts on residential lots must not exceed 32 square feet in area.
Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for commercial
properties, public open-space recreational properties, and planned
unit developments;
(3) canopies or roofs are not
allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings;
(4) stairways, lifts, and landings
may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or
placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a
manner that ensures control or soil erosion;
(5) stairways, lifts, and landings
must be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots,
as viewed from the surface of the public water assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
10.20-21
(6) facilities such as ramps,
lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also
allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the
dimensional and performance standards of sub-items (1) to (5) are
complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota
Regulations, Chapter 1340.
d. Significant Historic Sites. No
structure may be placed on a significant historic site in a manner
that affects the values of the site unless adequate information
about the site has been removed and documented in a public
repository.
e. Steep Slopes. The Building
Inspector must evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and
development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit
for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways,
structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined
necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent
erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures,
vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public
waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation.
3. Height of Structures. All structures in
residential districts, except churches and nonresidential
agricultural structures, must not exceed 25 feet in height.
C. Shoreland Alterations. Alterations of
vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent erosion into
public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics,
preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish
and wildlife habitat.
1. Vegetation Alterations.
a. Vegetation alteration necessary for
the construction of structures and sewage treatment systems and the
construction of roads and parking areas regulated by Subd. 5D of
this section are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards
that follow:
b. Removal or alteration of vegetation,
except for agricultural and forest management uses as regulated in
Subd. 5F2 and Subd. 5F3 respectively, is allowed subject to the
following standards:
10.20-22
(1) Intensive vegetation clearing
within the shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is not
allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest land conversion
to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a condition
use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and
approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the
property is located.
(2) In shore and bluff impact zones
and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and
cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view
to the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate
the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths,
livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas, and
permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities,
provided that:
(a) the screening of
structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced;
(b) along rivers, existing
shading of water surface is preserved; and
(c) the above provisions are
not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are
dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards.
(3) The use of fertilizer and
pesticides in the "S" Shoreland District must be done in such a way
as to minimize runoff into the shore impact zone or public water by
the use of earth, vegetation or both.
2. Topographic Alterations/Grading and
Filling.
a. Grading and filling and excavations
necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment
systems, and driveways under validly issued construction permits
for these facilities do not require the issuance of a separate
grading and filling permit. However, the grading and filling
standards in this subsection must be incorporated into the issuance
of permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems,
and driveways.
b. Public roads and parking areas are
regulated by Subd. 5D of this ordinance.
10.20-23
c. Notwithstanding items (a) and (b)
above, a grading and filling permit will be required for:
(1) the movement of more than ten
(10) cubic yards of material on steep slopes or within shore or
bluff impact zones; and
(2) the movement of more than 50
cubic yards of material outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff
impact zones.
d. The following considerations and
conditions must be adhered to during the issuance of construction
permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use permits,
variances and subdivision approvals:
Source: Ord 338-2nd Series
Effective Date: 2/8/93
(1) No grading is allowed in bluff
impact zones. Grading is allowed on steep slopes provided such
grading meets the standards set forth in Section 10.20, Subdivision
5C2d.
(2) Grading or filling in any type
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland must be evaluated to determine how
extensively the proposed activity would affect the following
functional qualities of the wetland*:
(a) sediment and
pollutant trapping and retention;
(b) storage of surface
runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
(c) fish and wildlife
habitat;
(d) recreational use;
(e) shoreline or bank
stabilization; and
10.20-24
(f) noteworthiness,
including special qualities such as historic significance, critical
habitat for endangered plants and animals, or others.
*This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the
wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or
approvals by other local, state or federal agencies such as
watershed district, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,
the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the City of
Alexandria.
(3) Alterations must be designed
and conducted in a manner that ensures only the smallest amount of
bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible;
(4) Mulches or similar materials
must be used, where necessary, for temporary bare soil coverage,
and a permanent vegetation cover must be established as soon as
possible;
(5) Methods to minimize soil
erosion and to trap sediments before they reach any surface water
feature must be used;
(6) Altered areas must be
stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards consistent with
the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation
Service;
(7) Fill or excavated material must
not be placed in a manner that creates an unstable slope;
(8) Plans to place fill or
excavated material on steep slopes must be reviewed by qualified
professionals for continued slope stability and must not create
finished slopes of 30 percent or greater;
(9) Fill or excavated material must
not be placed in bluff impact zones;
(10) Any alterations below the
ordinary high water level of public water must first be authorized
by the Commissioner under Minn. Stat. §103G.245;
10.20-25
(11) Alterations of topography must
only be allowed if they are accessory to permitted or conditional
uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties; and
(12) Placement of natural rock
riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement
of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not
exceed three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot
vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten (10) feet
of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above
the ordinary high water level does not exceed three (3) feet.

Effective Date: 2/08/93
(13) Application of fertilizer,
herbicides, pesticides or other chemicals within shorelands must be
done in such a manner as to eliminate impact on the shore impact
zone or public water by the use of earth or vegetation. Use of
fertilizer containing phosphorus is prohibited within 50 feet of
the ordinary high water level of a public water.
(14) Burning is prohibited within
100 feet of the ordinary high water level of a public water and/or
a storm sewer or other drainage conveyance which discharges into
waters of the state. (A wood-burning campfire less than three feet
in diameter, designed to enclose ash for removal is exempt.)

Effective Date: June 12, 2000
e. Connections to Public Waters.
Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a public
water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be
controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations
may be given only after the commissioner has approved the proposed
connection to public waters.
D. Placement and Design of Roads, Driveways, and
Parking Areas.
1. Public and private roads and parking areas
must be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and
topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public
waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual
that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the
10.20-26
field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation district, or other applicable technical materials.
2. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must
meet structure setbacks and must not be placed within bluff and
shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible placement
alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed
within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse
impacts.
3. Public and private watercraft access,
approach roads, and access-related parking areas may be placed
within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening and
erosion control conditions of this subpart are met. For private
facilities, the grading and filling provisions of Subd. 5C2 of this
section must be met.
E. Stormwater Management. The following general
and specific standards shall apply:
1. General Standards.
a. When possible, existing natural
drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to
convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before
discharge to public waters.
b. Development must be planned and
conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed
areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce the delay
runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected
as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
c. When development density,
topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not
sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural
features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities
such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to
designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather
than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities.
F. Special Provisions for Commercial, Industrial,
Public/Semipublic, Agricultural, Forestry and Extractive Uses and
Mining of Metallic Minerals and Peat.
10.20-27
1. Standards for Commercial, Industrial,
Public and Semipublic Uses.
a. All industrial uses proposed in the
"I-1" or "I-2" zoning districts and located in the "S" Shoreland
District require a conditional use permit in accordance with the
procedures and findings set forth in Section 10.2D, Subd. 5G and
Section 10.21 of the City Code.
b. Surface water-oriented commercial
uses and industrial, public, or semipublic uses with similar needs
to have access to and use of public waters may be located on parcels
or lots with frontage on public waters. Those uses with wateroriented
needs must meet the following standards:
(1) in addition to meeting
impervious coverage limits, setbacks, and other zoning standards in
this section, the uses must be designed to incorporate topographic
and vegetative screening of parking areas and structures;
(2) uses that require short-term
watercraft mooring for patrons must centralize these facilities and
design them to avoid obstructions and navigation and to be the
minimum size necessary to meet the need; and
(3) uses that depend on patrons
arriving by watercraft may use signs and lighting to convey needed
information to the public, subject to the following general
standards:
(a) no advertising signs or
supporting facilities for signs may be placed in or upon public
waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages may be
placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a
permit issued by the county sheriff;
(b) signs may be placed, when
necessary, within the shore impact zone if they are designed and
sized to be the minimum necessary to convey needed information.
They must only convey the location and name of the establishment
and the general types of goods or services available. The signs
must not contain other detailed information such as product brands
and prices, must not be located higher than ten (10) feet in size.
If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be shielded or
directed to prevent illumination out across public waters; and
10.20-28
c. Uses without water-oriented needs
must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage,
or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must
either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level
setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by
vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
2. Agricultural Use Standards.
a. General cultivation farming,
grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and
wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes and shore
and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or
operated under an approved conservation plan (Resource Management
Systems) consistent with the field office technical guides of the
local soil and water conservation districts or the United States
Soil Conservation Service, as provided by a qualified individual or
agency. The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted
agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet
from the ordinary high water level.
b. Animal feedlots must meet the
following standards:
(1) new feedlots must not be
located in the shoreland of watercourses or in bluff impact zones
and must meet a minimum setback of 300 feet from the ordinary high
water level of all public waters basins; and
(2) modifications or expansions to
existing feedlots that are located within 300 feet of the ordinary
high water level or within a bluff impact zone are allowed if they
do not further encroach into the existing ordinary high water level
setback or encroach on bluff impact zones.
3. Forest Management Standards. The
harvesting of timber and associated reforestation must be
conducted consistent with the provisions of the Minnesota Nonpoint
Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the provisions of Water
Quality in Forest Management "Best Management Practices in
Minnesota."
4. Extractive Use Standards.
a. Site Development and Restoration
Plan. An extractive use site development and restoration plan must
be developed, approved, and followed over the course of operation
10.20-29
of the site. The plan must address dust, noise, possible pollutant
discharges, hours and duration of operation, and anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations. It must also identify
actions to be taken during operation to mitigate adverse
environmental impacts, particularly erosion, and must clearly
explain how the site will be rehabilitated after extractive
activities end.
b. Setbacks for Processing Machinery.
Processing machinery must be located consistent with setback
standards for structures from ordinary high water levels of public
waters from bluffs.
5. Mining of Metallic Minerals and Peat.
Mining of metallic minerals and peat, as defined in Minn. Stat.
§93.44 to §93.51, are satisfied.
G. Conditional Uses. Conditional uses allowable
within shoreland areas shall be subject to the review and approval
procedures, and criteria and conditions for review of conditional
uses established under Section 10.21 of this Ordinance. The
following additional evaluation criteria and conditions apply within
shoreland areas:
1. Evaluation Criteria. A thorough
evaluation of the waterbody and the topographic, vegetation, and
soils conditions on the site must be made to ensure:
a. the prevention of soil erosion or
other possible pollution of public waters, both during and after
construction;
b. the visibility of structures and
other facilities as viewed from public waters is limited;
c. the site is adequate for water supply
and on-site sewage treatment; and
d. the types, uses, and numbers of
watercraft that the project will generate are compatible in relation
to the suitability of public waters to safely accommodate
these watercraft.
2. Conditions attached to conditional use
permits. The Alexandria City Council, upon consideration of the
criteria listed above and the purposes of this section, shall attach
such conditions to the issuance of the conditional use permits as
10.20-30
it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
a. increased setbacks from the ordinary
high water level;
b. limitations on the natural
vegetation to be removed or the requirement that additional
vegetation be planted; and
c. special provisions for the location,
design, and use of structures, sewage treatment systems, watercraft
launching and docking areas, and vehicle parking areas.
H. Water Supply and Sewage Treatment.
1. Water Supply. Any premises used for human
occupancy must be provided with an adequate water supply method as
follows:
a. Any private or public water supply
of water for domestic purposes must meet or exceed standards for
water quality of the Minnesota Department of health and the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
b. Private wells must be located,
constructed, maintained and sealed in accordance with or in a more
thorough manner than the Water Well Construction Code of the
Minnesota Department of Health.
2. Sewage Treatment. Any premises used for
human occupancy must be provided with an adequate method of sewage
treatment, as follows:
a. Publicly-owned sewer systems must be
used where available.
b. All private sewage treatment systems
must meet or exceed the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's
standards for individual sewage treatment systems contained in the
document titles, "Individual Sewage Treatment Systems Standards,
Chapter 7080", a copy of which is hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this section.
c. On-site sewage treatment systems
must be set back from the ordinary high water level in accordance
with the setbacks contained in Section 5B1 of this section.
10.20-31
d. All proposed sites for individual
sewage treatment systems shall be evaluated in accordance with the
criteria in subitems (1) - (4). If the determination of a site's
suitability cannot be made with publicly available existing
information, it shall then be the responsibility of the applicant
to provide sufficient soil borings and percolation tests from onsite
field investigations. The evaluation criteria are:
(1) depth to the highest known or
calculated ground water table or bedrock;
(2) soil conditions, properties,
and permeability;
(3) slope;
(4) the existence of lowland, local
surface depressions, and rock outcrops;
e. Nonconforming sewage treatment
systems shall be regulated and upgraded in accordance with Subd.
6A3 of this section.
Subd. 6. Nonconformities. All legally established
nonconformities as of the date of this ordinance may continue, but
they will be managed according to applicable state statutes and
Section 10.03, Subd. 1 of the City Code; except that the following
standards will also apply in shoreland areas:
A. Construction on Nonconforming Lots of Record.
1. Lots of record in the Office of the
Douglas County Recorder on the date of enactment of local shoreland
controls that do not meet the requirements of Subd. 5A of this
section may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot
size requirements provided the use is permitted in the
zoning district, the lot has been in separate ownership from
abutting lands at all times since it became substandard, was created
compliant with official controls in effect at the time, and sewage
treatment and setback requirements of this ordinance are met.
2. A variance from setback requirements must
be obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building
permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the Board
of Adjustment and Appeals shall consider sewage treatment and water
supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall deny the
variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
10.20-32
3. If, in a group of two or more contiguous
lots under the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the
requirements of Subd. 5A of this section the lot must not be
considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or
development. The lot must be combined with one or more contiguous
lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the
requirements of Subd. 5A of this section as much as possible.
B. Additions/Expansions to Nonconforming
Structures.
1. All additions or expansions to the outside
dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure must meet the
setback, height, and other requirements of Subd. 5 of this
ordinance. Any deviation from these requirements must be authorized
by a variance pursuant to Subd. 3C of this section.
2. Deck additions may be allowed without a
variance to a structure not meeting the required setback from the
ordinary high water level if all of the following criteria and
standards are met:
a. the structure existed on the date the
structure setbacks were established;
b. a thorough evaluation of the
property and structure reveals no reasonable location for a deck
meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high water level setback
of the structure:
c. the deck encroachment toward the
ordinary high water level does not exceed 15 percent of the existing
setback of the structure from the ordinary high water level or does
not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive; and
d. the deck is constructed primarily of
wood, and is not roofed or screened.
C. Nonconforming Sewage Treatment Systems.
1. A sewage treatment system not meeting the
requirement of Subd. 5H of this section must be upgraded, at a
minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required
for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes
of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered
10.20-33
nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment
system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
2. The City Council of the City of Alexandria
has by formal resolution notified the commissioner of its program
to identify nonconforming sewage treatment systems. The City of
Alexandria will require upgrading or replacement of any
nonconforming system identified by this program within a reasonable
period of time which will not exceed two (2) years. Sewage systems
installed according to all applicable local shoreland management
standards adopted under Minn. Stat. §105.485, in effect at the time
of installation may be considered as conforming unless they are
determined to be failing, except that systems unsign cesspools,
leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or
systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater
than required by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Chapter
7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be
considered nonconforming.
Subd. 7 Subdivision/Platting Provisions.
A. Land Suitability. Each lot created through
subdivision, including planned unit developments authorized under
Subd. 8 of this section, must be suitable in its natural state for
the proposed use with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis by
the local unit of government shall consider susceptibility to
flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with
severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep
topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment
capabilities, near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for waterbased
recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of
significant historic sites, or any other feature of the natural land
likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future
residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
B. Consistency with Other Controls. Subdivisions
must conform to all official controls of this community. A
subdivision will not be approved where a later variance from one or
more standards in official controls would be needed to use the lots
for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly owned
sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless
domestic water supply is available and sewage treatment system
consistent with Subd. 5B and 5H can be provided for every lot. Each
lot shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements of
Subd. 5A, including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that
is free of limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two
standard soil treatment systems. Lots that would require use of
10.20-34
holding tanks must not be approved.
C. Information Requirements. Sufficient
information must be submitted by the applicant for the City to make
a determination of land suitability. The information shall include
at least the following:
(1) topographic contours at ten (10) foot
intervals or less from United States Geological Survey maps or more
accurate sources, showing limiting site characteristics;
(2) the surface water features required in
Minn. Stat. §505.02, Subd. 1, to be shown on plats, obtained from
United States Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more
accurate sources;
(3) adequate soils formation to determine
suitability for building and on-site sewage treatment capabilities
for every lot from the most current existing sources or from field
investigations such as soil borings, percolation tests, or other
methods;
(4) information regarding adequacy of
domestic water supply; extent of anticipated vegetation and
topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic conditions, including
depths, types of bottom sediments, and aquatic vegetation; and
proposed methods for controlling stormwater runoff and erosion, both
during and after construction activities;
(5) location of 100 year flood plain areas and
floodway districts from existing adopted maps or data; and
(6) a line or contour representing the
ordinary high water level, the "toe" and the "top" of bluffs, and
the minimum building setback distances from the top of the bluff
and the lake or stream.
D. Dedications. When a land or easement
dedication is a condition of subdivision approval, the approval must
provide easements over natural drainage or ponding areas for
management of stormwater and significant wetlands.
E. Platting. All subdivisions that create two (2)
or more lots or parcels that are five (5) acres or less in size
shall be processed as a plat in accordance with Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 505 and Section 11 of this Ordinance. No permit for
construction of buildings or sewage treatment systems shall be
10.20-35
issued for lots created after these official controls were enacted
unless the lot was approved as part of a formal subdivision.
F. Controlled Access or Recreational Lots. Lots
intended as controlled accesses to public waters or for recreational
use areas for use by nonriparian lots within a subdivision must meet
or exceed the sizing criteria in Subd. 5A4 of this section.
Subd. 8. Planned Unit Developments (PUD's).
A. Types of PUD's Permissible. Planned Unit
Developments (PUD's) are allowed for new projects on undeveloped
land, redevelopment of previously built sites, or conversions of
existing buildings and land. The land use districts in which they
are an allowable use are identified in the land use district
descriptions in Subd. 4B of this section and the official zoning
map.
B. Processing PUD's. Planned Unit Developments
must be processed as a conditional use, except that an expansion to
an existing commercial PUD involving 6 or less new dwelling units
or sites since the date this ordinance was adopted is permissible
as a permitted use provided the total project density does not
exceed the allowable densities calculated in the project density
evaluation procedures in Subd. 8E. Approval cannot occur until the
environmental review process (EAW/EIS) is complete.
C. Application for a PUD. The applicant for a PUD
must submit the following documents prior to final action being
taken on the application request:
1. A site plan and/or plat for the projects
showing locations of property boundaries, surface water features,
existing and proposed structures and other facilities, land
alterations, sewage treatment and water supply systems (where public
systems will not be provided), topographic contours at ten-foot
intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined commercial and
residential development, the site plan and/or plat must indicate
and distinguish which buildings and portions of the project are
residential, commercial, or a combination of the two.
2. A property owners association agreement
(for residential PUD's) with mandatory membership, and all in
accordance with the requirements of Subd. 8F of this section.
3. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements or other instruments that: 1) properly address future
10.20-36
vegetative and topographic alterations, construction of additional
buildings, beaching of watercraft, and construction of commercial
buildings in residential PUD's; and 2) ensure the long-term
preservation and maintenance of open space in accordance with the
criteria and analysis specified in Subd. 8F of this section.
4. When necessary, a master plan/drawing
describing the project and the floor plan for all commercial
structures to be occupied.
5. Those additional documents as requested
by the Zoning Administrator that are necessary to explain how the
PUD will be designed and will function.
6. A Zoning District Amendment is required
as set forth in Section 10.21 of the City Code.
D. Site "Suitable Area" Evaluation. Proposed new
or expansions to existing planned unit developments must be
evaluated using the following procedures and standards to determine
the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density
evaluation in Subd. 8E.
1. The project parcel must be divided into
tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line
that identifies the ordinary high water level at the following
intervals, proceeding landward.
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
Unsewered Sewer
(feet) (feet)
General development lakes-first tier 200 200
General development lakes-second and
additional tiers 267 200
Recreational development lakes 267 267
Natural environmental lakes 400 320
All river classes 300 300
2. The suitable area within each tier is next
calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or
land below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This
suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either
the residential or commercial planned unit development density
evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units
or sites.
10.20-37
E. Residential and Commercial PUD Density
Evaluation. The procedures for determining the "base" density of a
PUD and density increase multiplier are as follows. Allowable
densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further
from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any other tier
closer.
1. Residential PUD "Base" Density
Evaluation. The suitable area within each tier is divided up by
the single residential lot size standard for lakes or, for rivers,
the single residential lot width standard times the tier depth,
unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative
minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base
density of dwelling units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations
and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned
unit developments are then compared with the tier, density, and
suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in Subd. 8F.
2. Commercial PUD "Base" Density Evaluation:
a. Determine the average inside living
area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including
both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside
living area sizes need not include decks, patios, stoops, steps,
garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
b. Select the appropriate floor area
ration from the following table:
Commercial Planned Unit Development

1,500 .150 .075 .038
*For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area
ratios listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown,
use the ratios listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational
camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400 square feet.
Manufactured home sites in recreational camping areas shall use a
ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home or if unknown, the
ratio listed for 1,000 square feet.
c. Multiply the suitable area within
each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each
tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or site.
d. Divide the total floor area by tier
computed in Item C above by the average inside living areas size
determined in Item A above. This yields a base number of dwelling
units and sites for each tier.
e. Proposed locations and numbers of
dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned unit development
are then compared with the tier, density and suitability analyses
herein and the design criteria in Subd. 8F.
3. Density Increase Multipliers:
a. Increases to the dwelling unit or
dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if
the dimensional standards in Subd. 5 are met or exceeded and the
design criteria in Subd. 8F are satisfied. The allowable density
increases in Item (b) below will only be allowed if structure
setbacks from the ordinary high water level are increased to at
least 50 percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on
the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative
management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the local
unit of government and the setback is at least 25 percent greater
10.20-39
than the minimum setback.
b. Allowable Dwelling Unit or Dwelling
Site Density Increases for Residential or Commercial Planned Unit
Developments:
Maximum Density Increase
Density Evaluation Tiers Within Each Tier (Percent)
First 50%
Second 100%
Third 200%
Fourth 200%
Fifth 200%
F. Maintenance and Design Criteria.
1. Maintenance and Administration
Requirements.
a. Before final approval of a planned
unit development, adequate provisions must be developed for
preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for
the continued existence and functioning of the development.
b. Open space preservation. Deed
restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and
acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means must be
provided to ensure long-term preservation and maintenance of open
space. The instruments must include all of the following
protections:
(1) commercial uses prohibited (for
residential PUD's);
(2) vegetation and topographic
alterations other than routine maintenance prohibited;
(3) construction of additional
buildings or storage of vehicles and other materials prohibited;
and
(4) uncontrolled beaching of
watercraft prohibited.
c. Development organization and
functioning. Unless an equally effective alternative community
10.20-40
framework is established, when applicable, all residential planned
unit developments must use an owners association with the following
features:
(1) membership must be mandatory
for each dwelling unit or site purchaser and any successive
purchasers;
(2) each member must pay a pro rata
share of the association's expenses, and unpaid assessments can
become liens on units or sites;
(3) assessments must be adjustable
to accommodate changing conditions; and
(4) the association must be
responsible for insurance, taxes, and maintenance of all commonly
owned property and facilities.
2. Open Space Requirements. Planned unit
developments must contain open space meeting all of the following
criteria:
a. at least 50 percent of the total
project area must be preserved as open space;
b. dwelling units or sites, road rightof-
ways, or land covered by road surfaces, parking areas, or
structures, except water-oriented accessory structures or
facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space;
c. open space must include areas with
physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural
state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted
cemeteries;
d. open space may include outdoor
recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling units or
sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling units or sites, and
by the general public;
e. open space may include subsurface
sewage treatment systems if the use of the space is restricted to
avoid adverse impacts on the systems;
10.20-41
f. open space must not include
commercial facilities or uses, but may contain water-oriented
accessory structures or facilities;
g. the appearance of open space areas,
including topography vegetation, and allowable uses, must be
preserved by use of restrictive deed covenants, permanent easements,
public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and
permanent means; and
h. the shore impact zone, based on
normal structure setbacks, must be included as open space. For
residential PUD's, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone area
of existing developments or at least 70 percent of the shore impact
zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural or
existing state. For commercial PUD's, at least 50 percent of the
shore impact zone must be preserved in its natural state.
3. Erosion Control and Stormwater
Management. Erosion control and stormwater management plans must
be developed and the PUD must:
a. be designed, and the construction
managed, to minimize the likelihood of serious erosion occurring
either during or after construction. This must be accomplished by
limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground exposure.
Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated
buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be used to
minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control
plans approved by a soil and water conservation district may be
required if project size and site physical characteristics warrant;
and
b. be designed and constructed to
effectively manage reasonably expected quantities and qualities of
stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within any tier must
not exceed 25 percent of the tier area, except that for commercial
PUD's 35 percent impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the
first tier of general development lakes with an approved stormwater
management plan and consistency with Subd. 5C.
4. Centralization and Design of Facilities.
Centralization and design of facilities and structures must be done
according to the following standards:
a. planned unit developments must be
connected to publicly owned water supply and sewer systems, if
10.20-42
available. On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems must
be centralized and designed and installed to meet or exceed
applicable standards or rules of the Minnesota Department of Health
and Subd. 5B and Subd. 5H of this section. On-site sewage treatment
systems must be located on the most suitable areas of the
development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors must
be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for each sewage
system;
b. dwelling units or sites must be
clustered into one or more groups and located on suitable areas of
the development. They must be designed and located to meet or
exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant
shoreland classification; setback from the ordinary high water
level, elevation above the surface water features, and maximum
height. Setbacks from the ordinary high water level must be
increased in accordance with Subd. 8E3 of this ordinance for
developments with density increases;
c. shore recreation facilities,
including but not limited to swimming areas, docks, and watercraft
mooring areas and launching ramps, must be centralized and located
in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability must include
consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth
to groundwater and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number
of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring or docking of
watercraft must not exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or
site in the first tier (notwithstanding existing mooring sites in
an existing commercially used harbor). Launching ramp facilities,
including a small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be
provided for use by occupant of dwelling units or sites located in
other tiers;
d. structures, parking areas, and other
facilities must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from
public waters and adjacent shoreland by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the local
unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative
and topographic screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be
required to be provided;
e. accessory structures and facilities,
except water oriented accessory structures, must meet the required
principal structure setback and must be centralized; and
f. water-oriented accessory structures
and facilities may be allowed if they meet or exceed design standards
10.20-43
contained in Subd. 5B of this ordinance and are centralized.
G. Conversions. Local governments may allow
existing resorts or other land uses and facilities to be converted
to residential planned unit developments if all of the following
standards are met:
1. Proposed conversions must be initially
evaluated using the same procedures for residential planned unit
developments involving all new construction. Inconsistencies
between existing features of the development and these standards
must be identified.
2. Deficiencies involving water supply and
sewage treatment, structure color, impervious coverage, open space,
and shore recreation facilities must be corrected as part of the
conversion or as specified in the conditional use permit.
3. Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies
must be evaluated and reasonable improvements made as part of the
conversion. These improvements must include, where applicable, the
following:
a. removal of extraneous buildings,
docks, or other facilities that no longer need to be located in
shore or bluff impact zones;
b. remedial measures to correct erosion
sites and improve vegetative cover and screening of buildings and
other facilities as viewed from the water; and
c. if existing dwelling units are
located in shore or bluff impact zones, conditions are attached to
approvals of conversions that preclude exterior expansions in any
dimension or substantial alterations. The conditions must also
provide for future relocation of dwelling units, where feasible, to
other locations, meeting all setback and elevation requirements when
they are built or replaced.
4. Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site
densities that exceed standards in Subd. 8E may be allowed to
continue but must not be allowed to be increased, either at the time
of conversion or in the future. Efforts must be made during the
conversion to limit impacts of high densities by requiring seasonal
use, improving vegetative screening, centralizing shore recreation
facilities, installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means.
10.21-1
Section 10.21. "PUD" Planned Unit Development District
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of the "PUD" Planned Unit
Development District is to permit great flexibility in the use and
design of structures and land in situation where modification of
specific provisions of this Ordinance would not be contrary to its
intent and purpose or significantly be inconsistent with the
planning on which it is based, and will not be harmful to the
neighborhood in which the district occurs. The PUD process, by
allowing deviation from the strict district and performance
standards may allow:
A. Variety: Within a comprehensive site design
concept a mixture of land uses, housing types, and densities.
B. Sensitivity: By departing from the strict
application of required performance standards associated with
traditional zoning, planned unit development can maximize the
development potential of land while remaining sensitive to its
unique and valuable natural and scenic characteristics.
C. Efficiency: The consolidation of areas for
recreation and reductions in street lengths and other utilityrelated
expenses.
D. Density Transfer: The project density may be
clustered, basing density on number of units per acre instead of
specific lot dimensions.
E. District Integration: The combination of uses
which are allowed in separate zoning districts such as:
a. Mixed residential allows both densities and
unit types to be varied within the PUD.
b. Mixed commercial, residential, or
institutional land use with the integration of compatible land
uses within the PUD.
F. Infill: Encourage infill within areas of the
city which are characterized by existing development.
Subd. 2. Permitted Uses. The following are permitted
uses in the "PUD" District:
All permitted and conditional uses allowed in
Sections 10.05 through 10.17 of this Ordinance.
10.21-2
Subd. 3. Accessory Uses. The following are
permitted accessory uses in the "PUD" District:
All accessory uses allowed in Sections 10.05 through
10.17 of this Ordinance.
The uses allowed in a “PUD” District must be in conformance with
the district where the PUD is proposed.
Subd. 4. Procedural Requirements.
A. The establishment of "PUD" District shall be
subject to the amendment requirements as outlined in Section 10.23
of this Ordinance.
B. When reviewing proposals for PUDs in the
shoreland area as defined in the City Code, staff shall consider
whether the PUD proposal meets the standards and criteria in
Section 10.20, Subdivision 8(Shoreland District, Planned Unit
Development). If there is a case where the standards and criteria
in Section 10.20, Subdivision 8 are not consistent with those in
this section, the most restrictive standards shall apply.
C. Requests for variances of this Ordinance may be
approved when such requests are consistent with the purpose of this
section. Any requests for the platting or replatting of property
within the "PUD" District shall include recording of the final plan
and/or subdivision plat with the Douglas County Recorder.
D. Upon approval of the Planned Unit Development,
the Zoning Administrator shall record the "PUD" District onto the
Zoning Map and designate the district as PUD-1. Thereafter, future
approved PUD Districts shall be designated in sequential order,
i.e., PUD-2, PUD-3, PUD-4, etc.
Subd. 5. Bonus Density
A. Purpose for Bonus Densities. Bonus densities
are intended to provide incentives to encourage the development of
affordable housing, provide additional public amenities or preserve
valuable natural or cultural resources and features. The
satisfaction of any of the bonus density criteria specified in
Subdivision D of this section is considered to be in the public
interest and worthy of a bonus density.
B. Eligibility for Bonus Densities. Eligibility
to obtain a bonus density is based upon site plan review and approval
by the City as part of the preliminary PUD Plan process. Such bonus
10.21-3
densities may be granted to deserving applications if the PUD plan
submitted is judged by the City to have achieved one or more of the
bonus density criteria.
C. Maximum Bonus Density. The maximum bonus
density allowed is limited to an additional 20 percent over the
density allowed in the underlying zone district. In addition to
criteria provided in this subdivision, the density shall be
compatible with the site’s natural constraints and the character
and density of the surrounding area. Compatibility for bonus
density shall also be determined by proximity of the site to arterial
roads, transit service, employment and shopping areas and planned
amenities.
D. Basis for Approval of Bonus Density. Upon
submittal of the Preliminary PUD application, the City shall review
the proposed project and submit recommendations and proposed
findings of fact and conclusions with respect to the allocation of
bonus densities for the project to the Planning Commission. The
allocation of bonus densities should be based upon a comprehensive
review of the entire project. It is the intention of this section
to allow bonus densities where a PUD applicant proposes design
attributes providing public benefits in addition to those required
by local, state of federal land use or environmental regulations.
Bonus densities will not be allowed for site design proposals,
which merely reflect mandatory requirements of local, state and
federal codes or regulations. Consideration of the following
criteria should be given, but need not be limited to these:
1. Preservation of Open Space and Natural,
Historical and Cultural Features (Exceeding Mandatory Code
Requirements).
Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include
the preservation and minimum disturbance of natural features and
wildlife habitat; preservation of unique historical or cultural
features; preservation of open space; dedication to the City of
land within the City’s potential park or open space areas and
corridor as designated in the comprehensive plan; and preservation
of air, sunlight and scenic resources.
2. Public Service and Facility Availability
(Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements).
Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include
the provision of public schools; public park or other public
facilities and/or sites; bicycle and pedestrian pathway systems;
10.21-4
and special site design for special needs residents to situate or
cluster uses within a reasonable distance of fire and police
protection, medical, shopping, church and other such amenities.
3. Energy Efficiency (Exceeding Mandatory
Code Requirements).
Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include
preservation of solar access; south orientation with added glazing
for inhabited structures; the use of landscaping and topography
for windbreaks and shading; common wall construction;
transportation management strategies, the use of solar energy
systems either passive or active for heating and/or cooling; energy
conserving design of roadways and other structures; and higher
insulation levels.
4. Public Recreation Facilities (Exceeding
Mandatory Code Requirements).
Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include
provision for public recreational features such as tennis courts,
active play areas, swimming pools, passive open space areas,
bicycle and pedestrian pathway systems.
5. Environmental Design (Exceeding Mandatory
Code Requirements).
Items for consideration in this section may include onsite
designs providing regional benefits, including drainage control
using natural drainage and landscaped drainage retention
facilities; significant public access provided to designated
potential open space or park areas, shoreline areas, trails, scenic
sites and viewpoints; provision for substantial and exceptional
landscape treatment; and the use of recycled materials and resource
conserving designs.
6. Affordable Housing (Exceeding Mandatory
Code Requirements).
Items for consideration include the provision of a mix of
housing types, utilization of townhouses, condominiums and
apartments directed to providing a reasonable mix or diversity of
bona fide affordable housing opportunities for a diverse segment
of the community. Bonus densities will also be allowed for projects
providing affordable housing in market rate developments. In such
developments and other developments seeking bonus densities for
the provision of affordable housing opportunities, the amount of
10.21-5
bonus will be linked to the level of affordability, i.e., the lower
the cost or rental rate per unit, the greater the bonus afforded
to the development. Density bonuses for affordable housing
projects will be granted only where all of the following conditions
are satisfied:
a. The developer must agree to sell or
rent the units to qualifying residents;
b. The developer must ensure the
continued affordability of the units by qualified residents for a
minimum of 40 years through the use of restrictive covenants or
other deed restrictions approved by the city; and
c. The units must be of an innovative
design and compatible with existing neighborhood character, with
adequate assurances that such design and compatibility will be
maintained throughout the 40-year period.
7. Other suitable items believed by the City
to be worthy of consideration may also be included as bonus density
criteria.
Subd. 6. Planned Unit Development; Type, Process,
Application, Approval and Decision Criteria, and Open and
Recreation Space Requirements.
A. Types of planned unit developments – Where
permitted.
1. Two types of planned unit developments are
established:
a. Single-family PUDs, comprising
detached dwelling units on individual lots; the necessary streets
and other public and/or private rights-of-way to serve such
dwelling units; and any appurtenant common open space,
recreational facilities or other areas or facilities. Proposals
for single-family PUDs are allowed in the R-1, R-1A, and R-2 zoning
districts.
b. Non-single-family PUDs, comprising
attached dwelling units, detached dwelling units not on individual
lots, retail, office, service or industrial buildings, or any
combination thereof, the necessary streets and other public and/or
private rights-of-way to serve such uses, and any appurtenant
common open space, recreational facilities or other areas or
10.21-6
facilities. Proposals for non-single family PUDs are allowed in
the R-3, B-1, B-2, R-B, I-1, I-2, and I-B districts
A PUD may comprise both of the above types, subject to
compliance with the use regulations of the zone in which the PUD
is proposed to be located.
B. Preliminary and final approval required – Type
of action – Combined applications.
1. Each PUD shall require a pre-application
conference, preliminary and final approval. Both preliminary and
final PUD approvals shall be processed in accordance with the
procedures for such actions as set forth in this Code.
2. Prior to the submittal of an application
for a PUD, the applicant shall schedule a pre-application
conference with the City’s Development Review Team. The primary
purpose of the conference shall be to provide the applicant with
an opportunity to gather information and obtain guidance as to the
general suitability of the proposal for the area which it is
proposed and its conformity to the provisions of this section
before incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans,
surveys and other data. At least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting, the applicant shall submit a concept plan containing the
following information:
a. Overall maximum PUD density.
b. Specific location of major streets
and pedestrian ways.
c. Location and extent of public and
common open space.

development.
e. Other special criteria for
development.
f. Specific location of residential
and nonresidential land uses with approximate type and intensities
of development.
10.21-7
g. Narrative describing how the
proposed development will be superior or more innovative than
conventional development undertaken through the City’s land use
regulations. The statement shall also substantiate how the
proposed PUD will provide a benefit to the public beyond what is
available through conventional development.
3. The preliminary development plan and the
final development plan may be combined and together processed
through review as a final development plan. In addition, the
applicant may file a concurrent subdivision application, in
accordance with the procedures as set forth in this Code and/or a
concurrent rezone application, in accordance with the procedures
as set forth in this Code, which application(s) shall be processed
concurrently with the PUD application(s).
C. Phased development.
1. Development of the project may be phased,
in which case each complete phase may be processed separately
through both preliminary development plan review and final
development plan review. A map showing all property owned or
controlled by the developer which is contiguous to the development
site or which is within the area determined by the community
development director to be relevant for comprehensive planning and
environmental assessment purposes, together with a conceptual plan
of said properties’ eventual development through all potential
phases, shall be submitted with the application for the first
phase. The developer is not responsible for providing a conceptual
plan for contiguous or nearby property which is not owned or
controlled by the developer. The conceptual plan shall conform to
the purposes of this chapter and shall be used by the city to
review all phases of the development. All phases of the development
shall conform to the conceptual plan, all conditions of approval,
and applicable regulations.
D. Preliminary PUDs – Contents of complete
application.
1. The applicant shall file with the City a
preliminary development plan, including the following:
a. A legal description of the property
proposed to be developed;
b. A map of the subject property and
surrounding area determined by the City to be relevant for
10.21-8
comprehensive planning, environmental assessment or zoning review
purposes, which map shall depict comprehensive plan designations,
zoning classifications and existing land uses, including streets;
c. A proposed site plan for the subject
property depicting the following:

(3) Designated placement,
location, and principal dimensions of lots, buildings, streets,
parking areas, recreation areas and other open space, landscaping
areas and utilities;
(4) If the developer owns or
otherwise controls property adjacent to the proposed development,
a conceptual plan for such property demonstrating that it can be
developed in a compatible manner with the proposed development;
d. A conceptual landscape plan showing
existing and proposed landscaping, in accordance with the
requirements of this Code.
e. Drawing and/or text showing scale,
bulk and architectural character of proposed structures;
f. For PUDs proposed in the R-1 or R-2
zoning district, a conceptual drawing depicting the number and
location of lots, which would be allowed if no regulations were
modified;
g. Special features including but not
limited to critical areas and sites or structures of historic
significance;
h. A text describing conditions or
features, which cannot be adequately displayed, on maps or
drawings;
i. A narrative stating how the proposed
development complies with the goals and policies of the
Comprehensive Plan, including level of service standards and
10.21-9

City, or by any other section of this Code.
2. The applicant may submit to the City
proposed development standards which, if approved by the city
council, shall become a part of the preliminary plan in lieu of
the requirement of subsection (A)(2) of this section for specifying
placement, location and principal dimensions of buildings,
streets, and parking areas. This alternative process is intended
to accommodate the need for flexibility in large-scale non-singlefamily
developments, while insuring that sufficient information as
to the nature of the development is available upon which to base
a decision concerning the preliminary development plan. Proposed
development standards shall specifically set forth parameters for
location, dimensions and design of buildings, streets and parking
areas.
E. Preliminary PUDs – Criteria for approval.
Preliminary PUD approval shall be granted by the city only if
the applicant demonstrates that:
1. The proposed project shall not be
detrimental to present and potential surrounding land use.
2. Land surrounding the proposed
development can be planned in coordination with the proposed
development and can be developed so as to be mutually compatible.
3. Streets and sidewalks, existing and
proposed, are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic
within the proposed project and in the vicinity of the proposed
project, in light of the criteria set forth in this Code and in
compliance with transportation level of service standards and
guidelines contained in the comprehensive plan.
10.21-10
4. Services including potable water,
sanitary sewer and storm drainage are available or can be provided
by the development prior to occupancy so as to comply with level
of service standards or guidelines contained in the comprehensive
plan.

processed concurrently, conformance with the requirements of City
Code Section 11.
F. Preliminary PUDs – Minor and major changes to
an approved preliminary PUD.
1. A proposed minor change to an approved
PUD shall be incorporated into the application for final PUD
approval, and any notification regarding such final PUD approval
shall describe the proposed minor change(s). A “minor change” means
any departure from the conditions of preliminary approval, which
is not a “major change” and includes but is not limited to the
following:
a. Reductions in the number of dwelling
units in a structure;
b. Reductions in the number of
nonresidential structures;
c. Reductions in the heights of
structures;
d. Revisions to location of internal
roads;
e. Revisions similar in nature to those
above as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
10.21-11
2. A proposed change to an approved
preliminary PUD shall require reapplication for preliminary PUD
approval as set forth in this Code and any notification regarding
such preliminary PUD approval shall describe the proposed major
change or changes. A major change is any departure from the
conditions of preliminary PUD approval, which would result in any
of the following:
a. Revisions to the approved design
concept;
b. Revisions to the approved use(s);
c. An increase in the number of
residential dwelling units;
d. An increase in square footage of
nonresidential structures;
e. A decrease in the amount of
landscaping, site perimeter buffering, and open space; and
f. An increase in traffic volumes or
change in circulation patterns which impacts surrounding
development.
A. Final PUDs – Contents of complete
application.
Within 12 months following the approval of the preliminary
PUD, the applicant shall file with the City a final PUD conforming
to the approved preliminary PUD, including any proposed minor
changes pursuant to this Code. Should the approved preliminary
PUD include a preliminary subdivision, the applicant shall file a
final development plan within the time period required by law.
Such a final subdivision shall not be approved unless and until
the associated final PUD is approved. In addition to the
information required under Section 11 of this Code for the
preliminary PUD, the final PUD shall include the following:
1. A survey of the property, showing for all
areas to be developed or disturbed existing features, including
topography at two-foot contours, buildings, structures, trees over
eight inches in trunk diameter measured four feet above the base
of the trunk, streets, utility easements, rights-of-way, and
existing land uses;
10.21-12
2. Elevation and perspective drawings of
project structures and improvements;
3. Proposed final conditions, covenants and
restrictions (CC&Rs) and other documents relating to operation and
maintenance of the development, including all of its open areas
and recreational facilities, which CC&Rs and other documents shall
be recorded upon final PUD approval;
4. Proposed final agreements, which may have
been required as conditions of preliminary PUD approval;
5. A development schedule, if development
may extend over more than a two-year period;
6. The following plans and diagrams:
a. An off-street parking plan;
b. A circulation diagram indicating
the proposed movement of vehicles and pedestrians within the
planned unit development, and to and from existing and programmed
thoroughfares; any special engineering features and traffic
regulating devices needed to facilitate or insure the safety of
this circulation pattern must be shown;
c. Landscaping and tree planting plan,
including site grading;
d. A topographic map or model of the
site and surrounding vicinity;
e. Final drainage plan.
7. In the event that development standards
were submitted and approved as part of the preliminary development
plan pursuant to this code, development standards shall be made
binding upon all future developers of the property in a manner
acceptable to the city, and may be submitted in lieu of elevation
and perspective drawings of project structures and improvements.
H. Final PUDs – Criteria for approval.
Final PUD approval shall be granted by the city only if the
applicant demonstrates that the final PUD substantially conforms
to the approved preliminary PUD, including minor changes. For the
purposes of this section, “substantially conforms” means that, as
10.21-13
compared to the preliminary PUD, the final PUD contains no
revisions in density, uses, design or development standards or in
the site plan, other than the minor changes.
I. Final PUDs – Extension of time for filing.
For good cause shown, the city council, in its discretion,
may grant an extension of time of one year for filing the final
PUD and required accompanying papers, and may grant additional
one-year extensions; provided, however, the city shall have the
right to re-examine and update any conditions made to mitigate
development impact.
J. Final PUDs – Failure to file – Termination.
1. In the event the final PUD or any
required attendant papers are not filed within 12 months following
approval of a preliminary PUD, except as provided in this Code,
the approval of the preliminary PUD shall lapse and the approval
shall be deemed null and void and without force or effect.
2. When it is determined as part of the
preliminary PUD approval that the final PUD is to be phased, the
final PUD for the first phase shall be submitted within 12 months
of preliminary approval. The final development plan for each
subsequent phase shall be submitted within the schedule
established at the time of preliminary PUD approval. In the case
of a PUD, which includes a subdivision, the final PUD shall be
submitted within five years of receiving preliminary approval.
3. The time period for filing of final PUDs
shall not include periods of time during which progress on the
final PUD was reasonably halted or delayed due to the filing and
pendency of legal actions challenging an approval granted by the
city pursuant to this chapter; provided, that in all cases when
more than two years have elapsed subsequent to the date of approval
of a preliminary PUD, whether due to the pendency of litigation,
city approved extensions of time for filing or otherwise, the
permittee shall be required to comply with all current building,
construction, subdivision and other applicable standards of the
city prior to being granted approval of the final PUD.
K. Final PUDs – Adjustments to approved final
PUD.
Adjustments to an approved final PUD shall be processed in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
10.21-14
1. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to
allow adjustments in accordance with subsection B of this section.
The Zoning Administrator shall allow only such adjustments as are
consistent with guidelines established in subsection B of this
section, and in no case shall an adjustment be allowed if it will
increase the total amount of floor space authorized in the approved
final PUD, or the number of dwelling units or density, or decrease
the amount of parking or loading facilities or permit buildings to
locate substantially closer to any boundary line or change
substantially any point of ingress or egress to the site.
2. For the purposes of this section,
“adjustments” means any departure from the conditions of final PUD
approval, which complies with the following criteria:
a. The adjustment maintains the design
intent and quality of the original approval;
b. The amount of landscaping,
buffering and open space shall not be reduced;
c. The number of dwelling units in
residential developments and the square footage of nonresidential
structures shall not increase;
d. The adjustment shall not relocate a
building, street or other use more than 20 feet in any direction
and shall not reduce any required yard and/or setback;
e. The height of buildings and other
structures shall not increase;
f. Views from both structures on-site
and off-site shall not be substantially reduced;
g. Traffic volumes shall not increase
and circulation patterns shall not change;
h. Changes in colors, plant material
and parking lot configurations are minor;
i. The adjustment does not add
significant new environmental impacts or significantly increase
environmental impacts disclosed in the original documents;
10.21-15
j. The Zoning Administrator determines
that the change will not increase any adverse impacts or
undesirable effects of the project, or that the change in no way
significantly alters the project.
L. Bond required for final PUD.
No final PUD shall be implemented until the applicant files
with the city a bond approved by the city, executed by a surety
company authorized to do business in the state, or other equivalent
security approved by the city attorney, in an amount equal to the
City’s estimate of the cost of all public improvements, utilities,
and all landscaping portions of the final PUD, conditioned upon
the permittee’s completion of such portions of the project
according to the submitted final PUD and the provisions of this
chapter, and, in addition, providing that no change, extension of
time, alteration or addition to the project will in any way affect
the obligation on the bond. Said bond, or an additional bond or
other equivalent security, shall also be conditioned upon full
restoration of the site in the event that grading, clearing or any
other site preparation or work is begun and abandoned, and in the
determination of the city, it will better serve the public health,
welfare and safety to restore the site rather than to require
completion of public improvements, utilities and landscaping. If
the PUD is also being subdivided, the bonds required to be posted
by this Code, to the extent that they satisfy the requirements of
this section, shall be accepted as full or partial fulfillment of
the requirements hereof.
M. Building permits – Certificates of occupancy –
Common walls.
1. The city shall issue building permits for
buildings and structures, which conform with the approved final
PUD and with all other applicable city ordinances and regulations.
The city shall issue a certificate of occupancy for completed
buildings or structures which conform to the requirements of the
approved final PUD and all other applicable city ordinances and
regulations. The construction and development of all the open
spaces and public and recreational facilities of each project phase
must be completed or bonded before any certificate of occupancy
will be issued.
2. In PUD projects receiving final approval,
where units will have common walls, the city may issue building
permits for construction of those units prior to approval of final
lot lines.
10.21-16
N. Extension of time for construction.
For good cause shown, the city council, in its discretion,
may grant one extension of time for commencement or continuation
of construction subsequent to approval of the final PUD.
O. Planned Unit Development plan - Decision
criteria.
The City may approve or approve with modifications a Planned
Unit Development plan if:
1. The Planned Unit Development is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan; and
2. The Planned Unit Development
accomplishes, by the use of permitted flexibility and variation in
design, a development that is better than that resulting from
traditional development. Net benefit to the City may be
demonstrated by one or more of the following:
a. Placement, type, number or reduced

Section 10.24. Signs.
Subd. 1. Purpose and Findings. The purpose and
findings of the sign ordinance is as follows:
A. Purpose: The sign ordinance is intended to establish a
Comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that
accommodates the need for a well-maintained, safe, and
attractive community, and the need for effective
communications including business identification. It is
the intent of this section, to promote the health,
safety, general welfare, aesthetics, and image of the
community by regulating signs that are intended to
communicate to the public, and to use signs which meet
the City's goals by authorizing:
1) permanent signs that establish a high standard
of aesthetics;
2) signs that are compatible with their surroundings;
3) signs that are designed, constructed, installed and
maintained in a manner that does not adversely
impact public safety or unduly distract motorists;
4) signs that are large enough to convey the intended
message and to help citizens find their way to
intended destinations;
5) signs that are proportioned to the scale of, and
are architecturally compatible with, principal
structures;
6) permanent signs which give preference to the onpremise
owner or occupant; and
7) temporary signs and advertising displays which
provide an opportunity for grand openings and
special events while restricting signs that create
continuous visual clutter and hazards at public
right-of-way intersections.
B. Findings: The City of Alexandria finds it is necessary
for the promotion and preservation of the public health,
safety, welfare and aesthetics of the community that the
construction, location, size and maintenance of signs be
controlled. Further, the City finds:
10.24-2
1) permanent and temporary signs have a direct impact
on and relationship to the image of the community;
2) the manner of installation, location and
maintenance of signs affects the public health,
safety, welfare and aesthetics of the community;
3) an opportunity for viable identification of
community businesses and institutions must be
established;
4) the safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and
other users of public streets and property are
affected by the number, size, location and
appearance of signs that unduly divert the
attention of drivers;
5) installation of signs suspended from, projecting
over, or placed on the tops of buildings, walks or
other structures may constitute a hazard during
periods of high winds and an obstacle to effective
fire-fighting and other emergency service;
6) uncontrolled and unlimited signs adversely impact
the image and aesthetic attractiveness of the
community and thereby undermine economic value and
growth;
7) uncontrolled and unlimited signs, particularly
temporary signs which are commonly located within
or adjacent to public right-of-way or are located
at driveway/street intersections, result in
roadside clutter and obstruction of views of
oncoming traffic. This creates a hazard to drivers
and pedestrians and also adversely impacts a
logical flow of information;
8) commercial speech signs are generally incompatible
with residential uses and should be strictly
limited in residential zoning districts; and
9) the right to express noncommercial opinions in any
zoning district must be protected, subject to
reasonable restrictions on size, height, location
and number.
10.24-3
Subd 2. Application of Regulations and Substitution
Clause. This section shall apply to the location, erection, and
maintenance of signs in all zoning districts within the City of
Alexandria, Minnesota. The owner of any sign which is otherwise
allowed by this Section of City Code may substitute non-commercial
copy or message in lieu of any other commercial or non-commercial
sign copy or message without any additional approval or permitting
subject to the operational standards set forth herein. The purpose
of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of
commercial speech or message over non-commercial speech or
message. This provision prevails over any more specific provision
to the contrary.
Subd 3. Severability. If any section, subsection,
subdivision, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Section is for
any reason held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of the Section. The City
Council hereby declares that it would have adopted any section,

of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections,
subdivisions, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid

Subd. 14. Dynamic Displays.
A. Findings. Studies show that there is a correlation between
dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway
drivers. Distraction can lead to traffic accidents. Drivers
can be distracted not only by a changing message, but also
by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers
may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur.
Drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell
the full story in one look. People have a natural desire
to see the end of the story and will continue to look at
the sign in order to wait for the end. Additionally,
drivers are more distracted by special effects used to
change the message, such as fade-ins and fade-outs.
Finally, drivers are generally more distracted by messages
that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more
than a simple message. Time and temperature signs appear
to be an exception to these concerns because the messages
are short, easily absorbed, and become inaccurate without
frequent changes.
Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to
allowing new technologies to easily update messages. Except
as prohibited by state or federal law, sign owners should
have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain
restrictions. The restrictions are intended to minimize
potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation
in residential districts where signs can adversely impact
residential character.
Local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal
opportunity to use such technologies and are not included.
Without those requirements, however, there is the potential
for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway.
If more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given
location on a road, the minimum display time becomes
critical. If the display time is too short, a driver could
be subjected to a view that appears to have constant
movement. This impact would obviously be compounded in a
corridor with multiple signs. If dynamic displays become
pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each
sign's ability to change frequently, drivers may be
subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory
overload. Therefore, a longer display time is appropriate.
A constant message is typically needed on a sign so that
the public can use it to identify and find an intended
10.24-23
destination. Changing messages detract from this wayfinding
purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct
through last-second lane changes, stops, or turns, which
could result in traffic accidents. Accordingly, dynamic
displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the
entire copy and graphic area of a sign.
In conclusion, the city finds that dynamic displays should
be allowed on signs but with significant controls to
minimize their proliferation and their potential threats
to public safety.
B. Regulations. Dynamic displays on signs are allowed subject
to the following conditions:
1. Dynamic displays are allowed only on freestanding signs
for conditionally permitted uses in residential
districts. They are allowed on wall signs and
freestanding signs in all other zoning districts.
2. Signs less than 200 square feet: Dynamic displays may
occupy no more than 40% of the sign area, up to a
maximum of 40 square feet. The remainder of the sign
must not have the capability for dynamic displays. Only
one, contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a
sign face.
3. Signs greater than 200 square feet: Dynamic display may
occupy up to 100% of the sign area and may change
messages no more frequently than once every 20 minutes.
Changes between messages must be achieved by
instantaneous re-pixelization.
4. Flashing dynamic displays are prohibited.
5. Dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze
the device in one position if a malfunction occurs. The
displays must also be equipped with a means to
immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions,
and the sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic
display when notified by the city that it is not
complying with the standards of this ordinance;
6. Dynamic displays must comply with the brightness
standards contained in subdivision 17;
10.24-24
7. Dynamic displays existing on the effective date of this
ordinance must comply with the operational standards
listed above. An existing dynamic display that does not
meet the structural requirements 2 and 3 above may
continue as a non-conforming use;
8. Audio speakers or any form of pyrotechnics are
prohibited in association with the dynamic display;
9. Video display signs must be wall signs and may be a
maximum of eight square feet.
10. One dynamic display sign is allowed per parcel.
11. Unless permitted as on off-premise sign no dynamic sign
will display messages or images of off-premise
advertising.
12. The images and messages displayed must be complete in
themselves, without continuation in content to the next
image or message or to any other sign. Signs existing
on the effective date of this ordinance that utilize
this technique may continue as a non-conforming use
until the sign is replaced or, if feasible, be
reprogrammed to conform to this section.
C. Incentives. Off-premise signs do not need to serve the
same way-finding function as do on-premises signs. Further,
new off-premise signs are strictly limited in the city,
and there is no potential that they will proliferate.
Finally, off-premise signs are in themselves distracting
and their removal serves public safety. The city is
extremely limited in its ability to cause the removal of
those signs. This section is intended to provide incentives
for the voluntary and uncompensated removal of off-premise
signs in certain settings. This removal results in an
overall advancement of one or more of the goals set forth
in this section that should more than offset any additional
burden caused by the incentives. These provisions are also
based on the recognition that the incentives create an
opportunity to consolidate off-premise signs that would
otherwise remain distributed throughout the community.
Spacing requirements are included in this section to
prevent drivers from viewing multiple enhanced off premise
dynamic displays at one time.
1. A person may obtain a permit for an enhanced
10.24-25
dynamic display on one face of an off-premise sign
if the following requirements are met:
a. The applicant agrees in writing to
permanently remove, within 45 days
after issuance of the permit, at least
two other faces of an outdoor
advertising sign in the city that are
owned or leased by the applicant, each
of which must satisfy the criteria of
parts (b) through (d) of this
subsection. This removal must include
the complete removal of the structure
supporting each sign face. The
applicant must agree that the city may
remove the sign if the applicant does
not timely do so, and the application
must be accompanied by a cash deposit
or letter of credit acceptable to the
city attorney sufficient to pay the
city's costs for that removal. The
applicant must also agree that it is
removing the sign voluntarily and that
it has no right to compensation for
the removed sign under any law.
b. The city has not previously issued an
enhanced dynamic display permit based
on the removal of the particular faces
relied upon in this permit
application.
c. Each removed sign has a copy and
graphic area of at least 200 square
feet
d. If the removed sign face is one for
which a state permit is required by
state law, the applicant must
surrendered its permit to the state
upon removal of the sign. The sign that
is the subject of the enhanced dynamic
display permit cannot begin to operate
until proof is provided to the city
that the state permit has been
surrendered.
10.24-26
e. The applicant must agree in writing
that no dynamic displays will ever be
used on one additional off-premise
sign that has a copy and graphic area
of at least 200 square feet in size.
This agreement will be binding on the
applicant and all future owners of the
sign. If the sign is subsequently
removed or destroyed and not replaced,
the holder of the enhanced dynamic
display permit is not required to
substitute a different sign for the
one that no longer exists.
f. No enhanced dynamic off-premise sign
shall be erected closer to any other
such off-premise sign than 2,640 feet.
g. Two or more enhanced dynamic offpremise
signs may not be used to
present a sequential message.
h. If one sign face on a double-faced offpremise
sign is approved for dynamic
signage, the remaining of the two
faces must be one of the two faces
designated for removal.
i. One of the two faces designated for
removal must be within 1,000 feet of a
road designated as an Interstate or
State Highway.
2. If the applicant complies with the permit
requirements noted above, the city will issue an
enhanced dynamic display permit for the
designated off-premise sign. This permit will
allow a dynamic display to occupy 100 percent of
the potential copy and graphic area and to change
no more frequently than once every eight seconds.
The designated sign must meet all other
requirements of this ordinance.
Subd. 15. Brightness.
A. All signs must meet the following brightness
standards:
10.24-27
1) No sign may be brighter than is necessary
for clear and adequate visibility.
2) No sign may be of such intensity or
brilliance as to impair the vision of a motor
vehicle driver with average eyesight or to
otherwise interfere with the driver's
operation of a motor vehicle.
3) No sign may be of such intensity or
brilliance that it interferes with the
effectiveness of an official traffic sign,
device or signal.
Subd. 16. Height. The following maximum sign heights
shall apply:
A. Individual signs in residential areas (except area
identification signs) -4 feet.
B. Freestanding signs north of 18th Avenue -18 feet
C. Freestanding signs between 18th Avenue and T.H. 27/34th
Avenue -24 feet
D. Signs south of T.H. 27/34th Avenue -36 feet
E. Signs within 100 feet of the Interstate 94 right-ofway;
signs within 100 feet of the Interstate 94/T.H. 27
and Interstate 94/T.H. 29 interchange right-of-way -45
feet
Subd. 17. Master Signage Plan. A master signage plan
shall be provided for any non-residential development plan, site
plan/building permit review, exterior remodel, non-residential
planned development district, exterior remodel or other official
plan for developments with more than one individual business or
tenant. No permit shall be issued for an individual sign requiring
a permit in a development where more than one business or industry
will be located until a master signage plan has been approved by
the City. The master signage plan is intended to control total
sign area and sign placement so as to help eliminate
inconsistencies as tenant/occupants change.
A. The owner/agent shall submit a master signage plan
containing the following information in additional to
10.24-28
that required under Subdivision 8 of this Ordinance:
1. A scaled site plan showing location of
buildings, parking lots, driveways and
landscaped areas and an accurate indication on
the site plan of the proposed location of
present and future signs of any type, whether
requiring a permit or not.
2. Scaled color drawings clearly showing the
location of signage on building elevation.
3. Computation of the maximum total sign area
permitted under this Ordinance, the maximum
area for individual signs and the height of
signs.
4. Specifications for color scheme, lettering or
graphic style, lighting, location of each sign
on the building, materials and sign
proportions.
B. The maximum number of signs affixed to a building by
each business within the building shall be controlled
by the master signage plan.
C. Other provisions of the plan may contain such other
restrictions as the owner of the development or
building may reasonably determine.
D. The plan shall be signed by all owners or their
authorized agents on such form as required by the
City.
E. A master signage plan may be amended by filing a new
master signage plan that conforms with all
requirements of this Ordinance.
F. After approval of a master signage plan, no sign shall
be erected, placed, painted or maintained, except in
conformance with approved master signage plan and such
plan may be enforced in the same way as provisions of
this Ordinance. In case of any conflict between the
provisions of such a plan and this Ordinance, the
Ordinance shall govern.
Subd. 18. Non-Conforming Signs. It is recognized that
signs exist which were lawful before this Sign Ordinance was
enacted, but will be prohibited under the terms of this Ordinance.
It is the intent of this Sign Ordinance that nonconforming signs
shall not be enlarged upon or expanded, nor be used as grounds for
adding other signs or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. It is further the intent of this Sign Ordinance to permit
legal nonconforming signs to continue as legal nonconforming signs
provided such signs are safe, are
10.24-29
maintained so as not to be unsightly, and have not been abandoned
or removed subject to the following provisions:
A. No sign shall be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
B. If the use of the nonconforming sign or sign
structure is discontinued for a period of one year,
the sign or sign structure shall not be
reconstructed or used except in conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
C. Should such nonconforming sign or sign structure be
damaged or structure be destroyed by any means to
an extent greater than fifty (50) percent of its
market value and all required permits for its
reconstruction have not been applied for within 180
days of when the sign or sign structure was damaged,
it shall not be reconstructed or used except in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
D. Should such sign or sign structure be moved for any
reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the
zoning district in which it is located after it is
moved.
E. No existing sign devoted to a use not permitted by
the zoning code in the zoning district in which it
is located shall be enlarged, expanded or moved
except in changing the sign to a sign permitted in
the zoning district in which is it located.
F. When a building loses its nonconforming status all
signs devoted to the structure shall be removed and
all signs painted directly on the structure shall
be repainted or recovered in a neutral color or a
color or material which will harmonize with the
structure.
Subd. 19. Administration.
A. Permits. No sign shall be erected, altered,
reconstructed, or moved in the City without first
securing a permit from the City, unless
specifically waived within this Section or
elsewhere in the Ordinance. The content of the
sign shall not be reviewed or considered in
determining whether to approve or deny a sign
permit. Application for the permit shall be in
writing addressed to the issuing authority and
10.24-30
shall contain the following information:
1. names and addresses of the owners of the
display structure and property;
2. the address at which any signs are to be
erected;
3. the names of the licensed sign hanger
erected the sign, if applicable;
4. the lot, block and addition at which the
signs are to be erected and the street on
which they are to front
5. a complete set of plans showing the
necessary elevations, distances, size and
details to fully and clearly represent the
construction and place of the signs;
6. type of sign (i.e. wall sign, pylon sign,
etc.)
7. if the proposed sign is along a state trunk
highway or interstate highway, the
application shall be accompanied by proof
that the applicant has obtained a permit
from the state for the sign.
B. Sign Hangers License. All sign hangers engaged in
the business of erecting, constructing, enlarging,
alteration, repair, moving, removing, demolition,
or equipping a sign shall be required to be licensed
annually. Fees for the sign hanger license shall
be established by the Alexandria City Council.
C. Fees. The fee for an application to the Planning
Commission and all sign permits shall be
established by the Alexandria City Council.
D. Enforcement. The Zoning Administrator is empowered
to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance as
necessary to carry out the purpose of this
Ordinance. The Administrator shall cause the
removal of any sign that endangers the public
safety such as an abandoned, dangerous, or
10.24-31
electrically or structurally defective sign or a
sign for which no permit has been issued or a sign
which obstructs or interferes with the public
right-of-way. A notice of violation shall be
mailed to the sign holder citing the violation. If
the violation is not corrected within ten (10)
days, the City shall have the authority to remove
the sign. No notice is required to be provided to
the holder of a temporary sign not meeting the
requirements of Subdivision 10 of this Section, and
the Public Works Coordinator, Chief of Police or
Zoning Administrator are hereby expressly
authorized to immediately remove and impound such
a temporary sign, the costs of which removal and
impoundment shall be charged against the owner of
the site on which the sign was displayed.

Section 10.25. Variance and Appeals.
Subd. 1. Board of Adjustment and Appeals. The City
Council shall act as a Board of Adjustments and Appeals and shall
have the following powers:
A. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
that there is an error in order, requirement, decisions, or
determination made by the administrative official in the
enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
B. To hear requests for variances from the
literal interpretations of this Ordinance in instances where their
strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration.
Subd. 2. Findings of Hardship and Fact. In
consideration of all requests for a variance, the City Council
acting as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals and the Planning
Commission in its advisory role shall make a finding of hardship
and a finding of fact. A hardship exists when:
A. The property in question cannot be put to a
reasonable use if the variance is not granted, or
B. The plight of the property owner is due to
circumstances unique to this property not created by the property
owner, or

5/8/19
10.31.01-4
facility owned or operated by a municipal electric utility and
(b) a utility pole or other facility used to supply traction
power to public transit systems, including railways, trams,
streetcars and trolley buses.
Subd. 3. Requirement to Comply. Placement,
modification, operation, relocation and removal of a small cell
facility and/or wireless support structure shall comply with
Section 10.31 of the City Code of the City of Alexandria and
Alexandria’s Design Guidelines (if any) at the time the permit
for installation, modification, relocation or removal is
approved and as amended from time to time.
Subd. 4. Location of Small Cell Facilities, Related
Ground Equipment, and Wireless Support Structures.
A. Most Preferable Locations: The following are
the most preferred areas for new small cell facilities.
1. Industrial Areas if not adjacent to a
municipal park, residential area or architectural review
district (if any).
2. Highway or Street/Public Rights of Way
areas if not adjacent to a municipal park, residential area or
architectural review district (if any).
3. Retail and Commercial Areas if not
adjacent to a municipal park, residential area or architectural
review district (if any), or within the CBD.
B. Collocation Preference
1. It is the City’s strong preference that
whenever an applicant proposes to place a new wireless support
structure with a small cell facility within 250 feet from an
existing wireless support structure, the applicant either
collocate with the existing facility or demonstrate that a
collocation is either not technically feasible or space on the
existing facility is not potentially available.
C. Least Preferable Locations
1. The following are the least preferred
areas for new small cell facilities (in declining order of
preference).
a. Residential Areas
b. Parks
c. Historic Districts
d. Architectural review district (if
any)
5/8/19
10.31.01-5
Maps showing the boundaries of the CBD and the
Architectural review district(s) (if any) are available on the
City’s website.
D. Order of Preference for Wireless Support
Structures: The following list indicates the order of preference
for wireless support structures for small cell facilities.
Images of the Municipal Service Poles are attached in Exhibit A.
1. Existing Light Poles: It is the City’s
preference that small cell facilities be installed on existing
non-ornamental municipal street light poles (not electric or
telephone utility poles).
2. Non-Ornamental Traffic Signal
Structures/Poles: If the applicant does not have the right to
use existing non-ornamental light poles or lines under
reasonable terms and conditions or the utilization imposes
technical limits, the City prefers that the applicant next look
to or traffic signal structures.
3. New Poles: If the first two items have
proven to be unavailable, the City prefers the installation of a
new pole to serve as a wireless support structure.
4. Ornamental Municipal Service Poles: The
use of ornamental municipal street lights and traffic signals as
wireless support structures is discouraged. These should only be
proposed if the three items listed above are unavailable or when
requested by the City based on the proposed location. Use of
ornamental traffic signal mast arms is preferred over use of
ornamental street lights.
5. Sign Poles (15 feet or taller): The
only sign poles that may be considered are those that are at
least fifteen (15) feet tall. These are the least preferred
option for a wireless support structure.
Subd. 5. Consideration of Alternate Locations.
The City reserves the right to propose an alternate
wireless support structure to the one proposed in the
application. The City may also propose an alternate location for
a new wireless support structure within one hundred feet of the
proposed location or within a distance that is equivalent to the
width of the right of way in or on which the new wireless
support structure is proposed, whichever is greater. The
operator shall use if it has the right to use the alternate
5/8/19
10.31.01-6
location on reasonable terms and conditions and the alternate
location does not impose technical limits or additional costs.
Subd. 6. Guidelines on Placement. Generally, an
applicant shall construct and maintain small cell facilities and
wireless support structures in a manner that does not (1)
obstruct, impede or hinder the usual travel or public safety on
a right of way; (2) obstruct the legal use of a right of way by
other utility providers; (3) violate nondiscriminatory
applicable codes; (4) violate or conflict with Section 10.31 of
the City Code or these design guidelines; and (5) violate the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
The City desires to promote cleanly organized and
streamlined facilities using the smallest and least intrusive
means available to provide wireless services to the community.
Generally, a small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure shall match and be consistent with the materials and
finish of the adjacent municipal poles of the surrounding area
adjacent to their location. In the absence of adjacent municipal
poles, the wireless support structure shall match the materials
and finish of the adjacent utility poles.
A. Antennas on Existing or Replaced Light
Poles:
The antenna(s) associated with collocation
on existing or replaced light poles must have concealed cable
connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The maximum
dimensions for antennas shall not be more than six (6) cubic
feet in volume, including any enclosure for the antenna.
B. Right of Way:
Small cell facilities and wireless support
structures and related equipment shall be placed, as much as
possible, in line with other utility features and in a location
that minimizes any obstruction, impediment or hindrance to the
usual travel or public safety on a right of way.
C. Height Above Ground:
1. Small Cell Facilities: Small cell
facilities shall be installed at least fifteen (15) feet above
the ground.
5/8/19
10.31.01-7
2. New wireless support structures:
In areas where there are no wireless support structures or light
poles taller than thirty (30) feet in height above ground level
and the maximum allowable height for building construction in
the underlying zoning district is thirty (30) feet in height
above ground level or less, the overall height of a new wireless
support structure and any collocated antennas shall not be more
than thirty (30) feet in height above ground level. In all other
areas, the overall height of a new wireless support structure
and any collocated antennas shall not be more than fifty (50)
feet in height above ground level.
3. Existing wireless support
structures: For an existing wireless support structure, the
antenna and any associated shroud or concealment material are
permitted to be collocated at the top of the existing wireless
support structure and shall not increase the height of the
existing wireless support structure by more than five (5) feet.
4. Relationship to light fixture:
All small cell facilities shall be installed at an elevation on
a pole/structure higher than the light fixture occupying the
same pole, unless the light fixture is at the top of the
pole/structure, in which case no small cell facility may be
installed on that pole/structure.
D. Protrusion: No protrusions from the
outer circumference of the existing structure or pole shall be
more than two (2) feet. The pole and all attachments to the pole
that are projecting, or any equipment or appurtenance mounted on
the ground, shall comply with Americans with Disabilities Act
and shall not obstruct an existing or planned sidewalk or
walkway. The City, at its option, may waive the requirement to
limit the protrusion to no more than two (2) feet.
E. Location of Equipment: General Small
cell facilities and related equipment shall not impede
pedestrian or vehicular traffic in the right of way. If any
small cell facility or wireless support structure is installed
in a location that is not in accordance with the plans approved
by the City, impedes pedestrian or vehicular traffic and/or or
does not comply or otherwise renders the right of way noncompliant
with applicable laws, including the Americans with
Disabilities Act, then the operator shall promptly remove the
small cell facilities and/or wireless support structure. If the
operator does not complete removal in a reasonable timeframe,
the City will remove it and bill the operator for the cost of
5/8/19
10.31.01-8
the removal. The applicant is required to incorporate ambient
noise suppression measures and/or required to place the
equipment in locations less likely to impact adjacent residences
or businesses to ensure compliance with all applicable noise
regulations.
Utility Lines: Service lines must be undergrounded whenever
feasible to avoid additional overhead lines. For metal poles,
undergrounded cables and wires must transition directly into the
pole base without any external junction box.
Spools and Coils: To reduce clutter and deter vandalism, excess
fiber optic or coaxial cables for small cell facilities shall
not be spooled, coiled or otherwise stored on the pole except
within the approved enclosure such as a cage or cabinet.
Above-Ground Conduit: On wood poles, all above-ground wires,
cables and connections shall be encased in the smallest section
or smallest diameter PVC channel, conduit, u-guard, or shroud
feasible, with a maximum dimension of 4” diameter. Such conduit
shall be finished in zinc, aluminum or stainless steel, or
colored to match those metal finishes.
F. Location of Ground Mounted Equipment:
Ground equipment should be minimal and the least intrusive. It
should be placed to minimize any obstruction, impediment, or
hindrance to the usual travel or public safety on a right of
way, maximize the line of sight required to add to safe travel
of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and maximize that line of
sight at street corners and intersections and minimize hazards
at those locations. The City may deny a request that negatively
impacts vehicular and/or pedestrian safety. The equipment shroud
or cabinet must contain all the equipment associated with the
facility other than the antenna. All cables and conduits
associated with the equipment must be concealed from view,
routed directly through the metal pole (with the exception of
wood power poles) and undergrounded between the pole and the
ground-mounted cabinet.
G. Location of Pole Mounted Equipment: All
pole-mounted equipment must be installed as flush to the pole as
possible. Equipment attached to metal poles must be installed
using stainless steel banding straps. Equipment attached to wood
poles may be bolted to the pole or installed using stainless
steel banding straps. When the straps are attached to a metal
pole, they must match the color of the pole. Through-bolting or
use of lag bolts is prohibited. All pole mounted equipment shall
be located as close together as technically possible and if
possible, on the same side of the pole. When pole-mounted
5/8/19
10.31.01-9
equipment is either permitted or required, all equipment other
than the antenna(s), electric meter and disconnect switch must
be concealed within an equipment cage. Equipment cabinet may not
extend more than 24 inches from the face of the pole. The
equipment cabinet must be non-reflective, colored to match the
existing pole if attached to a metal pole, and in the color of
brushed aluminum if attached to a wood pole. Equipment cabinets
should be mounted as flush to the pole as possible. Any standoff
mount for the equipment cabinet may not exceed four (4) inches.
Electric Meter: The City strongly encourages site operators to
use flat-rate electric service when it would eliminate the need
for a meter. When a meter is necessary, site operators shall use
the smallest and least intrusive electric meter available.
Whenever permitted by the electric service provider, the
electric meter base should be painted to match the pole.
Telephone/Fiber Optic Utilities: Cabinets for telephone and/or
fiber optic utilities may not extend more than 24 inches from
the face of the pole, and must be painted, wrapped or otherwise
colored to match the pole. Microwave or other wireless backhaul
is discouraged when it would involve a separate and unconcealed
antenna.
H. Undergrounded Equipment Vaults:
Equipment in an environmentally controlled underground vault may
be required in some areas where technologically feasible and
appropriate for the location.
I. New Wireless Support Structures:
Spacing: The City strongly discourages more than one (1) new
wireless support structure per block and will not approve more
than one per 250 feet on each side of the street to minimize the
hazard of poles adjacent to roadways and minimize visual clutter
and distractions to vehicular traffic. An exemption may be
granted if the applicant can demonstrate that this restriction
has the effect of preventing wireless service to this location.
Wireless support structures shall be spaced apart from utility
poles or wireless support structures supporting small cell
facilities at the same spacing between utility poles in the
immediate proximity. If multiple requests are received to
install two or more poles that would violate the spacing
requirement or to collocate two or more small cell facilities on
the same wireless support structure, priority will be given to
the first request received that meets these guidelines.
Alignment with Other Poles: The centerline of any new wireless
support structure must be aligned, as much as possible, with the
centerlines of existing poles on the same street segment, but
5/8/19
10.31.01-10
only if the new structure’s height does not conflict with
overhead power utility lines and facilities.
General Restrictions on New Wood Poles: In all locations, the
City reserves the right to require a metal pole rather than a
wood pole based on the build and/or natural environmental
character of the proposed site location. The City will not
approve any new wood poles in the architectural review district
(if any).
Wood Pole Footings and Foundations: All new wood poles must be
direct buried to a depth determined, stamped, sealed and signed
by a professional engineer licensed and registered by the State
of Minnesota, and subject to the City’s review and approval.
Metal Pole Footings and Foundations: All new metal poles must be
supported with a reinforced concrete pier. The design including
the pier, footings and anchor bolts shall be stamped, sealed and
signed by a professional engineer licensed and registered by the
State of Minnesota, and subject to the City’s review and
approval. All anchor bolts must be concealed from public view
with an appropriate pole boot or cover subject to the City’s
prior approval.
Metal Pole Material: All metal poles must be constructed from
hot-dip galvanized steel or other corrosion-resistant materials
approved by the City and finished in accordance with these
guidelines to avoid rust stains on adjacent sidewalks, buildings
or other improvements.
Metal Pole Finish: Metal poles must be painted black. The
applicant may select a paint or powder coat system in compliance
with ATSM standards.
Lighting, Planters, Flags, Banners: The City may require the
applicant to install functional streetlights and/or brackets to
hold hanging flower planters, flags and/or banners when
technically feasible and the City determines that such additions
will enhance the overall appearance and usefulness of the
proposed facility. The City may install hanging flower planters,
flags and/or banners utilizing the brackets.
J. City-Owned Wireless Support Structures
Required Load Analysis: Installations on all City-owned poles
shall have an industry standard pole load analysis completed,
sealed and signed by a Professional Engineer licensed and
registered by the State of Minnesota and submitted to the City
with each permit application indicating that the City-owned pole
to which the small cell facility will to be attached will safely
support the load.
Height of Attachments: All attachments on all City-owned poles
shall be at least fifteen (15) feet above grade.
5/8/19
10.31.01-11
Power Source: A small cell facility on a City-owned wireless
support structure may not use the same power source that
provides power for the original purpose of the wireless support
structure.
Installations on Traffic Signals and Street Lights:
Installations on all traffic signal structures or street lights
must not interfere with the integrity of the facility in any way
that may compromise the safety of the public. The installation
must not interfere with other existing uses on the pole such as
traffic signals, street lights, hanging flower planters, flags,
and/or banners. Installation of small cell facilities on any
traffic signal structure or street light shall (a) be encased in
a separate conduit than the traffic light electronics; (b) have
a separate electric power connection than the traffic
signal/street light structure; and (c) have a separate access
point than the traffic signal/street light structure.
Installations on Sign Poles (15 feet or taller): Installations
on sign poles may only occur if the sign pole is fifteen (15)
feet or taller.
Reservation of space for future public safety or transportation
uses: An application for space on a City owned or operated
wireless support structure that conflicts with space reserved
for future public safety or transportation uses documented in an
approved plan in place at the time of the application will be
denied unless the operator pays for the replacement of the pole
or wireless support structure and the replaced pole or wireless
support structure will accommodate the future use and the small
cell facility.
Subd. 7. Undergrounding Requirements. The City may
deny requests to install structures and facilities in the right
of way in an area where the City has required all structures and
facilities except those owned by the City to be placed
underground or elsewhere in the right of way or a utility
easement. These areas are easily identifiable as those locations
where electric has been placed underground; however, if an
applicant is uncertain as to whether such facilities have been
placed underground in the area, the applicant should contact the
City for clarification before applying for or installing any
wireless support structures and/or small cell facilities in the
area. The applicant may request a waiver if the operator is
unable to achieve its service objective using a location in the
right of way where the prohibition does not apply, in a utility
easement the operator has the right to access, or in or on other
suitable locations or structures made available by the City at
reasonable rates, fees and terms.
5/8/19
10.31.01-12
Subd. 8. General Aesthetic Requirements.
A. Concealment: New Wireless Support
Structures: It is the City’s preference that all new wireless
support structures be camouflaged, except for those located in
an area that is predominantly industrial. The applicant shall
submit their proposal for camouflage with the permit
application.
Small Cell Facilities: Small cell facilities shall be concealed
or enclosed as much as possible in an equipment box, cabinet, or
other unit that may include ventilation openings. Unless
approved by the City in writing, there shall be no external
cables and wires hanging off a pole. The approved ones shall be
sheathed or enclosed in a conduit, so that wires are protected
and not visible or visually minimized to the extent possible.
Equipment Enclosures: Equipment enclosures, including electric
meters, shall be as small as possible. Ground-mounted equipment
shall incorporate concealment elements into the proposed design.
Concealment may include, but shall not be limited to,
landscaping, strategic placement in less obtrusive locations and
placement within existing or replacement street furniture.
Landscaping: Landscape screening shall be provided and
maintained around ground mounted equipment enclosures. The
planting quantity and size should be such that 100% screening is
achieved within two years of installation. The City may grant an
exemption from this landscaping requirement based on the
characteristics of the specific location for the equipment
enclosure. Tree “topping” or the improper pruning of trees is
prohibited. Any proposed pruning or removal of trees, shrubs or
other landscaping already existing in the right of way must be
noted in the application and must be approved by the City.
When underground vaults are proposed, they shall be located to
minimize disruption to the placement of street trees. Adequate
planting depth shall be provided between the top of the vault
and the finished grade to allow plants to grow in a healthy
condition.
B. Allowed Colors: All colors shall match the
background of any wireless support structure upon which the
facilities are located. In the case of existing wood poles,
finishes of conduit shall be zinc, aluminum or stainless steel,
or colored to match those metal finishes and equipment cabinets
shall be the color of brushed aluminum. Ground mounted equipment
cabinets shall be the color of brushed aluminum.
C. Signage/Lights/Logos/Decals/Cooling Fans
Signage: Operator shall post its name, location identifying
5/8/19
10.31.01-13
information, and emergency telephone number in an area on the
cabinet of the small cell facility that is visible to the
public. Signage required under this section shall not exceed 4”
x 6”, unless otherwise required by law (e.g. RF ground
notification signs) or the City. If no cabinet exists, the
signage shall be placed at the base of the pole.
Lights: New small cell facilities and wireless support
structures shall not be illuminated, except in accord with state
or federal regulations, or unless illumination is integral to
the camouflaging strategy such as design intended to look like a
street light pole.
Logos/Decals: Remove or paint over unnecessary equipment
manufacturer decals. New small cell facilities and wireless
support structures shall not include advertisements and may only
display information required by a federal, state or local
agency. Utilize the smallest and lowest visibility radiofrequency
(RF) warning sticker required by government or
electric utility regulations. Place the RF sticker as close to
the antenna as possible.
Cooling Fans: In residential areas, use a passive cooling
system. In the event that a fan is needed, use a cooling fan
with a low noise profile.
Subd. 9. Specific Area Aesthetic Requirements.
A. Old Alexandria Commercial Area (CBD): As
noted in Subd.4, the City’s preference for wireless support
structures is existing non-ornamental light poles. The next
preference is for Non-Ornamental Traffic Signal
Structures/Poles. This does not apply in Old Alexandria
Commercial Area. Location of small cell wireless facilities
within Old Alexandria Commercial Area shall not be within twohundred
(200) feet of the centerline of Broadway Street/TH 29.
In order to meet the service needs of operators, the City will
consider requests to locate small cell facilities on other
municipal property in this area, such as municipal parking lots,
to limit additional congestion in the Broadway/TH29 right of
way.
If existing light poles/structures are not available for
collocation, operators may propose a new wireless support
structure. New wireless support structures that will be more
than twenty (20) feet in height shall match the design of the
City’s black traffic signal mast arms. New wireless support
structures that will be twenty (20) feet or less in height shall
match the City’s ornamental streetlights in the CBD. Information
on the manufacturer and model identification, and detailed
5/8/19
10.31.01-14
drawings of these support structures are available from ALP
Utilities
1. New Wireless Support Structures
Outside of Old Alexandria Commercial Area: Given the congestion
of the right of way along 50th Avenue between TH 29 and Pioneer
Road and the lack of above ground facilities, careful analysis
must be given to small cell facilities proposed to be located
along 50th Avenue in this area. Operators may need to seek to
obtain easements from the owners of adjacent properties. In
order to meet the service needs of operators, the City will also
consider requests to locate small cell facilities on other
municipal property in this area, such as municipal parking lots,
to limit additional congestion in the 50th Avenue right of way.
B. Historic Residential District – Cedar and
Douglas from Sixth Avenue to Twelfth Avenue, and the Noonan
Residential Development – Lake and Maple from Sixth Avenue to
Tenth Avenue: No collocation is allowed on existing light
poles/structures, and any new wireless support structures shall
match the City’s ornamental light poles. Information on the
manufacturer and model identification, and detailed drawings of
these support structures are available from the ALP Utilities.
C. Residential Areas: In residential areas, new
wireless support structures should be located to avoid
obstructing the view of building facades by placing the wireless
support structure at a corner, intersection or along a lot line.
New wireless support structures should be located in the yard
location where other overhead utilities are located unless it is
not technically feasible to do so. Applicants shall clearly
explain the rationale for requests that deviate from this
expectation.
D. Third Avenue/TH 29 (north of Fourth Avenue
to CSAH #42: Serving as a minor arterial and carrying
significant traffic loads, this right of way is largely
congested. Location within two-hundred (200) feet of the
centerline of Third Avenue/TH 29 is strongly discouraged. In
order to meet the service needs of operators, the City will
consider requests to locate small cell facilities on other
municipal property in this area, such as municipal parking lots.
Subd. 10. General Provisions.
A. Tree Maintenance: Operator, its contractors,
and agents shall obtain written permission from the City before
5/8/19
10.31.01-15
trimming trees in the right of way hanging over its small cell
facility and/or wireless support structure to prevent branches
of such trees from contacting attached small cell facility. When
trimming such trees on private property, the operator, its
contractors, and agents shall notify the City and obtain written
permission from the property owner. When directed by the City,
operator shall trim under the supervision and direction of the
City. The City shall not be liable for any damages, injuries, or
claims arising from operator’s actions under this section.
B. Graffiti Abatement: As soon as practical,
but not later than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date
operator receives notice thereof, operator shall remove all
graffiti on any of its small cell facilities and/or wireless
support structures located in the right of way. The City may
agree to an extension of time for abatement when necessitated by
the need to order replacement equipment when such equipment is
ordered in a timely manner.
C. Minor Technical Exceptions: The City
recognizes that in some circumstances strict compliance with
these guidelines may result in undesirable aesthetic outcomes
and that minor deviations should be granted when the need for
such deviation arises from circumstances outside the applicant’s
control.
D. Waivers if requirements have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of wireless service to a location: In
the event that any applicant asserts that strict compliance with
any provision in these guidelines, as applied to a specific
proposed small cell facility, would effectively prohibit the
provision of personal wireless services, the City may grant a
limited, one-time exemption from strict compliance.
E. Permitting: Application for permits for the
necessary installation of small cell wireless structures,
antennae, etc. within the public right of way or on other
municipal property shall be made to ALP Utilities at its offices
located at 316 Fillmore Street. ALP Utilities shall establish
the necessary fees, leases, and/or other requirements for such
permitting, and shall provide the necessary forms for making
such application.

Section 10.32. Erosion and Sediment Control
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is
to control or eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation within the
City. This article establishes standards and specifications for
conservation practices and planning activities that minimize soil
erosion and sedimentation.
Subd. 2. Scope and Application. Except as
exempted by the definition of the term “land disturbance activity”
in Subdivision 3, any person, state agency, or political
subdivision thereof proposing land disturbance activity within the
city shall apply to the city for the approval of the erosion and
sediment control plan. No land shall be disturbed until the plan
is approved by the city and conforms to the standards set forth in
this article.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. Where
the requirements imposed by any provision of this article are
either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable
conditions imposed by any other city ordinance, law, code, statute,
or regulation, the regulations that are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or requirements shall prevail. Application of
this article should be considered in conjunction with other
controls regulating land use and waters within the city, including
administration of Wetland Conservation Act regulations,
administered by the city through its agent, the Douglas County
Soil & Water Conservation District (SWCD).
Subd. 3. Definitions. Unless specifically defined
below, words or phrases used in this Section shall be interpreted
so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage
and to give this Chapter its most reasonable application. For the
purpose of this Chapter, the words “must” and “shall” are mandatory
and not permissive. All distances, unless otherwise specified,
shall be measured horizontally.
1. Best Management Practices (BMPs). Erosion and
sediment control practices that are the most effective and
practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing the
degradation of surface water, including construction-phasing,
minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed,
prohibitions, and other management practices published by the
state.
10.32-2
2. Common Plan of Development or Sale. A contiguous
area where multiple separate and distinct land disturbing
activities may be taking place at different times, or on different
schedules, but under one proposed plan. This item is broadly
defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or
physical demarcation indicating that land disturbing activities
may occur.
3. Developer. Any person, group, firm, corporation,
sole proprietorship, partnership, state agency, or political
subdivision thereof engaged in a land disturbance activity.
4. Development. Any land disturbance activity that
changes the site’s runoff characteristics in conjunction with
residential, commercial, industrial or institutional construction
or alteration.
5. Erosion. Any process that wears away the surface
of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or gravity.
6. Erosion Control. Refers to methods employed to
prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization practices,
horizontal slope grading, temporary or permanent cover, and
construction phasing.
7. Erosion and Sediment Practice Specifications or
Practice. The management procedures, techniques, and methods to
control soil erosion and sedimentation as officially adopted by
either the state, county, City or local watershed group, whichever
is more stringent.
8. Exposed Soil Areas. All areas of the construction
site where the vegetation (trees, shrubs, brush, grasses, etc.)
or impervious surface has been removed, thus rendering the soil
more prone to erosion. This includes topsoil stockpile areas,
borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site.
9. Final Stabilization. Means that all soil disturbing
activities at the site have been completed, and that a uniform
(evenly distributed, e.g., without large bare areas) perennial
vegetative cover with a density of seventy (70) percent of the
cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent
structures has been established, or equivalent permanent
stabilization measures have been employed.
10. Land Disturbance Activity. Any land change that
may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of
sediments into or upon waters or lands within this government’s
jurisdiction, including construction, clearing & grubbing,
grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. Within the
context of this rule, land disturbance activity does not mean:
10.32-3
a. Minor land disturbance activities such as home
gardens and an individual’s home landscaping, repairs, and
maintenance work, unless such activity exceeds one half acre in
exposed soil.
b. Additions or modifications to existing single family
structures which
result in creating under one half acre of exposed soil or
impervious surface and/or is part of a larger common development
plan.
c. Construction, installation, and maintenance of
fences, signs, posts, poles, and electric, telephone, cable
television, utility lines or individual service connections to
these utilities, which result in creating under one half acre of
exposed soil or impervious surface.
d. Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural,
horticultural, or silvicultural (forestry) crops.
e. Emergency work to protect life, or property and
emergency repairs, unless the land disturbing activity would have
otherwise required an approved erosion and sediment control plan,
except for the emergency. If such a plan would have been required,
then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and stabilized in
accordance with the City’s requirements as soon as possible.
11. Permanent Cover. Means “final stabilization.”
Examples include grass, gravel, asphalt, and concrete. See also
the definition of “final stabilization.”
12. Phased Project or Development. Clearing a parcel
of land in distinct phases, with at least fifty percent (50%) of
the project’s preceding phase meeting the definition of “final
stabilization” and the remainder proceeding toward completion,
before beginning the next phase of clearing.
13. Sediment. The product of an erosion process; solid
material both mineral and organic, that is in suspension, is being
transported, or has been moved by water, wind, or ice, and has
come to rest on the earth's surface either above or below water
level.
14. Sedimentation. The process or action of depositing
sediment.
15. Sediment Control. The methods employed to prevent
sediment from leaving the development site. Examples of sediment
control practices are silt fences, sediment traps, earth dikes,
drainage swales, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains,
storm drain inlet protection, and temporary or permanent
sedimentation basins.
16. Soil. The unconsolidated mineral and organic
material on the immediate surface of the earth. For the purposes
10.32-4
of this document temporary stockpiles of clean sand, gravel,
aggregate, concrete or bituminous materials (which have less
stringent protection) are not considered “soil” stockpiles.
17. Stabilized. The exposed ground surface after it
has been covered by sod, erosion control blanket, riprap, pavement
or other material that prevents erosion. Simply sowing grass seed
is not considered stabilization.
18. Steep Slope. Any slope steeper than twelve (12)
percent (Twelve (12) feet of rise for every one hundred (100) feet
horizontal run).
19. Temporary Protection. Short-term methods employed
to prevent erosion. Examples of such protection are straw, mulch,
erosion control blankets, wood chips, and erosion netting.

party or parties listed on the application and/or the plan as
contacts. Except during an emergency action, forty-eight (48)
hours after notification by the City or seventy-two (72) hours
after the failure of erosion control measures, whichever is less,
the City at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such
notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written
notification should follow as quickly as practical. If after making
a good faith effort to notify the responsible party or parties,
the City has been unable to establish contact, the City may proceed
10.32-8
with corrective work. There are conditions when time is of the
essence in controlling erosion. During such a condition the City
may take immediate action, and then notify the applicant as soon
as possible
2. Erosion off-site. If sediment breaches the perimeter
of the site, the applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and
restoration plan, obtain the right-of entry from the adjoining
property owner, and implement the cleanup and restoration plan
within forty-eight (48) hours of obtaining the adjoining property
owner’s permission. In no case, unless written approval is received
from the City, may more than seven (7) calendar days go by without
corrective action being taken. If in the discretion of the City,
the permit holder does not repair the damage caused by the erosion,
the city may do the remedial work required. When restoration to
wetlands and other resources are required, the applicant shall be
required to work with the appropriate agency to ensure that the
work is done properly.
3. Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If
eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction
activities) enters streets, wetlands, or other water bodies,
cleanup and repair shall be immediate. The applicant shall provide
all traffic control and flagging required to protect the traveling
public during the cleanup operations.
4. Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails
to conform to any provision of this policy within the time
stipulated, the City may take the following actions.
a. Issue a stop work order, withhold the
scheduling of inspections, and/or
the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy
b. Revoke any permit issued by the City to the
applicant for the site
in question or any other of the applicant’s sites within the City’s
jurisdiction.
c. Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor to
correct the deficiency. The
issuance of a permit constitutes a right-of-entry for the City or
its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose
of correcting deficiencies in erosion control.
d. Require reimbursement to the City for all
costs incurred in correcting stormwater pollution control
deficiencies. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days after
the City incurs costs, the City will halt all work on the project
site and assess any reimbursement costs to the property. As a

be notified in writing of the reason for such action and what
requirements shall be necessary to meet the approval of the
Commission.
B. Approval of the City Council. After review of
the final plat by the Planning Commission, such final plat,

11-11
be submitted to the City Council for approval. If accepted, the
final plat shall be approved by simple action, which action shall
provide for the acceptance of all agreements for basic
improvements, public dedication and other requirements as
indicated by the City Council. If disapproved, the grounds for
any refusal to approve a plat shall be set forth in the
proceedings of the Council and reported to the person or persons
applying for such approval.

Section 11.05. Design Standards
Subd. 1. Blocks.
A. Block Length. In general, intersecting
streets, determining block lengths, shall be provided at such
intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet
existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in
residential subdivisions shall normally not exceed thirteen
hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length, except where topography or
other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks
longer than eight hundred (800) feet, pedestrial ways and/or
easements through the block may be required near the center of the
block. Blocks for business or industrial use should normally not
exceed thirteen hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length.
B. Block Width. The width of the block shall
normally be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots of
appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use
shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their
respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking
and deliveries.
12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-3
Subd. 2. Lots.
A. The minimum lot area, width and depth shall
not be less than that established by the Zoning Ordinance in
effect at the time of adoption of the final plat.
B. Corner lots for residential use shall have
additional width to permit appropriate building setback from both
streets as required in the Zoning Ordinance.
C. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at
right angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines.
D. Every lot must have the minimum frontage as
required in the Zoning Ordinance on a City approved street other
11-18
than an alley.
E. Setback or building lines shall be shown on
all lots intended for residential use and shall not be less than
the setback required by the Alexandria Zoning Ordinance. On those
lots which are intended for business use, the setback shall be at
least that required by the Alexandria Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 3. Streets and Alleys.
A. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets normally shall
connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent
subdivisions, or provide future connections to adjoining
unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of
streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of
thoroughfares and collector streets shall be considered in their
relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic
conditions, to run-off of storm water, to public convenience and
safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of
the area to be served.
B. Minor streets should be so planned as to
discourage their use by non-local traffic. Dead end streets are
prohibited, but cul-de-sacs will be permitted only where
topography or other conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sacs
shall normally not be longer than five hundred (500) feet,
including a terminal turn-around which shall be provided at the
closed end, with an outside curb radius of at least fifty (50)
feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than sixty (60) feet.
C. Where the plat to be submitted includes only
part of the tract owned or intended for development by the
subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system
for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by
the subdivider.
12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-19
D. When a tract is subdivided into larger than
normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so
arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future
streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate
utility connections for such resubdivision.
E. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid
out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles,
except where topography or other conditions justify variations.
Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of intersection of
streets shall be eighty (80) degrees. Street intersection jogs
with an offset of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet measured
from center line to center line, shall be avoided.
F. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or
is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or State Highway or
11-19
thoroughfare, provision may be made for a marginal access street
approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such rightof-
way, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate
use of land between such street and right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for approach connections to future grade separations, or
for lot depths.
G. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and
industrial districts, except that this requirement may be waived
where other definite and assured provision is made for service
access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking
consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Except where
justified by special conditions, such as the continuation of an
existing alley in the same block, alleys will not be approved in
residential districts. Alleys, where provided, shall not be less
than thirty (30) feet wide in commercial or industrial zoning
districts nor less than twenty (20) feet wide in residential
zoning districts. Deadend alleys shall be avoided wherever
possible, but if unavoidable, such deadend alleys may be approved
if adequate turn-around facilities are provided at the closed end.
H. Dedication of half streets will not be
approved, except where it is essential to the reasonable
development of the subdivision and in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, where it is found that it will
be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to
acquire the remaining half by condemnation so that it may be
improved in the public interest.
I. For all public ways hereafter dedicated and/or
accepted, the minimum right-of-way and paved width for street,
thoroughfares, alleys or pedestrian ways included in any
12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-20
subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each
classification as recommended by the appropriate utility companies
and/or the City Engineer, and as accepted and approved by the
Alexandria City Council.
J. Street Grades. Except when, upon the
recommendation of the City Engineer that the topography warrants a
greater maximum, the grades in all streets, thoroughfares,
collector streets, minor streets, and alleys in any subdivision
shall not be greater than eight (8) percent. In addition, there
shall be a minimum grade on all streets and thoroughfares of not
less than .36 percent.

established in adjoining properties. These easements, when
approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval of
the City Council, by Ordinance, after a recommendation from the
Planning Commission.
C. Additional easements for pole guys should be
provided at the outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall
be arranged to bisect the exterior angle sot that pole guys will

11-21
be coordinated with the different stages of construction.
Appropriate control measures shall be installed prior to
development when necessary to control erosion.
C. Land shall be developed in increments of
workable size such that adequate erosion and siltation controls
can be provided as construction progresses. The smallest
practical area of land shall be exposed at any one period of time.
D. When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be
for the shortest feasible period of time.
E. Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient to
arable soil shall be set aside for respreading over the developed
area. The soil shall be restored to a depth of four (4) inches
and shall be of a quality of ate least equal to the soil quality

grade.
12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-22
Steep slopes may be deeded to the City or an officially
recognized Homeowners Association. Upon City Council approval,
deeding of steep slopes may be used to satisfy public land
dedication requirements as established in Section 11.06.
Subd. 8. Subdivision in "W" Wetland, "S" Shoreland and
"FP" Flood Plain Management Districts.
A. No land shall be subdivided which is held
unsuitable by the City for the proposed uses because of flooding,
inadequate drainage, soil and rock formations with severe
limitations for development, severe erosion potential, unfavorable
topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment
capabilities, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the
health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the community.

Subd. 2. Conditions for Contribution of Dedication. It
shall be deemed to be in the public interest to require land
dedication, cash contribution, or any combination thereof when the
City Council, after review and recommendation, makes one or more
of the following findings of fact:
1. All or part of the proposed subdivision has
11-23
been designated as park, playground, public open space, storm
sewer holding areas or ponds.
2. Such contribution is necessary in order to
protect adjacent land uses from potential conflicting land uses
which could exist on the land to be subdivided.
3. The increased number of residents to reside
or be employed within the subdivision will increase the
recreational demands upon the City.
4. Such contribution is necessary to provide
surface water run-off generated by the uses proposed within the
subdivision.
5. The land proposed to be subdivided contains or
borders upon existing unique topographical features including but
not limited to ponds, lakes, streams, timber stands, water holding
areas, hills, steep slopes, drainage areas or bluffs which should

12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-24
Council shall require the subdivider to dedicate a percentage of
the final plat buildable land or contribute an equivalent amount
of cash, or any combination thereof to be used for either park,
open space, trail or water ponding purposes. Land dedication will
only be accepted if such property is consistent with the City's
recreation, drainage or other related plans. In the absence of
such plans or if the proposed dedicated land is inconsistent with
the appropriate City plans, cash contribution shall be mandatory.

Subd. 4. Procedure for Cash Contribution. Any cash
contribution shall be based upon ten percent (10%) of the
estimated fair market value of the undeveloped land of the final
plat area. For purposes of this subsection, "fair market value of
undeveloped land" is defined as the fair market value of the
undeveloped portion of the proposed buildable land at the time of
final plat submittal. Such value shall exclude any value to be
added to such land as a result of improvements required as part of
the final plat approval including utilities, streets, holding
ponds, and other public improvements serving such land. The fair
market value as determined by the City Council shall be based upon
a current appraisal submitted to the City by a qualified real
estate appraiser at a fair market value. The cost of the
appraisal shall be originally paid by the City and then paid to
the City from the cash contribution amount paid by the subdivider.
12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-25
If the subdivider disputes the accepted appraisal, the subdivider
at his/her own expenses may obtain a second appraisal of the
property which may, at the option of the City Council, be accepted
by the City as being an accurate appraisal of the property. If
the City rejects the subdivider's second appraisal, the amount of
the cash contribution shall be settled by arbitration between the
subdivider and the City Administrator. All moneys collected from
cash contributions shall be placed in a special fund from which
only those public uses outlined in Section 11.06, Subd. 1 of this
Ordinance may be realized.

Subd. 5. Land Dedication. In such cases where the
subdivider is required to dedicate land area, the City Council
shall have the right to determine the geographic location and
configuration of said dedication.
Subd. 6. Delayed Dedication or Contribution. Upon
petition by the subdivider on or before the time of final plat
approval, the City Council may approve a delay in the actual
11-25
dedication of the park area or the payment of the cash required in
lieu of land until such time as development occurs on the property
being platted, provided that a property legal agreement is
executed guaranteeing such dedication. Such agreement shall
provided, but shall not be limited to, the minimum area of park
land to be dedicated, identification of the location within which
the park land shall be located, that the subdivider and owner
shall not make any conveyance of any of the property identified
for park dedication until said park dedication is completed, shall
set a date after which the City shall have the right to make the
dedication of a specific area for park purposes if not done by the
subdivider, and such other terms as may be deemed necessary by the
City Council. Delayed dedication payments shall include interest
at eight percent (8%) per annum from the date of the final plat
approval to the date the payment is made to the City of
Alexandria.
Subd. 7. Exception for Outlots. In subdivisions which
include outlots, the subdivider may contribute land, cash, or any
combination thereof as provided in Section 11.06 of this Ordinance
for the entire subdivision, including the land within the outlots,
or for only that land exclusive of the outlots. When such outlots
are subdivided, the contribution requirement shall be met in
accordance with then existing regulations as applicable, unless
such contribution have been previously met.

parcel of land which previously has been subdivided and previously
subjected to a cash contribution of land dedication pursuant to
Section 11.06 of this Ordinance, the amount of such land
dedication or cash contribution previously received or dedicated
shall be a credit against any new contributions or dedication
required for resubdivision. For resubdivisions where the new
subdivision will result in a net increase in the number of
residential units, a cash contribution of $500 per increased
residential unit will be required.

improvements.
Subd. 2. General.
A. Before a final plat is approved by the City
Council, the owner or subdivider of the land covered by the said
plat shall execute and submit to the Council an agreement, which
shall be binding on his or their heirs, personal representatives
and assigns, that he will cause no private construction to be made
on said plat or file or cause to be filed any application for
building permits for such construction until all improvements
required under this Ordinance have been made or arranged for in
the manner following as respects the streets to which the lots
sought to be constructed have access.
B. Prior to the making of such required
improvements, the Council may require the owner or subdivider to
deposit with the City Clerk an amount one and one-half times (1½)
the City's estimate cost of such improvements, either in cash or
an indemnity bond, with sureties satisfactorily to the City,
conditioned upon the payment of all construction costs incurred in

engineering and legal fees and other expense in connection with
the making of such improvements.
C. No final plat shall be approved by the City
Council without first receiving a report from the City Engineer
certifying that the improvements described herein, together with
the agreements and documents required herein, meet the minimum
requirements of all applicable ordinances. Drawings showing all
improvements as built shall be filed with the City Clerk.
D. No final plat shall be approved by the City
Council on land subject to flooding or containing poor drainage
facilities and on land which would make adequate drainage of the
streets and lots impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to
make improvements which will, in the opinion of the City Engineer,
make the area completely safe for residential occupancy and
provide adequate street and lot drainage, and conform to
applicable regulations of other agencies such as the U.S. Corps of
Engineers or the Department of Natural Resources the final plat of
the subdivision may be approved. In addition, such plats may not
be approved if the cost of providing municipal services to protect
the flood plain area would impose an unreasonable economic burden
upon the City.

E. All of the required improvements to be
installed under the provisions of this Ordinance shall be
inspected during the course of their construction by the City
Engineer. All of the inspection costs pursuant thereto shall be

part of the required improvements, the contracts for these
improvements shall be made by the City, and the subdivider shall
pay and deposit within the City the subdivider's required share of
construction costs before the City shall proceed.
3. Notwithstanding an election by the City
to install all or any part of the required improvements in any
given subdivision, in no instance shall the improvements to be
installed by the City under this subdivision cause the City to
exceed the legally imposed limitation upon the City's bonded
indebtedness or $500,000, whichever limitation provides for the
smaller amount of participation.
4. Notwithstanding any election on the part
of the City to make the improvements set forth herein, the City of
Alexandria shall reserve the right to approve City participation,
in all or any portion of a proposed subdivision and thereby

required by standards and specifications approved by the City
Council.
11-29
B. 1. Water facilities shall be installed or
arranged for by the developer pursuant to plans and specifications
approved by the City of Alexandria.
2. The costs of water main or facility
installation shall be fully borne by the subdivider or developer
which shall include all of the engineering, direct and indirect
project costs incurred by the City of Alexandria, and which shall
be paid pursuant to the terms of Subdivision 2 of this Section
11.07 of the Alexandria City Code.
3. In addition to the direct project costs
borne by the developer, a benefit charge for the privilege of
connecting to existing City of Alexandria water system lines shall
be imposed. The benefit charge shall be established by Resolution
of the Alexandria City Council and shall be based upon the
following principals:
12/11/19 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-30
(a) Residential water mains shall be
designated as (6") six inch I.D. pipe. In areas zoned commercial,
water mains shall be designated as (8") eight inch I.D. pipe. All
other water mains (such as those used to serve industry) shall be
determined based upon the area to be served at the time of
installation.
(b) When the Alexandria City Engineer
determines that a larger than (6") six inch I.D. pipe must be
installed in a residential area to serve as a supply main and is
required instead of the standard (6") six inch I.D. pipe, the City
shall be obligated to pay for the oversizing of the (6") six inch
water main, which shall be the costs in excess of the (6") six
inch pipe.
(c) When the Alexandria City Engineer
determines that a larger than (8") eight inch I.D. pipe must be
installed in place of the standard (8") eight inch I.D. pipe, the
City shall be obligated to pay for the oversizing of the (8")
eight inch water main, which shall be the costs in excess of the
(8") eight inch I.D. pipe.
C. Where the water facilities are not available
for extension into the proposed subdivision, the City Council may,
by ordinance, grant a franchise for such water facilities, to
serve all properties within a subdivision where a complete and
adequate neighborhood water distribution system is designed in
11-30
conjunction with the subdivision, and complete plans for the
systems are submitted for the approval of the City Council.
D. Where City sewer and water facilities are not
available for extension into the proposed subdivision, the Council
may permit the use of individual water and sewer systems in
accordance with appropriate State regulations.
Subd. 5. Public Utilities.
A. Where feasible, in the opinion of the
Engineer, all utilities lines for telephone and electric service
shall be placed in rear line easements when carried on overhead
poles.
B. Where telephone, electric and/or gas service
lines are to be placed underground entirely, conduits or cables
shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways, in such
a manner so as not to conflict with other underground services.
All drainage and other underground utility installations which
traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements
furnished by the subdivider.

Section 11.08. Registered Land Surveys and Conveyance by
Metes and Bounds.
Subd. 1. Registered Land Surveys. It is the intention
of this Ordinance that all registered land surveys in the City of
Alexandria should be presented to the Planning Commission in the
form of a preliminary plat in accordance with the standards set
forth in this Ordinance for preliminary plats and that the
Planning Commission shall first approve the arrangement, sizes,
and relationship of proposed tracts in such registered land
surveys, and that tracts to be used as easements or roads should
be so dedicated. Unless a recommendation and approval have been
obtained from the Planning Commission and City Council
respectively, in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Ordinance, building permits will be withheld for buildings on
tracts which have been so subdivided by registered land surveys
and the City may refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or
to improve, repair or maintain any such tracts unless so approved.
Section 11.09. Variances
Subd. 1. General.
A. The Planning Commission may recommend a
variance from the provision of the Ordinance when, in its option,
undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In recommending
any variance, the Commission shall prescribe only conditions that
it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In
11-31
making its recommendation, the Planning Commission shall take into
account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing
use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or
work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. A
variance shall only be recommended when the Planning Commission
finds that at least one (1) of the following conditions exist:
1. That there are special circumstances or
conditions affecting said property such that the strict
application of the provision of this Ordinance would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of his land.
2. That the granting of the variance will
not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other
property in the territory in which property is situated.
3. That the variance is to correct
inequities resulting from an extreme physical hardship such as
topography, water conditions, or unusual shape.
6/30/03 THIS PAGE REPLACES PAGE 11-32
4. That there exists inadequate access to
direct sunlight for solar energy systems, or
5. That similar conditions exist or have
been granted to other property owners in the surrounding area.
B. Any recommendations for variances to the City
Council in connection with the acceptance of the final plat of a
subdivision shall be made through the Planning Commission.
C. After consideration of the Planning Commission
recommendation, the City Council may grant by majority vote
variances of this Ordinance subject to the findings and conditions
noted in Section 11.09, Subd. 1A of this Ordinance.
Section 11.10. Fees. The fees for subdivision,
resubdivision, exception to platting (split), and variance
applications shall be established by the Alexandria City Council.
Section 11.11. Violations of Penalty.
Subd. 1. Sale of Lots from Unrecorded Plats. It shall
be unlawful to sell, trade, or otherwise convey or offer to sell,
trade, or otherwise convey any lot or parcel of land as a part of,
or in conformity with any plan, plat or replat of any subdivision
or area located within jurisdiction of this Ordinance unless said
plan, plat or replat shall have first been recorded in the office
of the County Recorder of Douglas County.
11-32
Subd. 2. Receiving or Recording Unapproved Plats. It
shall be unlawful to receive or record in any public office any
plans, plats or replats of land laid out in building lots and
streets, alleys, or other portions of the same intended to be
dedicated to public or private use, or for the use of purchasers
or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent thereto, and located
within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, unless the same shall
bear thereon, by endorsement or otherwise, the approval of the
City Council.
Subd. 3. Misrepresentation as to Construction,
Supervision, or Inspection of Improvements. It shall be unlawful
for any person, firm or corporation owning an addition or
subdivision of land within the City to represent that any
improvement upon any of the streets, alleys or avenues of said
addition or subdivision or any sewer in said addition or
subdivision has been constructed according to the plans and
specifications approved by the City Council, or has been
supervised or inspected by the City, when such improvements have
not been so constructed, supervised or inspected.
Subd. 4. Penalty. Anyone violating any of the
provisions of this Ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
each month during which compliance is delayed shall constitute a
separate offense.

CHAPTER 12
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Section 12.01 General Provisions
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization and General Policy.
This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization and
policies contained in Minnesota Statutes Chapters 103B, 105,
462, and 497, Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, and
Minnesota Rules Chapters 8410 and 8420 and goals and policies
contained in the most recent Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan for the City of Alexandria.
Subd. 2. Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to
set forth the minimum requirements for stormwater management
that will diminish threats to public health, safety, public and
private property and natural resources of the City by
establishing performance standards including:
A. Protect life and property from dangers and damages
associated with flooding.
B. Protect public and private property from damage
resulting from runoff or erosion.
C. Control the annual runoff rates from post development
site conditions to match the annual runoff rates from
predevelopment site conditions.
D. Promote site design that minimizes the generation of
stormwater and maximizes pervious areas for stormwater
treatment.
E. Promote regional stormwater management by watershed.
F. Provide a single, consistent set of performance
standards that apply to all developments.
G. Protect water quality from nutrients, pathogens, toxics,
debris and thermal stress.
H. Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge.
I. Provide a vegetated corridor (buffer) to protect water
resources from development.
J. Protect or improve the water quality of local lakes,
wetlands and water bodies.
K. Protect and enhance fish, wildlife and habitat and
recreational opportunities.
L. Control runoff volumes resulting from development
within designated sub-watersheds through appropriate
infiltration practices.
12-2
Subd. 3. Scope. No person shall develop any land for
residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses
without having provided stormwater management measures that
control or manage runoff from such developments as provided in
this Section.
Section 12.02 Definitions. Unless specifically defined below,
words or phrases used in this Section shall be interpreted so
as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage
and to give this Section its most reasonable application. For
the purpose of this Section, the words “must” and “shall”
are mandatory and not permissive. All distances, unless
otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally.
A. Applicant - Any person or group that applies for a
building permit, subdivision approval, or a permit
to allow land disturbing activities. Applicant also
means that person's agents, employees, and others
acting under this person's or group’s direction. The
term “applicant” also refers to the permit holder or
holders and the permit holder’s agents, employees,
and others acting under this person's or group’s
direction.
B. Best Management Practice (BMP) - Best management
practice is a technique or series of techniques
which are proven to be effective in controlling
runoff, erosion and sedimentation.
C. Buffer - A regulated area where scrutiny will be
exercised over activities near wetlands and water
bodies and a non-disturbance area where natural
vegetation must be maintained.
D. Common Plan of Development or Sale - A contiguous area
where multiple separate and distinct land disturbing
activities may be taking place at different times,
or on different schedules, but under one proposed
plan. This item is broadly defined to include
design, permit application, advertisement or physical
demarcation indicating that land disturbing
activities may occur.
E. Developer - Any person, group, firm, corporation,
sole proprietorship, partnership, state agency, or
political subdivision thereof engaged in a land
disturbance activity.
12-3
F. Development - Any land disturbance activity that
changes the site’s runoff characteristics in
conjunction with residential, commercial, industrial
or institutional construction or alteration.
G. Dewatering - The removal of water for construction
activity. It can be a discharge of appropriated
surface or groundwater to dry and/or solidify a
construction site. It may require Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources permits to be
appropriated and if contaminated may require other
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) permits to
be discharged.
H. Discharge - The release, conveyance, channeling,
runoff, or drainage, of storm water including
snowmelt, from a construction site.
I. Energy Dissipation - This refers to methods employed
at pipe outlets to prevent erosion. Examples
include, but are not limited to; aprons, riprap,
splash pads, and gabions that are designed to
prevent erosion.
J. Erosion - Any process that wears away the surface
of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or
gravity.
K. Erosion Control - Refers to methods employed to
prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization
practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or
permanent cover, and construction phasing.
L. Exposed Soil Areas - All areas of the construction
site where the vegetation (trees, shrubs, brush,
grasses, etc.) or impervious surface has been
removed, thus rendering the soil more prone to
erosion. This includes topsoil stockpile areas,
borrow areas and disposal areas within the
construction site. It does not include temporary
stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand, gravel,
concrete or bituminous, which have less stringent
protection. Once soil is exposed, it is considered
“exposed soil,” until it meets the definition of
“final stabilization.”
12-4
M. Filter Strips - A vegetated section of land designed
to treat runoff as overland sheet flow. Their dense
vegetated cover facilitates pollutant removal and
infiltration.
N. Final Stabilization - Means that all soil disturbing
activities at the site have been completed, and
that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without
large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a
density of seventy (70) percent of the cover for
unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent
structures has been established, or equivalent
permanent stabilization measures have been employed.
Simply sowing grass seed is not considered final
stabilization. Where agricultural land is involved,
such as when pipelines are built on crop or range
land, final stabilization constitutes returning the
land to its preconstruction agricultural use.
For individual lots in residential construction by
either: (a) The homebuilder completing final
stabilization as specified above, or (b) the
homebuilder establishing temporary stabilization
including perimeter controls for an individual lot
prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and
informing the homeowner of the need for, and benefits
of, final stabilization. (Homeowners typically have
an incentive to put in the landscaping functionally
equivalent to final stabilization as quick as
possible to keep mud out of their homes and off
sidewalks and driveways.); or
For construction projects on land used for
agricultural purposes (e.g., pipelines across crop or
range land) final stabilization may be accomplished by
returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction
agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not
previously used for agricultural activities, such as
buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface waters
and drainage systems, and areas which are not being
returned to their preconstruction agricultural use
must meet the final stabilization criteria in (a) or
(b) above.
O. Hydric Soils - Soils that are saturated, flooded, or
ponded long enough during the growing season to
develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.
12-5
P. Hydrophytic Vegetation - Macrophytic (large enough to
be observed by the naked eye) plant life growing in
water, soil or on a substrate that is at least
periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of
excessive water content.
Q. Illicit Discharge - Any direct or indirect nonstormwater
discharges to the storm drain system,
except exempted in Section 12.13 of this Ordinance.
R. Illicit Connection - Any drain or conveyance, whether
on the surface or subsurface, which allows an illegal
discharge to enter the storm drain system including,
but not limited to, any conveyances which allow any
non-storm water discharge including sewage, process
wastewater, and wash water to enter the storm drain
system and any connections to the storm drain system
from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether
said drain or connection had been previously allowed,
permitted, or approved by the City; or, any drain or
conveyance connected from a commercial or industrial
land use to the storm drain system which has not been
documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records and
approved by the City.
S. Impervious Surface - A constructed hard surface that
either prevents or retards the entry of water into
the soil, and causes water to run off the surface
in greater quantities and at an increased rate of
flow than existed prior to development. Examples
include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways,
parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt,
or gravel roads.
T. Land Disturbance Activity - Any land change that may
result in soil erosion from water or wind and the
movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands
within this government’s jurisdiction, including
construction, clearing & grubbing, grading,
excavating, transporting and filling of land. Within
the context of this Section, land disturbance
activity does not mean: Minor land disturbance
activities such as home gardens and an individual’s
home landscaping, repairs, and maintenance work,
unless such activity exceeds one half acre in
exposed soil. Additions or modifications to existing
12-6
single family structures which result in creating
under one half acre of exposed soil or impervious
surface and/or is part of a larger common
development plan. Construction, installation, and
maintenance of fences, signs, posts, poles, and
electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines
or individual service connections to these
utilities, which result in creating under one half
acre of exposed soil or impervious surface. Tilling,
planting, or harvesting of agricultural,
horticultural, or silvicultural (forestry) crops.
Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and
emergency repairs, unless the land disturbing
activity would have otherwise required an approved
erosion and sediment control plan, except for the
emergency. If such a plan would have been required,
then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and
stabilized in accordance with the City’s requirements
as soon as possible.
U. Land Locked Basin – Defined as a low area such as a
lake, pond, or wetland entirely surrounded by land
with no regularly active outlet channel.
V. Large Site Construction Activity - Includes
clearing, grading or excavation that disturbs one
(1) or more acres or less than five acres of total
land area that is part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will
disturb five (5) acres or more.
W. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) - The program for issuing, modifying,
revoking, reissuing, terminating, monitoring, and

existing in Minnesota at the time of statehood in
1858) group of plant species native to the local
region, that were not introduced as a result of
European settlement or subsequent human introduction.
Y. Non-Stormwater Discharge - Any discharge to the storm
drain system that is not composed entirely of
12-7
stormwater.
Z. Ordinary High Water Mark - The boundary of public
waters and wetlands, and shall be an elevation
delineating the highest water level which has been
maintained for a sufficient period of time to leave
evidence upon the landscape, commonly that point
where the natural vegetation changes from
predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial.
For watercourses, the ordinary high water level is
the elevation of the top of the bank of the
channel. For reservoirs and flowages, the ordinary
high water level is the operating elevation of the
normal summer pool.
AA. Owner - The person or party possessing the title of
the land on which the construction activities will
occur; or if the construction activity is for a lease
holder, the party or individual identified as the
lease holder; or the contracting government agency
responsible for the construction activity.
BB. Paved Surface - A constructed hard, smooth surface
made of asphalt, concrete or other pavement
material. Examples include, but are not limited to,
roads, sidewalks, driveways and parking lots.
CC. Permanent Cover - Means “final stabilization.”
Examples include grass, gravel, asphalt, and
concrete. See also the definition of “final
stabilization.”
DD. Permit - Within the context of this Section a
“permit” is a written warrant or license granted for
construction, subdivision approval, or to allow land
disturbing activities.
EE. Phased Project or Development - Clearing a parcel of
land in distinct phases, with at least fifty percent
(50%) of the project’s preceding phase meeting the
definition of “final stabilization” and the
remainder proceeding toward completion, before
beginning the next phase of clearing.
FF. Prohibited Discharge - Any substance which, when
discharged has potential to or does any of the
following: (1) Interferes with state designated water
12-8
uses; (2) Obstructs or causes damage to waters of the
state; (3) Changes water color, odor, or usability as
a drinking water source through causes not
attributable to natural stream processes affecting
surface water or subsurface processes affecting
groundwater; (4) Adds an unnatural surface film on
the water; (5) Adversely changes other chemical,
biological, thermal, or physical condition, in any
surface water or stream channel; (6) Degrades the

earth's surface either above or below water level.
II. Sedimentation - The process or action of depositing
sediment.
JJ. Sediment Control - The methods employed to prevent
sediment from leaving the development site. Examples

sedimentation basins.
KK. Small Site Construction Activity - Includes
clearing, grading or excavation, that disturbs onehalf
acre (½) to one (1) acre, or less than one (1)
acre of total land area that is part of a larger
12-9
common plan of development or sale that will
ultimately disturb equal to or greater than one (1)
acre.
LL. Soil - The unconsolidated mineral and organic
material on the immediate surface of the earth. For
the purposes of this document temporary stockpiles
of clean sand, gravel, aggregate, concrete or
bituminous materials (which have less stringent
protection) are not considered “soil” stockpiles.
MM. Stabilized - The exposed ground surface after it has
been covered by sod, erosion control blanket,
riprap, pavement or other material that prevents
erosion. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered
stabilization.
NN. Steep Slope - Any slope steeper than twelve (12)
percent (Twelve (12) feet of rise for every one
hundred (100) feet horizontal run).
OO. Storm Drain System - The city-owned facilities by
which stormwater is collected or conveyed, including,
but not limited to, any roads with drainage systems,
municipal streets, gutters, curbs, inlets, piped
storm drains, pumping facilities, retention and
detention basins, natural and human-made or altered
drainage channels, reservoirs, and other drainage
structures.
PP. Stormwater - Under Minnesota Rule 7077.0105, subpart
41b stormwater, “means precipitation runoff,
stormwater runoff, snow melt runoff, and any other
surface runoff and drainage. Stormwater does not
include construction site dewatering.
QQ. Stormwater Management Plan (also referred to as
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan SWPPP) - A
joint stormwater and erosion and sediment control
plan that is a document containing the requirements
of this Section, that when implemented will decrease
soil erosion on a parcel of land and off-site
nonpoint pollution. It may involve both temporary
and permanent controls.

state or any portion thereof.”
YY. Wet Detention Facility - Depressions constructed by
excavation and embankment procedures to store excess
runoff temporarily on a site. After a runoff event,
overflow from the pond is released at a controlled
rate by an outlet device designed to release flows
at various peak rates and elevations until the design
12-11
elevation of the pool is reached. Wet detention
facilities maintain a permanent pool of water between
storm events. Wet detention facilities are located to
collect stormwater inflows from adjacent drainage
areas and are usually designed to control peak
discharges from relatively large design storms.
ZZ. Wetland - As defined in Minnesota Rules 7050.0130,
subpart F, “. . . ‘wetlands’ are those areas that
are inundated or saturated by surface water or
groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient
to support, and that under normal circumstances do
support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands
generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar
areas. Constructed wetlands designed for wastewater
treatment are not waters of the state.

Subd. 3. Permit Transfer. A permit runs with the
property it covers, until the permitted activities are
completed, and is transferable to new landowners in its
entirety or by parcel, with each parcel being subject to the
permit and any conditions that apply to that parcel. In the
event land under such a permit is transferred or conveyed in
fee, such transfer or conveyance must be reported in writing
to the City and the new landowner within 7 days of the
transfer. This section refers to City-issued permits and does
not release the permittee or owner from transfer requirements
of a NPDES permit.
Section 12.06 Stormwater Management Plan Review Procedures.
Subd. 1. Review Timeframe. The City will complete a
review of the plan within twenty (20) days of receiving the
plan from the developer.
Subd. 2. Meeting Requirements. If the City determines
that the plan meets the requirements of this Ordinance, the
City shall issue a permit valid for a specified period of time
that authorizes the land disturbance activity contingent on the
implementation and completion of the plan.
Subd. 3. Not Meeting Requirements. If the City determines
that the plan does not meet the requirements of this
Ordinance, the City shall not issue a permit for the land
disturbance activity. The plan must be resubmitted for
approval before the land disturbance activity begins. All land
use and building permits shall be suspended until the developer

Subd. 4. Amendments. The applicant must amend the plan as
necessary to include additional requirements such as
additional or modified BMPs designed to correct problems
identified or address situations whenever:
A. A change in design, construction, operation,
maintenance, weather, or seasonal conditions that has
a significant effect on the discharge of pollutants
to surface waters or underground waters.
B. Inspections indicate the plan is not effective in
eliminating or significantly minimizing the discharge
of pollutants to surface waters or underground waters
or that the discharges are causing water quality
standard exceedances.
12-18
C. The plan is not achieving the general objectives of
controlling pollutants or is not consistent with the
terms and conditions of the permit.
Section 12.07 Waivers. The City Council, upon recommendation
of the City Engineer, may waive a requirement of this
Ordinance upon making a finding that the alternate design of
the application will not adversely affect the standards of
this Ordinance and the waiver of such requirement will not
adversely affect the standards and requirements set forth in
this Ordinance. The City Council may require as a condition of
the waiver, such dedication or construction, or agreement to
dedicate or construct as may be necessary to adequately meet
said standards and requirements.
Section 12.08 Stormwater Management Plan Inspections and
Enforcement.
Subd. 1. Inspections. The City will conduct inspections
on a regular basis to ensure that the plan is properly
installed and maintained. In all cases the inspectors will
attempt to work with the builder or developer to maintain
proper erosion and sediment control at all sites. In cases
where cooperation is withheld, the City shall issue
construction stop work orders, until erosion and sediment
control measures meet the requirements of this Ordinance. An
inspection must follow before work can commence. Inspections
are required as follows:
A. Before any land disturbing activity begins.
B. For residential construction, at the time of footing,
framing and final inspections.
C. At the completion of the project.
D. Prior to the release of any financial securities, if
applicable.
E. Random inspections during the course of the project
to ensure compliance with the SWPPP, including after a
storm event greater than 0.5 inches over 24 hours.
Subd. 2. Notification of Failure of the SWPPP. The City
shall notify the permit holder of the failure of the SWPPP’s
measures.
A. Initial contact. The initial contact will be to the
party or parties listed on the application and/or the
plan as contacts. Except during an emergency action,
12-19
forty-eight (48) hours after notification by the City
or seventy-two (72) hours after the failure of erosion
control measures, whichever is less, the City at its
discretion, may begin corrective work. Such
notification should be in writing, but if it is
verbal, a written notification should follow as quickly
as practical. If after making a good faith effort to
notify the responsible party or parties, the City has
been unable to establish contact, the City may proceed
with corrective work. There are conditions when time
is of the essence in controlling erosion. During such
a condition the City may take immediate action, and
then notify the applicant as soon as possible.
B. Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter
of the site, the applicant shall immediately develop
a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the right-of
entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement
the cleanup and restoration plan within forty-eight
(48) hours of obtaining the adjoining property
owner’s permission. In no case, unless written
approval is received from the City, may more than
seven (7) calendar days go by without corrective
action being taken. If in the discretion of the City,
the permit holder does not repair the damage caused
by the erosion, the City may do the remedial work
required. When restoration to wetlands and other
resources are required, the applicant shall be
required to work with the appropriate agency to ensure
that the work is done properly.
C. Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If
eroded soils (including tracked soils from
construction activities) enters streets, wetlands, or
other water bodies, cleanup and repair shall be
immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic
control and flagging required to protect the traveling
public during the cleanup operations.
Subd. 3. Failure to do Corrective Work. When an applicant
fails to conform to any provision of this policy within the
time stipulated, the City may take the following actions.
A. Issue a stop work order, withhold the scheduling of
inspections and/or the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy.
B. Revoke any permit issued by the City to the applicant
12-20
for the site in question or any other of the
applicant’s sites within the City’s jurisdiction.
C. Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor to correct
the deficiency. The issuance of a permit constitutes a
right-of-entry for the City or its contractor to enter
upon the construction site for the purpose of
correcting deficiencies in erosion control.
D. Require reimbursement to the City for all costs
incurred in correcting stormwater pollution control
deficiencies. If payment is not made within thirty (30)
days after the City incurs costs, the City will halt
all work on the project site and assess any
reimbursement costs to the property. As a condition
of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any
assessment hearing to be conducted by the City, concur
that the benefit to the property exceeds the amount
of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights by
virtue of Minnesota Statute 429.081 to challenge the
amount or validity of assessment.
Subd. 4. Right of Entry and Inspection.
A. Powers. The applicant shall allow the City of
Alexandria and their authorized representatives, upon
presentation of credentials to:
1. Enter upon the permitted site for the purpose of
obtaining information, examination of records,
conducting investigations or surveys.
2. Bring such equipment upon the permitted development
as is necessary to conduct such surveys and
investigations.
3. Examine and copy any books, papers, records, or
memoranda pertaining to activities or records
required to be kept under the terms and conditions
of this permitted site.
4. Inspect the stormwater pollution control measures.
5. Sample and monitor any items or activities
pertaining to stormwater pollution control
measures.
Section 12.09 Development Agreement. A development agreement
regarding stormwater management may be required for any
project that requires a Stormwater Management Plan. The
agreement shall guarantee the performance of the work described
and delineated on the approved plan. In addition, the agreement
will describe the City’s inspection policy. Should the
applicant fail to meet any of the terms of the development
12-21
agreement, the City may proceed with any of the actions listed
on Subd.11.B.
Section 12.10 Construction Activities. Construction
operations must at a minimum comply with any applicable
federal or state permit and stormwater management plan in
addition to the following best management practices:
Subd. 1. Site Dewatering: Water pumped from the site
shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, grit
chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers, hydrocyclones, soil
concentrators or other appropriate controls as deemed
necessary. Water may not be discharged in a manner that
causes erosion, sedimentation, or flooding on the site, on
downstream properties, in the receiving channels, or in any
wetland.
Subd. 2. Waste and Material Disposal: All waste and
unused building materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning
wastes, wastewater, petroleum based products, paints, toxic
materials, or other hazardous materials) shall be properly
disposed of off-site and shall not be allowed to be carried by
runoff into a receiving channel, storm sewer system, or
wetland.
Subd. 3. Tracking Management: Each site shall have roads,
access drives and parking areas of sufficient width, length
and surfacing to minimize sediment from being tracked onto
public or private roadways. Any material deposited by vehicles
or other construction equipment onto a public or private road
shall be removed (not by flushing) before the end of each
working day.
Subd. 4. Water Quality Protection: The construction
contractor, including the general contractor and all
subcontractors, shall be required to control oil and fuel
spills and chemical discharges to prevent such spills or
discharges from entering any watercourse, sump, sewer system,
water body, or wetland.
Subd. 5. Site Erosion and Sedimentation Control:
Construction operations must include erosion and sedimentation
control measures meeting accepted design criteria, standards
and specifications contained in the Minnesota Stormwater
Manual or other standards determined acceptable by the City.
12-22
Subd. 6. Concrete Washout Area: All liquids and solid
waste generated by concrete washout operations must be
contained in a leak-proof containment facility or impermeable
liner. A compacted clay liner that does not allow washout
liquids to enter ground water is considered an impermeable
liner. A sign must be installed adjacent to each washout
facility to inform concrete equipment operators to utilize the
proper facilities.
Subd. 7. Storm Drain Protection: All storm drain inlets
shall be protected during construction with control measures
as contained in the SWPPP. These devices shall remain in
place until final stabilization of the site. A regular
inspection and maintenance plan shall be developed in
implemented to assure these devices are operational at all
times. Storm drain protection must conform to the protection
alternatives pre-approved by City Staff and available at City
Hall and on the City Website.
Subd. 8. Soil Stockpiling: All exposed soil areas must be
stabilized as soon as possible to limit soil erosion but in no
case later than 14 days after the construction activity in that
portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased.
Temporary clean aggregate stockpiles, demolition concrete
stockpiles, sand stockpiles and the constructed base components
of roads are exempt from this requirement.
Section 12.11 Stormwater Management Criteria for Permanent
Facilities. All permanent stormwater management plans must be
submitted to the City engineer prior to the start of
construction activity. Designers are expected to follow the
requirements of this section to meet the volume control, water
quality, and water quantity requirements of the City of
Alexandria. Designs should meet the stormwater design standard
of these ordinances and the Minnesota Stormwater Manual.
Deviations from the recommended guidance will require detailed
written explanation with discretion given by the City.
Stormwater control facilities included as part of the final
design for a permanent development shall be addressed in the
stormwater management plan and shall meet the following
criteria:
Subd. 1. Rate Control Requirements: Future discharge rates
from new development and redevelopment, resulting in one-half
acre or more of new impervious area or one acre or more of
disturbed land, will not exceed existing discharge rates for the
12-23
2-year, 10-year, and 100-year critical storm events in
accordance to the Atlas14 data as shown in the table below:
Event
Rainfall/Snowmelt Depth
(inches)
2-year, 24 hour 2.55
10-year, 24 hour 3.69
100-year, 24 hour 5.96
100-year, 10 day snowmelt 8.91
In any area where downstream flooding is a concern the City may
require additional rate control. Design calculations for the 2-
year, 10-year, and 100-year storm events must be submitted to
the City for review and approval. For regional detention or
stormwater management system, the city engineer shall recommend
a proposed system charge to be administered by the City Council
based upon an approved watershed master plan and an analysis of
required drainage systems, projected costs and flood protection
benefits provided to those properties directly or indirectly
impacted by the regional detention or stormwater management
system.
Subd. 2. Design of Storage Facilities: The design of
stormwater storage facilities shall accommodate a 100-year
critical duration rainfall event, with this storage being
provided above the normal outlet elevation.
Subd. 3. Design of Lateral and Collector Systems: Lateral
and collector systems shall be designed to accommodate a 10-year
return frequency storm event. These systems shall be defined as
storm sewer that collects and conveys runoff from catch basins
or other inlets from a localized drainage area to a trunk system
or ponding facility.
Subd. 4. Design of Trunk Systems: Trunk systems shall be
designed to convey the anticipated 100-year critical event
stormwater flow rate. A trunk system shall be defined as the
main channel of the stormwater system that receives water from
multiple laterals or collectors or serves as an outlet and
downstream conveyance system for a stormwater storage facility.
The following table shall be used for the calculation of peak
rates using the Rational Method:
Cover Type Runoff Coefficient
Single-family Residential 0.4
Multi-family Residential 0.5
Commercial 0.7
12-24
Industrial 0.7
Parks, Open Space 0.2
Ponds, Wetlands 1.0
Subd. 5. Overland Overflow: An overland overflow should be
provided for all lateral, collector, and trunk systems to
accommodate the 100-year critical duration rainfall event and
prevent structural inundation should an obstruction occur in
these systems.
Subd. 6. Clogging Factor: For collection systems not
designed to meet rate control standards (e.g. catch basins) a
clogging factor of 50% will be utilized in sizing intake
structures.
Subd. 7. Rate Control Diameter: No orifice having a
diameter less than 4” is allowed in the design of rate control
structures within the City. If a lower discharge rate is
required a weir may be used to meet the requirements.
Subd. 8. Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway
(emergency outlet) from ponding areas shall be installed a
minimum of one foot below the lowest building opening and shall
be designed to have a capacity to overflow water at an elevation
below the lowest building opening at a rate not less than the
anticipated 100-year peak inflow rate to the basin, or three
times the 100-year peak discharge rate from the basin, whichever
is greater.
Subd. 9. Natural Features of Site: The applicant shall give
consideration to reducing the need for stormwater management
system facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography
and land cover such as wetlands, ponds, natural swales and
depressions as they exist before development to the degree that
they can accommodate the additional water flow without
compromising the integrity or quality of these natural features.
Subd. 10. Landlocked Basins: Areas with landlocked basins
shall be modeled to accommodate a back-to-back 100-year, 24-hour
rainfall event and the 100-year, 10-day runoff event. The
highest water elevation in the basin from this analysis shall be
the 100-year high water level.
Subd. 11. Landlock Basin Outlets: Outlets for landlocked
areas will be allowed provided the outlet complies with wetland
and floodplain regulations and the basin provides storage below
the outlet for either 1) the back-to-back 100-year, 24-hour
12-25
event or 2) the 100-year, 10-day runoff event; whichever is
greater. In addition, there must be no negative downstream
impacts resulting from the outlet.
Subd. 12. Flood Protection:
A. Residential, non-residential and other structures shall
ordinarily be elevated on fill so that the basement, or
first floor if there is no basement, is one (1) foot
above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
B. For areas outside of a floodplain, the lowest floor of a
structure, not including boathouse, piers and docks,
must be three (3) feet above the highest known water
level. In the case where the high water level is
unknown, the elevation of the line of permanent
shoreland vegetation should be used as the high water
elevation.
C. No structure, fill, deposits, obstruction, storage of
materials, equipment, or other uses may be allowed in
the floodplain that reduces the floodwater storage
capacity of the floodplain or increases flood height.
Compensating floodwater storage area shall be provided
for any obstruction which decreases flood storage. This
compensating volume shall be equal to or greater than
the total volume of the obstruction. Additional detail
is provided in the City’s floodplain district.
D. A plan review by the City is required for any project
that is within the 100-year floodplain, upland flood
storage area, or changes the timing, storage, or
carrying capacity of any tributaries in the 100-year
floodplain.
E. All areas at or below the 100-year floodplain area on
private property will be covered by a drainage and
utility easement or outlot dedicated to the City upon
development or redevelopment.
Subd. 13. Water Quality Treatment Standards: Stormwater
treatment must be designed to remove 90% of Total Suspended
Solids (TSS) on an average annual basis. Treatment can be
provided in on-site or regional systems and through permanent
ponding, infiltration, filtration, or a combination of BMPs that
will meet these requirements. This requirement is anticipated to
result in 40-60% Total Phosphorus (TP) removal. The stormwater
12-26
discharges of TSS and TP shall result in no net increase from
pre-project conditions for new development projects. The
stormwater discharges of TSS and TP shall result in a net
reduction from pre-project conditions for redevelopment
projects. Where TSS and/or TP reduction requirements cannot be
met on the site of the original construction, the applicant will
be required to locate alternative sites where TSS and/or TP
treatment standards can be achieved. Mitigation project
locations are chosen in the following order of preference:
A. Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving
water that receives runoff from the original
construction activity.
B. Locations within the same Department of Natural Resource
(DNR) catchment area as the original construction
activity.
C. Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream.
D. Locations anywhere within the City of Alexandria.
Mitigation projects shall involve the establishment new
structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing
structural stormwater BMPs, or the use of a properly designed
regional structural stormwater BMP. Previously required routine
maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs cannot be considered
mitigation. Mitigation projects must be finished within 24
months after the original construction activity begins. A
maintenance agreement specifying the responsible party for longterm
maintenance shall be identified. Payments will not be
accepted in lieu of the construction project meeting the TSS and
TP treatment standards.
Subd. 14. Infiltration/Volume Control: Volume control
measures are required on projects to meet the water quality
criteria of the City and to meet the requirements of the City of
Alexandria’s MS4 Permit obligations. Except where conditions
listed below are not met, stormwater runoff abstraction via
infiltration, evapotranspiration, capture, and/or reuse of
stormwater runoff is required to treat the water quality volume
of one (1) inch (or one (1) inch minus the volume of stormwater
treated by another system on the site) of runoff when a
development project creates one-half acre or more new impervious
surfaces or disturbs one acre or more of land. For new
development projects, stormwater discharge volume shall result
in no net increase from pre-project conditions. For
redevelopment projects, stormwater discharge volume shall result
in a net reduction from pre-project conditions. Runoff must be
12-27
infiltrated within 48 hours or less. To simplify the review
process, no runoff will be assumed from pervious surfaces from a
one inch rainfall event.
Infiltration will not be required nor allowed in areas where
there are known groundwater contaminants, where the soils are
not suitable for infiltration (Hydrologic Soil Group D), or in
areas where there is less than three feet of separation between
the bottom of the infiltration system and the groundwater.
Percolation tests shall be required to verify the infiltration
rates of on-site soils following the construction of
infiltration BMP’s.
Pretreatment of stormwater is required prior to discharge to an
infiltration system. This pretreatment shall collect sediment
and be easily accessed for inspection and maintenance. The
infiltration/filtration system selected must meet the following
criteria:
A. Remove settleable solids, floating materials, and oils
and grease to the maximum extent practicable before
runoff enters the system.
B. Filtration must be designed to remove 90 percent of
total suspended solids.
C. Consider the impact of construction and infiltration
practices on existing hydrologic features (e.g. existing
wetlands) and maintain pre-existing conditions.
D. Consider potential hotspots, groundwater warning, design
measures, maintenance considerations or other retention,
detention, and treatment devises as specified in the MN
Stormwater Manual.
E. The infiltration practice shall not be used within fifty
feet of a municipal, community or private well, unless
specifically allowed by an approved wellhead protection
plan.
F. The infiltration practice shall not be used for runoff
from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas and
industrial areas with exposed materials posing
contamination risk, unless the infiltration practice is
designed to allow for spill containment.
G. Ensure the area is not compacted while the site is under
construction.
H. The infilatration/filtration area shall be staked and
marked so heavy construction vehicles do not compact the
soil.
I. To prevent clogging the system shall have a pretreatment
device such as a vegetated filter strip, small
12-28
sedimentation basin, or water quality inlet (e.g. grit
chamber) to settle particulates before stormwater
discharges into the system.
J. Ensure appropriate on-site testing consistent with the
MN Stormwater Manual is conducted to verify soil type
and to ensure a minimum of three (3) feet of separation
from the seasonally saturated soils (or bedrock) and the
bottom of the proposed system is maintained.
K. Ensure filtration systems with less than three (3) feet
of separation form seasonally saturated soils or from
bedrock are constructed with an impermeable liner.
L. The infiltration practice shall not be used in
Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) D soils without soil
corrections.
M. Provide an eight foot wide maintenance access.
Subd. 15. Permanent Wet Sedimentation and Regional Pond
Water Quality Standards: If infiltration practices are not
feasible, a permanent water quality pond shall be used to meet
water quality and rate control requirements. The pond is
required to meet the following criteria. If a pond is designed
using this criteria, it will be assumed to meet the City
standard of 90% TSS removal and result in approximately 40-60%
TP removal.
A. If the drainage area is within one of the following
subwatersheds that drains directly to a lake: Agnes-
Henry, Burgen, Carlos, Cowdry, Darling, Geneva, Latoka,
Le Homme Dieu, Victoria, or Winona, the permanent pool
(dead pool) volume below the normal outlet must be
greater than or equal to the runoff from a 2.5-inch
storm event over the drainage area (see Figure III-5).
B. If the drainage area is within one of the following
subwatersheds that drains directly to a wetland: Connie,
North Wetlands, SE Wetlands, SW Wetlands, the permanent
pool volume must allow for 1,800 cubic feet for each
acre that drains to the pool (see Figure III-5).
C. Permanent pool average depth between 3 and 10 feet.
D. The basin must provide live storage for water quality
volume of one (1) inch of runoff (or one (1) inch minus
the volume of stormwater treated by another system on
the site) from the new impervious surfaces created by
the project.
12-29
E. The basin must minimize scour and the suspension of
solids.
F. The basin outlet must be designed to prevent shortcircuiting
and the discharge of floating debris, and the
basin outlet must not discharge one inch of runoff from
the impervious watershed area at a rate greater than
5.66 cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre of surface
area of the pond.
G. An emergency outlet to control the 100-year storm event.
H. Basin slopes no steeper than 3:1.
I. A basin shelf (10 feet wide and one (1) foot below the
normal water level) to enhance wildlife habitat, reduce
safety hazards, and improve maintenance access.
J. Flood pool volume above the normal outlet so that peak
discharge rates from the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year
storm events are no greater than existing conditions.
K. An eight foot wide maintenance access must be provided.
L. Be located outside of surface waters or any buffer zone.
M. Natural wetlands and waterbodies are not considered a
regional stormwater pond and construction will not occur
within existing wetlands unless they are mitigated in
accordance with the State of Minnesota Wetland
Conservation Act.
N. Waterways connected to the pond will not be degraded.
O. Safety considerations will be made in the design of
permanent water quality ponds.
Subd. 16. Outlet and Inlet Pipes:
A. Inlet pipes of stormwater ponds shall be extended to the
pond normal water level whenever possible.
B. Outfalls with velocities greater than 4 fps into
channels requires energy dissipation or stilling basins.
C. Outfalls with velocities of less than 4 fps generally do
not require energy dissipaters or stilling basins, but
will require riprap protection.
D. In the case of discharge to channels, riprap shall be
provided on all outlets to an adequate depth below the
channel grade and to a height above the outfall or
channel bottom. Riprap shall be placed over a suitably
graded filter material with filter fabric to ensure that
soil particles do not migrate through the riprap and
12-30
reduce its stability. Riprap shall be placed to a
thickness at least 2 times the mean rock diameter to
ensure that it will not be undermined or rendered
ineffective by displacement. If riprap is used as
protection for overland drainage routes, grouting may be
recommended.
E. Discharge velocity into a pond at the outlet elevation
shall be 6 fps or less. Riprap protection, or other
appropriate energy dissipation practice, is required at
all inlet pipes into ponds from the NWL to the pond
bottom.
F. Where outlet velocities to ponds exceed 6 fps, the
design should be based on the unique site conditions
present. Submergence of the outlet or installation of a
stilling basin approved by the City is required when
erosive outlet velocities are experienced.
G. Submerged outlet pipes from ponds are not allowed.
Subd. 17. Limitations and Restrictions for Permanent
Stormwater Management: The City may limit or restrict the
construction of permanent management facilities based on the
following criteria.
A. Permanent stormwater management facilities may not
receive discharges from or be constructed in areas
where:
1. Industrial facilities are not authorized to
infiltrate industrial stormwater under an NPDES
Industrial Stormwater permit issued by the MPCA.
2. Vehicle fueling or maintenance activities occur.
3. There is less than three feet of separation between
the bottom of the infiltration system to the
elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or the
top of bedrock.
4. There are known groundwater contaminants or
groundwater will be mobilized by the construction of
infiltration BMPs.
B. For areas where infiltration is prohibited the applicant
must consider alternative volume reduction BMPs and the
water quality volume must be treated by a wet
sedimentation basin, filtration system, regional ponding
12-31
or similar method prior to the release of stormwater to
surface water.
C. For linear projects with lack of right-of-way, easements
or other permissions from property owners to install
treatment systems that are capable of treating the total
water quality volume on site, the project must maximize
treatment through other methods or combination of
methods before runoff is released to nearby surface
waters. Alternative treatment options include: grassed
swales, filtration systems, smaller ponds, or grit
chambers. In all circumstances, a reasonable attempt
must be made to obtain right-of-way during the project
planning and all attempts of infeasibility must be
recorded.
D. The City may restrict the use of infiltration features
to meet post-construction requirements for stormwater
management, without higher engineering review, if the
infiltration techniques will be constructed in the
following areas where:
1. Soils are predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D
(clay) soils.
2. Drinking Water Supply Management Areas are present,
as defined by Minn. R. 4720.51000, subp.13, unless
precluded by a local unit of government with an MS4
permit.
3. Soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per
hour unless soils are amended to flow the
infiltration rate below 8.3 inches per hour.
Sub. 18. Exceptions for Permanent Stormwater Management:
The City may authorize reduced volume control for the following
situations:
A. If the project meets one of the limitations outlined
above.
B. If the applicant implements to the maximum extent
possible other volume reduction practices, besides
infiltration, on the site but may not meet the
requirements for post-construction stormwater
management.
Subd. 19. Drainage and Utility Easements: New stormwater
management BMPs (e.g. ponds, infiltration systems, swales)
12-32
constructed as part of private development shall be covered by
drainage and utility easements or outlots that are dedicated to
the City. Maintenance responsibilities for these areas will be
spelled out in a Developer’s Agreement. All maintenance
agreements must be approved by the City and recorded at the
Douglas County rRecorder’s office prior to final plan approval.
At a minimum, the maintenance agreement will describe the
following inspection and maintenance obligations:
A. No private stormwater facilities may be approved unless
a maintenance plan is provided that defines how access
will be provided, who will conduct the maintenance, the
type of maintenance and the maintenance intervals. At a
minimum, all private stormwater facilities shall be
inspected annually and maintained in proper condition
consistent with the performance goals for which they
were originally designed and as executed in the
stormwater facilities maintenance agreement.
B. The party who is permanently responsible for maintenance
of the structural and nonstructural measures.
C. Pass responsibilities for such maintenance to successors
in title.
D. Allow the City and its representatives the right of
entry for the purposes of inspecting all permanent
stormwater management systems.
E. Allow the City the right to repair and maintain the
facility, if necessary maintenance is not performed
after proper and reasonable notice to the responsible
party of the permanent stormwater management system.
F. The agreement shall also stipulate that if site
configuration or structural stormwater BMPs change,
causing decreased structural stormwater BMP
effectiveness, new or improved BMPs shall be installed.
G. Access to all stormwater facilities must be inspected
annually and maintained as necessary. The applicant
shall obtain all necessary easement or other property
interests to allow access to the facilities for
inspection or maintenance for both the responsible party
and the City of Alexandria.
Subd. 20. Skimmers: The City requires skimmers or other
devices, with the intent to remove floatables, in the
construction of new pond outlets and the addition of skimmers to
12-33
existing systems whenever feasible and practical. The designs
shall provide for skimmers that extend a minimum of four inches
below the water surface and minimize the velocities of water
passing under the skimmer to less than 0.5 feet per second for
rainfall events having a 99% frequency. Wood skimmers are not
allowed.
Subd. 21. Habitat and Aesthetic Enhancement: The City
encourages the design of stormwater management features that
provide an opportunity to enhance the habitat and aesthetics of
the area. This includes providing upland buffers around ponds,
seeding the area with native vegetation, and designing the
slopes equal to or flatter than 4:1.
Subd.22. Combination of Practices: A combination of
successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable
minimum control requirements specified. Justification
Section 12.12 Buffer Protection for Wetlands. For all
development which changes land use or requires platting, a
minimum 10- foot buffer of native vegetation is required around
wetlands. Public trails and management of noxious weeds are
allowed within the buffer. Planting of non-native species is
not allowed within the buffer.
Section 12.13 Stormwater and Urban Runoff Pollution Control.
Subd. 1. Illegal Disposal
A. No person shall throw, deposit, place, leave,
maintain, or keep or permit to be thrown, placed,
left, maintained or kept, any refuse, rubbish, garbage,
or any other discarded or abandoned objects, articles,
or accumulations, in or upon any street, alley,
sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin conduit
or drainage structure, business place, or upon any
public or private plot of land in Alexandria, so that
the same might be or become a pollutant, except in
containers, recycling bags, or other lawfully
established waste disposal facility.
B. No person shall intentionally dispose of grass,
leaves, dirt, or other landscape debris into a water
resource buffer, street, road, alley, catch basin,
culvert, curb, gutter, inlet, ditch, natural
watercourse, flood control channel, canal, storm drain
12-34
or any fabricated natural conveyance.
Subd. 2. Illicit Discharges and Connection.
A. No person shall throw, drain, or otherwise discharge,
cause, or allow others under its control to throw,
drain, or otherwise discharge any pollutants or waters
containing pollutants, other than stormwater to the
municipal storm water system. The following discharges
are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by
this ordinance:
a. Water line flushing, landscape irrigation, diverted
stream flows, rising ground waters, uncontaminated
ground water infiltration, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, discharges from potable water sources,
foundation drains, air conditioning condensation,
irrigation water, springs, water from crawl space
pumps, footing drains, lawn watering, individual
residential car washing, flows from riparian
habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool
discharges, and street wash water;
b. Discharges or flow from firefighting, and other
discharges authorized by the City in writing that
are necessary to protect public health and safety;
c. Discharges associated with dye testing, however this
activity requires verbal notification to the City
prior to the time of the test;
d. The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater
discharge permitted under an NPDES
permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to
the discharger and administered under the authority
of the federal Environmental Protection Agency,
provided that the discharger is in full compliance
with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or
order and other applicable laws and regulations, and
further provided that written approval has been
granted for any discharges to the storm drain
system.
B. No person shall use any illicit connection to
intentionally convey non-storm water to the municipal
storm water system.
a. This prohibition expressly includes, without
limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible
under the law or practices applicable or prevailing
at the time of the connection.
12-35
b. A person is considered to be in violation of this
chapter if the person connects a line conveying
sewage to the storm drain system, or allows such
connection to continue.
C. The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this ordinance.
a. The owner or party responsible shall allow the City
ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law. Any
temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the area to be inspected or sampled shall
be promptly removed by the discharger at the request
of the City and shall not be replaced.
b. If the enforcement officer has been refused access
to any part of the premises from which the nuisance
is occurring, and the enforcement officer is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may
be a violation of this section, or that there is a
need to inspect, test, examine or sample as part of
a routine program designed to verify compliance with
this section or any order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the City may seek
issuance of an administrative search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
c. The City may require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment or other such devices as are
necessary in the opinion of the City to conduct
monitoring or sampling of the premises stormwater
discharge. The monitoring equipment must be
maintained by the discharger in a safe and proper
operating condition at all times. All devices used
to measure stormwater flow and quality must be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
D. Upon finding that a person has violated a prohibition of
this section, the City may order compliance by written
notice of violation to the responsible person. Such
notice may require without limitation:
12-36
a. The performance of monitoring, analysis, and
reporting;
b. The elimination of illicit connections or illicit
discharges;
c. The violating discharges, practices, or operations
must cease and desist;
d. The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution
or contamination of hazards and the restoration of
any affected premises;
e. Payment of a fine to cover administrative and
remediation costs; and
f. The implementation of source control or treatment
BMPs.
Subd. 3. Good Housekeeping Provisions. Any owner or
occupant of property within Alexandria shall comply with the
following good housekeeping requirements:
A. No person shall leave, deposit, discharge, dump, or
otherwise expose any chemical or septic waste in an
area where discharge to streets or storm drain system
may occur. This section shall apply to both actual and
potential discharges.
B. For pools, water should be allowed to sit seven days
to allow for chlorine to evaporate before discharge.
If fungicides have been used, water must be tested and
approved for discharge to the wastewater treatment
plant.
C. Runoff of water from residential property shall be
minimized to the maximum extent practicable. Runoff
of water from the washing down of paved areas in
commercial or industrial property is prohibited unless
necessary for health or safety purposes and not in
violation of any other provisions in City codes.
D. Every person owning or occupying premises through which
a watercourse passes, shall keep and maintain that part
of the watercourse within the premises free of trash,
debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that
would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the
flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the
owner or occupant shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
12-37
Subd. 4. Storage of Materials, Machinery, and Equipment.
Objects, such as motor vehicle parts, containing grease, oil
or other hazardous substances, and unsealed receptacles
containing hazardous materials, shall not be stored in areas
susceptible to runoff. Any machinery or equipment that is to
be repaired or maintained in areas susceptible to runoff shall
be placed in a confined area to contain leaks, spills, or
discharges.
Subd. 5. Removal of Debris and Residue. Debris and
residue shall be removed and disposed of properly, as noted
below:
A. All motor vehicle parking lots shall be swept, at a
minimum of twice a year to remove debris. Such debris
shall be collected and disposed of properly. However,
parking lots are not required to be swept for one
month following a day on which precipitation of onehalf
inch or more occurs.
B. Fuel and chemical residue or other types of
potentially harmful material, such as animal waste,
garbage or batteries, which is located in an area
susceptible to runoff, shall be removed as soon as
possible and disposed of properly. Household hazardous
waste may be disposed of through community collection
program or at any other appropriate disposal site and
shall not be place in a trash container.
Subd. 6. Notification of Spills.
A. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as
any person responsible for a facility or operation or
responsible for emergency response for a facility or
operation has information of any known or suspected
release of materials which are resulting or may result
in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into
stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the
state, said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials, said person must immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services (911). In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the
City no later than the next business day. Notifications
12-38
in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the City within three
business days of the personal or phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials originates from an
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written
record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records must be retained for at
least three years.
Section 12.14 Severability. The provisions of this Ordinance
are severable, and if any provisions of this Ordinance, or
application of any provision of this Ordinance to any
circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such
provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of this
Ordinance must not be affected thereby.
Section 12.15 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not
intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where
this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of
this Ordinance shall prevail. All other Ordinances
inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
Section 12.16 Enforcement. The City shall be responsible for
enforcing this Ordinance.
Section 12.17 Penalties.
A. Any person found to be violating any provision of this
ordinance shall be served by the City with written
notice stating the nature of the violation and providing
a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction
thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time
stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
B. In the event that the owner fails to correct the
situation within the given time period, the City may
correct it and collect all such costs together with
reasonable attorney fees, or in the alternative, by
certifying said costs of correction as any other special
assessment upon the land from which said correction of
said violation was made.
C. Any person, firm, or corporation failing to comply with
or violating any of these regulations, shall be deemed
12-39
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine or
imprisonment or both. All land use and building permits
must be suspended until the applicant has corrected the
violation. Each day that separate violation exists shall
constitute a separate offense.

CHAPTER 13
LIST OF UNCODED ORDINANCES IN EFFECT
All ordinances described in this Chapter remain in effect
after adoption of the City Code. However, they are of a permanent
and continuing nature as authority for a certain specific act,
which has been performed. These ordinances have one thing in
common that generally distinguishes them from other provisions of
the City Code - - their texts have no continuing reference value.
For this reason, it appears justified to list and refer to them
