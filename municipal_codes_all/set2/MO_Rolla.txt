This commission shall be known as the "Tax Increment Financing Commission of Rolla, Missouri" (the "TIF Commission"). (Ord. 3548, §1; Ord. 3765, §1)

Authority of TIF Commission. The Commission shall serve as an advisory board to the City as it relates to the consideration of tax increment financing proposals submitted by interested parties or initiated by any public agency in accordance with the Act. The City Council hereby authorizes and approves the exercise by the TIF Commission of only those powers that are required by the Act to be exercised by the TIF Commission, as follows:

Each request for proposals shall state the primary objectives of the proposed redevelopment area or redevelopment project.

Each request for proposals shall provide reasonable opportunity for any person to submit alternative proposals or bids.

Each request for proposals shall be mailed to those persons or firms which the City determines might be interested in submitting a bid, and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.

Each proposal must demonstrate that "but for" the use of tax increment financing, the project is not feasible and would not be completed.

Criteria for the selection of proposals will include the impact of the proposed project on the City and other taxing jurisdictions, including the projected term for which tax increment financing will be utilized.

Article VIII - Sunshine Law
Sec. 2-251. Custodian of records designated.
The City Clerk is hereby designated as the "Custodian of Records" for the City of Rolla and such Custodian is located in Rolla City Hall, 901 North Elm Street, Rolla, Missouri 65401. Such designation does not mean that the City Clerk will necessarily have all the records in his or her possession, but simply is an indication to whom requests for copies of records and information regarding the City government shall be directed. Requests for records made to persons other than the City Clerk shall not be considered to be requests that are made pursuant to the Missouri Sunshine Law, Chapter 610 of the State Statutes. Nonetheless, any official or employee of the City who receives a request is directed to inform the City Clerk of the request in a timely fashion, so that a response may be made to the request. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-252. How records are requested.
All requests for records, notices, or information should be in writing and should be accompanied by a deposit of the estimated costs of reproducing the requested information. Oral requests, if received by the City Clerk, shall be immediately recorded in written form to document the same. Any request received by the City Clerk shall be initialed by the clerk, with the date and time of receipt noted. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-253. Response desired to be noted on request.
The requesting party shall indicate on the request the manner in which a response is desired. In absence of instructions to the contrary, it will be assumed that the requesting party wants to receive a response in the same form as the original request. (Example, if someone stops by City Hall and requests copies of documents, it will be assumed that the requesting party will stop by City Hall later to pick up the documents. But if someone mails a request to the City Hall, it will be assumed that a mailed response is desired). (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-254. Response within 3 business days.
The Custodian of Records shall respond to the request within three (3) business days of its receipt. A "business day" is a day when the City Hall is open for the conduct of City business during its normal business hours. While it is desirable that the entire transaction be completed within three (3) business days, there may be circumstances where clarification or explanation of the request is necessary, or where it may be necessary to provide only part of the requested information while searches are made to find copies of other documents requested. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-255. Documentation of response.
The Custodian of Records shall document the response provided either by (1) making an extra copy of the response and attaching it to the original request, (2) noting on the request what documents were provided, or (3) keeping a copy of any letter or note requesting additional information in order to process the request. Additionally, the Custodian of Records shall maintain a log to determine if requests are completed timely and all requests are adequately filled, Necessary information includes, but is not limited to, the date of request, a brief description of the request, the date the request is completed or why the request cannot be completed, and any associated costs of filling the request. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-256. Request for searches.
A request for copies of "all documents" or "every document" of a particular sort involves a request to search through every record of the City in order for the City to certify that it has provided "all" or "every" document. Such searches are expensive. Similarly, a request for records compiled in a format differing from the format in which the records are customarily retained is a request for a search and compilation, and can be expensive. As a general rule, the Custodian of Records is not expected to engage in extensive searches or compilations. Any search request that will require more than 15 minutes of the Custodians time will be refused without a reasonable advance deposit for the estimated time required to search for the records. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-257. Fees for retrieval and copies.
Fees for search, retrieval, accompanying and returning to their proper storage all City documents shall be:

For a search of 15 minutes or less  no retrieval fee.

For a search, retrieval, accompanying, and return of documents requiring more than 15 minutes  may be charged the actual cost of research time.

Fees for copies of documents shall be:

For copies that can be made on the Citys copy machine or other equipment available at City Hall  10 cents per side of page.

For copies that must be made elsewhere or copies that require significant time (15 minutes or more)  the actual charges imposed.
(Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-258. Inspection of records.
To reduce the cost to both the requesting party and the City, the Custodian of Records may permit a physical inspection of the records by the requesting party to help specify what documents are needed. The Custodian may impose such security as is deemed appropriate to guarantee that no record is removed from the City files. The requesting party shall pay the cost of that security at the rate provided in Section 2-257. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-259. Waiver of fees.
The Custodian of Records is empowered to waive the collection of any of the fees totaling less than $1 provided in Section 2-257 above to any citizen of the City requesting documents from the City, or to any representative of the news media that routinely sends a reporter to cover meetings of the City Council. No person or organization shall receive more than three (3) such waivers in any 12-month period. The fees may be waived if they contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. Any request for documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge by the City Council. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-260. Closed records and votes.
All records of the City which are permitted to be closed records by reason of the Sunshine Law or by any other statute of Missouri, or by any statute or regulation of the United States government shall be maintained as closed records. No such closed record shall be released to any person who is not a part of the City government, except that the Citys auditor may see such records as are reasonably necessary to prepare an audit report as requested by the City, and the Citys attorney may see such records as are reasonably necessary to represent the City. Requests that closed records be opened to the public inspection will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the City Council. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-261. Subpoenas for closed records.
No subpoena for a closed record shall be honored. All such subpoenas shall be referred to the City attorney for a response, and for a motion to quash the subpoena. The only exception to this requirement that will be recognized is a subpoena from a grand jury. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-262. Public notice board.
The Custodian of Records shall establish a fixed place where all public notices and agendas will be posted. This notice board should be in a place that is accessible to members of the public at times when the City Hall is open and (if possible) should be lighted and available for public inspection even at times when the City Hall is closed. This notice board shall have the notion "PUBLIC NOTICES" printed in letters at least four inches in height at the top of said board. A window or glass door at the entrance to the city Hall may be used as the notice board, provided such notices are placed in such a fashion that they can be read by persons on the outside of the City Hall. (Ord. 3943, §1)



Sec. 2-263. Penalty for disclosure of closed records.
Any person employed or working for the City, or who has been entrusted with a record that is marked to indicate that it is "confidential" or a "closed record," or who has been invited to participate in a closed meeting who nonetheless discloses any closed record, or any information about the contents of any closed meeting to any person shall be guilty of an offense under the ordinances of the City, and upon conviction therefore may be punished as provided by law. Any such person who is employed or working for the City may also be subject to the termination of their employment as a result of such disclosure. Any such person who is an elected official may also be subject to impeachment from their office as a result of such disclosure. (Ord. 3943, §1)

Sec. 6-30. Abatement Administration upon Hearing.
The following provisions set forth the procedures for abatement or removal of violations of the Unsafe Buildings Code upon hearing held as aforesaid:

Abatement. If an unsafe building condition is found to exist upon the required hearing, the Administrator shall proceed to cause the condition which constitutes a violation hereunder to be abated or removed in compliance with any orders made by the Hearing Board; provided that if the estimated cost of the abatement or removal exceeds $1,000.00, the Administrator shall not proceed until he/she has obtained the consent of the City Council to incur the cost of abatement or removal. If presented to the City Council, it may direct the Administrator to pursue alternative relief, such as prosecution or injunctive relief, to cause abatement of the nuisance, any orders issued by the Hearing Board to the contrary notwithstanding. The City shall not enter upon the property to commence abatement activities except upon the express written consent of the owner of said property or under the specific authority granted pursuant to a lawful warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction as provided herein.

Emergency measures. In cases where it reasonably appears that there is an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of any person, the Administrator may take emergency measures to vacate, repair, board up or demolish an unsafe building, provided that written notice shall be given to the owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee, agent and all other persons having an interest in such building or structure as promptly as possible, even if only after the emergency measures are taken. The cost of any such emergency work shall be collected in the same manner as herein provided. Unless serious bodily injury or death is likely to occur without emergency action, the City shall not enter upon the property to commence emergency measures except upon the express written consent of the owner of said property or under the specific authority granted pursuant to a lawful warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction as provided herein.

Securing Buildings. In all cases where a building does not meet the standards for unsafe buildings as set forth in section 6-28, but which constitutes a nuisance to the general public because it is vacant and open to unauthorized entry, the Administrator may notify the owner to secure the building within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event the owner fails to secure the building within that time, the Administrator may take whatever measures are necessary to secure the building. The cost of such measures shall be recovered in the same manner as herein set forth.

Standards for Securing Buildings. The following are the standards to be met when a building is secured as provided in Section 6-30(c):

All doors and other openings other than windows shall be securely locked, boarded, barricaded or otherwise secured.

All windows shall be locked or otherwise secured by the installation of security screens or grills. No windows shall be secured by covering them with boards or planks of wood or similar material, except as may be provided herein.

In the event that a vacant building should pose a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, the Administrator shall order the building to be boarded up on all sides with the cost of such work to be the responsibility of the owner of the building. The building shall be secured by the application of one half-inch thick exterior grade plywood. Such plywood shall be painted with a neutral color to match the building.

In the event a building is damaged by fire, tornado or other such catastrophe, the owner of the damaged building may board the windows thereof for a period not to exceed six (6) weeks.

Assessment of Abatement Costs. If the abatement is performed by City employees, the cost of the abatement shall be calculated according to the schedule of costs promulgated by the Administrator and kept on file in the office of the City Clerk. This schedule is to be determined after an analysis by the Administrator and other officers and department heads of the City deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine an accurate estimation of the costs incurred by the City to abate conditions subject to the provisions hereof. If the abatement or removal is performed by independent contractors hired by the City, the costs charged for the abatement or removal will be the actual amount paid to the contractor for the abatement or removal performed. Any and all direct fees and costs, including, but not limited to, landfill fees, hearing costs, and publication fees shall be included in the cost hereof.

Tax Bills for Work; Manner of Payment. Whenever the City shall have caused abatement or removal work to be performed as provided hereunder, the Administrator shall certify the cost of the work to the City Clerk who shall cause the certified costs to be included in a special tax bill to be issued against the property from which the condition was removed or added to the annual real estate tax bill for said property, at the City Clerk's option. Said certified costs shall be collected by the County Collector or other officials designated by the City to collect real property taxes. If the certified costs are not paid, the tax bill shall be considered delinquent. The collection of the delinquent bill shall be governed by the laws governing delinquent and back taxes. The special tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the owner of the property, and in addition shall be a lien on property until paid. Any tax bill hereunder shall bear interest at a rate of nine percent (9%) per annum until paid.

Enforcement of Tax Bills. Tax bills issued under this Code shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the bill, the doing of the work and the liability of the property and owner thereof for the charges stated in the bill and may be collected, if default should occur, by enforcement of the City's tax lien in accordance with State law, and/or by suit brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the City Counselor or by an attorney contracted with for the purpose on behalf of the City. Judgment in any such suit shall be satisfied by any means authorized by statutes or rules of court of the State.

Warrant Application. Any warrant to enter upon property when required hereunder for the purpose of inspection of property, emergency measures, or for the purpose of initiating abatement activities shall be applied for by written affidavit of the Administrator to either the Municipal or Associate Division of the Circuit of Phelps County, Missouri. Such affidavit shall set forth (i) the legal description of the property for which the warrant is applied, (ii) the name and address of the owner of the property, (iii) specific facts constituting probable cause that an unsafe building as defined by this Code exists for which entry is required or that the existence of an unsafe building has been determined upon full and adequate hearing as herein required, and (iv) that entry upon the property is necessary to fully investigate the nature and extent of the unsafe conditions, or to take emergency measures, or to abate said unsafe conditions upon order of the Hearing Board where the owner of the property has failed to comply with such order. (Ord. 4008, §1)

Sec. 6-49. Cross-connection control
I. CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL - GENERAL POLICY.
Purpose: The purpose of this Ordinance is:

To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or pollution by containing within the consumer's internal distribution system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public potable water supply system.

To promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial process systems.

To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.

Application: This Ordinance shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water system of the City of Rolla.

Policy: This Ordinance will be reasonably interpreted by the water supplier. It is the water supplier's intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.

The water supplier shall be primarily responsible for protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to backflow or contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement and maintain the program to control cross connections. The water supplier and consumer are jointly responsible for preventing contamination of the water system.

If, in the judgment of the water supplier or his authorized representative, cross connection protection is required through either piping modification or installation of an approved backflow prevention device, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall immediately comply by providing the required protection at his own expense; and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such protection has been provided.

If, in the opinion of the water supplier or his authorized representative, a real and serious threat to public health is posed, the water supplier may discontinue service without notice.
II. DEFINITIONS
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this Ordinance:

Air gap separation - means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the overflow level rim of the receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically.

Approved - means that a backflow prevention device or method has been accepted by the water supplier as defined by Missouri Department of Natural Resources as suitable for the proposed use.

Auxiliary water supply - means any water source or system, other than the public water supply, that may be available in the building or premises.

Backflow - means the flow other than the intended direction of flow, or any foreign liquids, gases, or substances into the distribution system of a public water supply.

Backflow prevention device - means any device, method or type of construction intended to prevent backflow into a potable water system.

Consumer - means protection of the public water supply by installing a cross connection control device or air gap separation on the main service line to a facility.

Consumer's water system - is any water system, supplied by or connected to a public water system, from the point where it taps into the main supply line to the user's facilities. A household plumbing system is considered a consumer's water system.

Containment - means protection of the public water supply by installing a cross connection control device or air gap separation on the main service line to a facility.

Contamination - means an impairment of the quality of the water by sewage, process fluids, or other wastes to a degree which could create an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through spread of disease by exposure.

Cross connection - is a physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate piping systems; one of which contains potable water, the other a nonpotable fluid, or water or unknown quality, where there could be flow from one system to the other, the direction depending on the pressure differential between the two. Cross connections may be considered as direct or indirect. A direct connection is where the potable water system is physically joined to a system containing unsafe water, sewage, or other waste that could contaminate the safe water system. An indirect cross connection is a condition where a source of contaminated water may be blown across, sucked, or diverted into the potable system.

Hazard, degree of - means an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.

Hazard, health - Any condition, device or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create or may create a danger to the health and well being of the water consumer.

Hazard, plumbing - a plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air gap separation or backflow prevention device.

Hazard, pollutional - an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.

Hazard, system - an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system, or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.

Industrial process system - means any system containing a fluid or solution, which may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional, or plumbing hazard if introduced into a potable water supply.

Interchangeable connection - is an arrangement or device that will allow alternate but not simultaneous use of two sources of water.

Isolation - means protection of a facility service line by installing a cross connection control device or air gap separation on an individual fixture, appurtenance, or system.

Pollution - means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use.

Public potable water system - means any publicly or privately owned water system supplying water to the general public which is satisfactory for drinking, culinary, and domestic purposes and meets the requirements of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device - is a device that contains a minimum of two independently acting check valves with an automatically operated pressure differential relief valve between the two check valves. During normal flow and at the cessation of normal flow, the pressure between these two checks is less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, maintains the pressure between the check valves at less than the supply pressure. The unit includes tightly closing shut-off valves at each end of the device, and each device is fitted with test cocks.

Service connection - means the terminal end of a service line from the public water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service, then the service connection means the downstream end of the meter.

Water supplier - means Rolla Municipal Utilities.

III. CROSS-CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
No water service connection shall be installed or maintained to any premises where actual or potential cross connections to the public potable or consumer's water system may exist unless such actual or potential cross connections are abated or controlled to the satisfaction of the water supplier and as required by the laws and regulations of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Connection shall be installed or maintained, whereby an auxiliary water supply may enter a public potable or consumer's water system unless such auxiliary water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the water supplier and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

No water service connection shall be installed or maintained to any premises in which the plumbing system, facilities, and fixtures have not been constructed and installed using acceptable plumbing practices considered by the water supplier as necessary for the protection of health and safety.
IV. SURVEY AND INVESTIGATIONS
The consumer's premises shall be open at all reasonable times to the water supplier, or his authorized representative, for the conduction of surveys and investigations of water use practices within the consumer's premises to determine whether there are actual or potential cross connections to the consumer's water system through which contaminants or pollutants could backflow into the public potable water systems.

On request by the water supplier or his authorized representative, the consumer shall furnish information on water use practices within his premises.

It shall be the responsibility of the water consumer to conduct periodic surveys of water use practices on his premises to determine whether there are actual or potential cross connections to his water system through which contaminants or pollutants could backflow into his or the public potable water system.
V. TYPE OF PROTECTION REQUIRED
The type of protection required by this Ordinance shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists, as follows:

An approved air gap separation shall be installed where the public potable water system may be contaminated with substances that could cause severe health hazard.

An approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed where the public potable water system may be contaminated with a substance that could cause a system or health hazard.

An approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device or an approved double check valve assembly shall be installed where the public potable water system may be polluted with substances that could cause a pollutional hazard not dangerous to health.
VI. WHERE PROTECTION IS REQUIRED
An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each service line to a consumer's water system serving premises where, in the judgment of the water purveyor or the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, actual or potential hazards to the public potable water system exist. The type and degree of protection required shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.

An approved air gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed at the service connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the water supplier or the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the nature and extent of activities on the premises, or the materials used in connection with the activities, or materials stored on the premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross-connection occur, even though such cross-connection may not exist at the time the backflow prevention device is required to be installed. This includes but is not limited to the following situations:

Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the auxiliary supply is acceptable to the water supplier and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross-connections exist.

Premises where entry is restricted so that inspection for cross connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure the cross connections do not exist.

Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being established or reestablished.

Premises, which due to the nature of the enterprise therein, are subject to recurring modification or expansion.

Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross connection could reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.

Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled such that if backsiphonage or back pressure should occur, a serious health hazard may result.

The following types of facilities fall into one or more of the categories of premi ses where an approved air gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device is required by the water supplier and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to protect the public water supply and must be installed at these facilities unless all hazardous or potentially hazardous conditions have been eliminated or corrected by other methods to the satisfaction of the water supplier and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

(b) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;

(c) Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;

(d) Prohibit illicit connections and illegal discharges to the municipal storm sewer system;

(e) Provide for the protection of stream systems through the establishment of stream buffers;

(f) Minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. (Ord. 2517; Ord. 3500, §2)

Article III - Erosion and Sediment Control
Sec. 15-38. Introduction.
During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. (Ord. 3500, §2)

Article V - Stream Buffers
Sec. 15-73. Introduction.
Buffers adjacent to stream systems provide numerous environmental protection and resource management benefits that can include the following:

(a) Restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the water resources by removing pollutants delivered from urban stormwater, reducing erosion and sediment entering the stream, and stabilizing stream banks;

(b) Providing infiltration of stormwater runoff;

(c) Maintaining base flow of streams;

(d) Contributing the organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem;

(e) Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic organisms;

(f) Providing riparian wildlife habitat;

(g) Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity.

It is the desire of the City of Rolla to protect and maintain the native vegetation in riparian and wetland areas by implementing specifications for the establishment, protection, and maintenance of vegetation along all stream systems within our jurisdictional authority. (Ord. 3500, §2)

Article VI - Flood Control
Sec. 15-92. Introduction.
The flood hazard areas of the City of Rolla are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps.

Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation.  The base flood selected for this Chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this Chapter.  It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the FIS, and illustrative materials for Phelps County, Missouri, dated February 20, 2008 as amended, and any future revisions thereto.

Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point. (Ord. 3500, §2; Ord. 3846, §1; Ord. 4093 §1)
(Return to Contents)



Sec. 15-93. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 15-92 to establish or maintain the Citys eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:

(a) To protect human life and health;

(b) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(c) To minimize the need for rescue efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(d) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;

(e) Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and

(f) Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

(g) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(h) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains;

(i) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(j) To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 3500, §2)

(f) Conditions for Approving Floodplain Management Variances:

(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot on one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b - f) below, have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places or the local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structures continued historic designation.

(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:

(A) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(B) A determination that failure to grant the variance could result in exceptional hardship to the developer; and

(C) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(6) The City shall notify the developer in writing, over the signature of the Public Works Director, that:

(A) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and

(B) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Chapter.

(g) Conditions of Approving Variances for Accessory Structures: Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's­ding's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Section 15-102 (e) and (f) of this Chapter.

In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed:

(1) Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in zone A only as identified on the City's FIRM.

(2) For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with Section 15-102 (d) (2) of this Chapter.

(3) The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Section 15-102(d1) of this Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.

If such permission is not denied 30 days, Grantee may proceed as proposed.

Duration. The term of said franchise and all rights, privileges, obligations and restrictions pertaining thereto shall be fifteen (15) years from the effective date of the franchise unless abridged or terminated as hereinafter provided. The effective date of the franchise award ordinance shall be upon final passage by the Council unless a Grantee fails to file within twenty (20) days after the date of notification of final passage in the appropriate office of the City a written acceptance of the franchise, in which event it shall be null and void.

Franchise Nonexclusive. Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a Cable Communications System as it deems appropriate. However, the terms of any franchise award ordinance or license granted to any other grantee shall not be more favorable than any other franchise award ordinance. The effect of this provision is to require nondiscrimination by the City in relation to multiple grantees.

Transfer of Ownership or Control.

Transfer of Franchise. Any franchise cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or otherwise disposed of in any manner, including but not limited to, forced or voluntary sales, merger, consolidation, receivership, or other means, without the prior written consent of the City. Such consent as required by the City shall, however, not be unreasonably withheld.

The successor Grantee, upon any transfer as heretofore described, shall within sixty (60) days thereafter file with the City an instrument duly executed and certified reciting the fact of such sale assignment or lease, accepting the terms of this franchise ordinance and the franchise award ordinance subject to the terms of the transaction and agreeing to perform all the terms thereof.

Every such transfer as heretofore described, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be deemed void and of no effect unless Grantee shall within sixty (60) days after the same shall have been made, file such certified copy as is required.

Ownership or Control. The Grantee shall promptly notify the City of any actual transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of Grantee. A rebuttable presumption that a change, transfer or acquisition of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by a person or group of persons of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the voting shares of Grantee.

For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and Grantee shall assist the City in any such inquiry.

Mortgage of Assets, When Allowed. Grantee shall not make, execute, or enter into any deed, deed of trust, mortgage, conditional sales contract, or any loan, lease, pledge, sale, gift or similar agreement concerning any of the facilities and property, real or personal, involved in the operation of the Cable System under a franchise award ordinance granted by the City except:

disposition or replacement of worn out or obsolete equipment, property or facilities in the normal course of operating a Cable System, including the renewal or extension of equipment or property leases and contracts; or

acquisition, transfer, sale or other disposition of leases, licenses, easements, and other interests in real property in the normal course of operating a Cable System and not involving the relinquishment of any right or power affecting Grantee's ability to provide services in whole or in part; or

with prior approval of the City based on a finding that the proposed transaction will not affect Grantee's ability and responsibility to provide services in accordance with its franchise award ordinance and will not interfere with the City's interest. Such approval by the City shall not unreasonably be withheld; or

Grantee may pledge or mortgage its assets to a financial institution in return for sums necessary to construct, buy, or operate the Cable System, provided that such pledge or mortgage and related agreements that are public records are filed with the City and limit such financial institution as follows: any foreclosure or exercise of lien over the franchise or facilities may only be by assumption of control over the entire system or a self-sufficient, separately operable head-end and its dependent distribution system in a multiple head-end system. However, if the financial institution providing financing shall notify the Grantor of its intent not to operate the System, then the City shall have the option to operate said System. Prior to assumption of control, the financial institution shall notify the City that it or a designee acceptable to the City will take control of and operate the System, and shall submit a plan for such operation insuring continued service and compliance with this Ordinance and all franchise award ordinance obligations during the term the financial institution exercises such control. The institution shall not exercise control for longer than one (1) year unless extended by the City for cause and shall be entitled to petition the City for transfer of the remaining term of the franchise award ordinance or award of a new franchise to another Grantee. The City shall approve such transfer upon finding that the legal, financial, character, technical and other qualities of the proposed Grantee are satisfactory and that the transfer will promote the public interest. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Before the City shall operate the System, it shall likewise provide a written plan of operation to the financial institution. Upon provision of a written plan, the City shall have the authority to take possession of said System and operate said System. The City shall, in the course of its operations, collect all billings and pay all appropriate bills and expenses, and deduct and place the rest of said funds from operating revenues of the System in an escrow account in said financial institution. The escrow funds shall be released when the City is relieved of the responsibility of operating the System.

Consent Not Waiver. The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of said franchise award ordinance.

Nonapproval of Transfer, When. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the City will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of any proposed system.

Franchise Renewal. This franchise may be renewed upon application of Grantee pursuant to the following procedures and/or in accordance with the then applicable law.

Renewal Notice. At least twenty-four (24) months prior to the expiration of the franchise award ordinance, Grantee shall inform the City in writing of its intent to seek renewal of the franchise award ordinance, or as shall be required by Federal or State law, if said laws existing at that time pre-empt, as a matter of law, this Ordinance.

Satisfactory Performance Required. After giving public notice, the City shall proceed to determine whether Grantee has satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise award ordinance. To determine satisfactory performance, the City shall consider technical developments and performance of the System requirements set in the franchise award ordinance, as well as other standards established in applicable law - Federal or State. Programming, or other services offered, and costs of services offered shall also be considered if then allowed by applicable law. Also, the City shall consider Grantee's annual reports made to the City and the FCC; industry performance on a national basis shall also be considered. Provision shall be made for public comment.

Time Frame. A one (1) year period shall be provided to determine the Grantee's eligibility for renewal.

Renewal Periods. If the City finds Grantee's performance satisfactory, a new franchise award ordinance shall be granted pursuant to this Ordinance, as amended, for an additional period of five (5) years. Subsequent renewals for five (5) year periods may be applied for by Grantee in accordance with the procedure outlined in this Section. At the discretion of the City, longer periods of renewal may be granted.

Police Powers. In accepting this franchise, Grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such power.

Any conflict between the provisions of this Ordinance and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to Grantee or Cable Communications Systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this Ordinance shall prevail only if the City finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law.

Franchise Fee.

Annual Franchise Payment. A grantee of a franchise award ordinance hereunder shall pay to the City a fee in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts for all subscription services if allowed by law.

Such payment shall be in addition to any other fee or tax and commence as of the effective date of the operation of the System by Grantee. In the event of a dispute as to the amount due the City, if the City so requests, Grantee shall furnish a statement of said payment certified by the financial officer of Grantee, which statement shall include total amounts of annual gross subscription service revenues and the above charges, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment. If Grantee fails to produce a certified statement acceptable to the City, then, the City shall choose a CPA of at least regional reputation for honesty and competency. All reasonable charges for the said CPA services shall be borne by Grantee if the annual Gross Revenues reported to Grantor are, in the aggregate, 2% or less than reported.
Acceptance by City. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this Ordinance or for the performance of any other obligation of Grantee.

Failure to Make Required Payment. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, Grantee shall pay as additional compensation:

an interest charge, computed from such due date on such amount due, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate in effect from time to time at Boatmen's National Bank, Rolla, Missouri during such period until such amounts are fully paid, and

a sum of money equal to expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees, if any, incurred by the City by reason of delinquent payment.

Conflict of Laws. Should it be adjudged or determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction that the amount of said franchise fee as set out herein is in conflict with State or Federal law or FCC Rules and Regulations, then the amount set by this Ordinance shall be the maximum allowable under controlling law.

Forfeiture, Revocation or Abridgement.

Grounds for Revocation or Abridgment. The City reserves the right to revoke any franchise award ordinance granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise award ordinance in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under this Ordinance and the franchise award ordinance grant:

If Grantee should default in the performance of any of its material obligations under this Ordinance or under such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the City and Grantee.

If Grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect, the liability insurance coverage as required herein.

If Grantee should frequently violate any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over Grantee relative to this franchise unless such orders or rulings are being contested by Grantee in a court of competent jurisdiction.

If Grantee ceases to provide services for any reason within the control of Grantee over the Cable Communications System. Grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this ordinance in any case in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond Grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond Grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in which Grantee holds a controlling interest or which holds, alone or with others a controlling interest in Grantee, whether held directly or indirectly.

If Grantee evades or attempts to evade any of the provisions of this Ordinance or the franchise award ordinance or practices any fraud or deceit upon the City.

If Grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt.

Procedure prior to Revocation. Revocation procedures shall be executed as required by the then applicable laws. If neither Federal nor State law preempts, the following shall apply:

The City may make written demand that Grantee comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of Grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand, the City may place its request for termination of the franchise award ordinance upon a regular Council meeting agenda. The City shall cause to be served upon such Grantee, at least ten (10) business days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the City Clerk at least once ten (10) business days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the City.

The Council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any alleged failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee was with just cause.

If such failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee was with just cause, the Council shall direct Grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.

If the Council shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee was without just cause, then the Council may, by resolution, declare that the franchise award ordinance of such Grantee shall be terminated unless there be compliance by Grantee within such period as the Council may fix.

Abridgement of Franchise Term. After following the procedure set out herein prior to revocation, and the Council finding a violation of this franchise or the franchise award ordinance, but not of sufficient gravity to require revocation of this franchise or the franchise award ordinance, or if the Council determines that revocation would not serve the public health, safety and welfare, the Council may abridge the term of the franchise award ordinance. For each offense or violation the Council may abridge the term of the franchise award ordinance for a period of time not more than 60 days. Each day's violation of this section may be considered a separate offense. Such abridgments of the franchise award ordinance term shall not in any event accumulate in the aggregate more than four (4) years total.

Disposition of Facilities. In the event a franchise award ordinance expires, is revoked or otherwise terminated, the City may order the removal of the system facilities from the City within a reasonable period of time as determined by the City.

Restoration of Property.

The City shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places; and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability insurance as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by Grantee with the terms and conditions of this paragraph and this ordinance.

Restoration by City, Reimbursements of Costs. In the event of a failure by Grantee to complete any work required by subsection (d) above and/or subsection (e) above, or any other work required by City law or ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the City, the City may cause such work to be done and Grantee shall reimburse the City the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the City may recover such costs.

Any franchise award ordinance granted shall at the option of the City Council, cease and terminate one hundred eighty (180) days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of Grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred eighty (180) days, or unless:

Such receiver or trustee shall have, within one hundred eighty (180) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this ordinance and the franchise award ordinance granted pursuant hereto, and the receiver or trustee within said one hundred eighty (180) days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise award ordinance; and

Upon receipt of such notification, the Grantor shall determine if a material provision of the franchise award ordinance is affected. Upon such determination, the Grantor shall have the right to modify or amend any of the sections of the franchise award ordinance to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of the franchise award ordinance. The Grantor may terminate the franchise award ordinance in the event the Grantor determines that substantial and material compliance with the original proposed terms of the franchise award ordinance has been frustrated by such State or Federal requirement.

Franchise Agreement Subject to Other Laws. This Franchise Agreement is subject to and shall be governed by all terms, conditions and provisions of the Cable Ordinance as enacted and any applicable provision of federal, state, and local law. However, the Franchise Agreement will be the prevailing document in the event of conflicts or inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Citys Cable Ordinance.

No Waiver:

The failure of the City on one or more occasions to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under this Franchise Agreement, the Cable Ordinance or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance by the Franchisee, unless such right or such compliance or performance has been specifically waived in writing.

Waiver of a breach of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of any other breach, whether similar to or different from that waived.

Construction of Franchise Agreement: The provisions of this Franchise Agreement shall be liberally construed in accordance with generally accepted rules of contract construction and to promote the public interest.

Periodic Review:

The City shall conduct a review of the Cable System during the six-month period that begins thirty-six (36) months prior to the expiration date of this Agreement. Such review shall be completed during such six-month period, and in sufficient time to allow the City to exercise its options hereunder. Such review shall be conducted to enable the City to determine the needs of the community and whether they are being met by the Cable System. The determination under this paragraph shall be based upon the reasonable cable-related needs and interests of the community, considering all relevant factors including the costs to the Franchisee of meeting those needs and interests.

To assist in the Citys review, the Franchisee shall submit a report to the City describing advances in cable technology nationwide, the results of any testing of such technology by Franchisee or its Affiliates, the potential benefits and disadvantages of those advances for the System and its Subscribers and potential Subscribers, and its plan and timetable for instituting any such advances in technology. Additionally, upon request by the City the Franchisee shall testify before the City or provide oral analysis of Franchisees review of the status of local cable competition.

The review may be conducted by City Council or by such person(s) as it may designate. The review may be conducted in conjunction with other franchise authorities. If the City Council designates reviewers, such reviewers shall provide a written report to the City Council in sufficient time to allow the City Council to exercise its options hereunder.

After conducting such a review, unless the provisions of subparagraph (5) apply, City may select one of the following courses of action:

After complying with the Cable Ordinance provisions on franchise modification, extend the term of this Agreement by a period of time no less than one year, and no more than four years, unless the Franchisee gives written notice that it object to such an extension. A written renewal notice from the Franchisee submitted during the aforesaid six-month period requesting commencement of a renewal proceeding under 47 USC section 546(a) shall not constitute an objection to extension unless it contains an express statement of such objection, but in the event of an extension, such renewal notice shall continue in effect through all additional extension cycles, In the event of such an extension, the City shall conduct another review of the Cable System pursuant to this subsection on a schedule based on the expiration date of this Agreement as extended. Such cycle of reviews and extensions may be repeated as often as deemed appropriate by the City subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Cable Ordinance. No extension shall affect the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. No extension shall require payment of renewal fees by the Franchisee.

Commence a franchise renewal proceeding under 47 USC section 546(a).

Conduct informal franchise renewal negotiations under 47 U.S.C. section 546(h).

Conclude the review process (except the City shall comply with the Cable Act if the Franchisee submits a timely written renewal notice that is not withdrawn).

This review process shall not override any remedies of the City, including but not limited to remedies of revocation. (Ord. 2832; Ord. 3823, §1)

Sec. 16-35. Regulation and Oversight.
Severability: In the event that a court or agency of competent jurisdiction declares by final decision that any provision of this Franchise Agreement is unenforceable according to its terms or is otherwise void, said provision shall be considered a separate, distinct and independent part of this Agreement, and such declaration shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions of this Agreement. Alternatively, the City may modify any such provisions to the reasonable extent necessary to make such provision enforceable if such modifications are consistent with the full intent and purposes of this Agreement.

Preemption: In the event that federal or state laws, rules or regulations preempt a provision or limit the enforceability of a provision of this Agreement, then, subject to the Citys rights under the foregoing subsection, the provision shall be read to be preempted to the extent and for the time, bur only to the extent and for the time, required by law. In the event such federal or state law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the provision hereof that had been preempted is no longer preempted, such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect, and shall thereafter be binding on the parties hereto, without the requirement of further action on the part of the City.

Notice: As soon as reasonably practicable following knowledge thereof, the Franchisee shall notify the City of any point of conflict believed to exist between the Cable Ordinance, this Agreement and any other provisions of law.

Failure Constitutes Material Violation. Failure to comply with the insurance requirements set forth in this Section shall constitute a material violation of the Franchise.

Indemnification:

Franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the City, its officials, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance, or operation of its Cable System; copyright infringements or a failure by the Franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by the Cable System; the conduct of the Franchisees business in the City; or in any way arising out of the granting of the Franchise or Franchisees enjoyment or exercise of this Franchise, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the Cable Ordinance or this Franchise Agreement.

Specifically, but not by way of limitation on the scope of (1) above, Franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, and in their capacity as such, the officers, agents, and employees thereof, from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments for damages or otherwise subject to Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. section 558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of the installation, construction, operation, or maintenance of its System, including but not limited to any claim against the Franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any Person, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark, or patent, or of any other similar right of any Person.

The indemnity provision includes, but is not limited to, the Citys reasonable attorneys fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or proceeding prior to Franchisee assuming such defense. The City shall notify Franchisee of claims and suits as soon as practicable, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve Franchisee of its obligations hereunder. Once Franchisee assumes such defense, the City may at its option continue to participate in the defense at its own expense.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the City shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts attributable to the Citys own negligence, willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, including in the performance of its obligations under the Cable Ordinance or this Franchise Agreement.

Sec. 16-41. Franchise Violations.
Procedures Notice and Cure.
In the event of an alleged violation of the franchise, the following procedures shall be followed.

The City shall send to the Franchisee, by certified mail, a notice of any alleged violation(s) or failure to meet any of the terms or provisions of this Ordinance that shall set forth a detailed description of any alleged violation(s).

The Franchisee shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such notice to respond in writing, stating its explanation for the alleged violation(s) and what actions, if any, have been or will be taken to cure the alleged violation(s) or lack of compliance.

The City may accept the Franchisees explanation and/or remedy proposed. Alternatively, if the City does not accept the Franchisees explanation or believes that the violation(s) will not be cured within a reasonable period of time, it may send to the Franchisee a Notice of Violation at any time after the initial thirty (30) day period has elapsed.

If a Notice of Violation is issued, a hearing shall be held by the City that shall afford the Franchisee due process and an opportunity to present evidence. The City shall thereafter issue a written report stating its conclusions and the reason therefore. The City may determine (a) that any alleged violation has been correct or is being corrected by the Franchisee and that no further action is required; (b) that an extension of the time or other appropriate relief should be granted; (c) that the problem is beyond the Franchisees direct control and that the Franchisee is therefore not at fault; or, that the Franchisee is in violation of its franchise and appropriate action will be taken by the City. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit or restrict the Franchisees right to appeal the Citys actions in state or federal court.

In the case of any alleged violation of federal, state or local technical standards or safety codes which do not pose a substantial safety hazard, the Franchisee shall be given reasonable time to complete any required modifications or repairs which may be needed and the City shall not assess any penalty against the Franchisee so long as the Franchisee shows that it is working promptly, diligently and in good faith to correct any alleged technical violations. A substantial safety hazard shall be defined as one posing an imminent likelihood of causing significant bodily injury if not repaired immediately.

Franchise Termination and Continuity of Service.

In the event of a formal denial of renewal or revocation of a franchise  which denial or revocation is upheld by final judicial determination, including final adjudication of any appeal(s) which may be filed  the Franchisee shall have a period of one (1) year from final adjudication, including any appeal, within which to transfer or convey the assets of the cable system. Approval of such proposed transfer or assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld by the City.

In the event the franchise term expires prior to formal action being taken by the City to renew the franchise or deny franchise renewal, the Franchisee shall continue to operate the cable system pursuant to the terms and conditions of its then existing franchise until the franchise is extended, renewed or denied pursuant to applicable federal law and the provisions of this franchise. The renewal procedures contained in Section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, shall be followed by the City and the Franchisee.

Either Franchisee or Franchisor may elect to terminate this Franchise on February 18, 2017 by giving the other party written notice at least 37 months prior to the termination date.

Force Majeure. In the event the Franchisee is prevented or delayed in the performance of any of its obligations under this Ordinance by reason of flood, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or other acts of God, unavoidable casualty, insurrections, war, riot, sabotage, vandalism, strikes, boycotts, lockouts, labor disputes, or omissions or delays by utility companies upon whom Franchisee is dependent for pole attachments or easement use, shall have a reasonable time under the circumstances to perform its obligations under this Ordinance or to procure a reasonable and comparable substitute for such obligations. Under such circumstances the Franchisee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions of the Ordinance nor shall it suffer any penalty relating thereto.

Effective Franchise Date. The effective date of the franchise shall be the date of final passage of this ordinance; provided that if Grantee does not file with the City Clerk within twenty (20) days after notification of final passage a written, signed and notarized acceptance of all terms and conditions of the franchise, the franchise shall be null and void.

The term of the franchise shall be fifteen (15) years from the effective date subject to the limitations herein, at which time it shall expire and be of no force and effect; provided, that the Grantor may renew the franchise in accordance with the provisions of Ordinance No. 2831, or then applicable law.

Franchise Fees. For any twelve (12) month period, the franchise fees to be paid to Grantor by Grantee shall be five percent (5%) of Grantee's gross subscriber service revenues derived in such period from the operation of the cable system. Grantee shall calculate the five percent (5%) and then add said franchise fee to the subscribers monthly bill as a separate line item designated "franchise fees payable to City". In the event that the FCC or other regulatory bodies mandate that the Company obtain and pay a fee for the right to rebroadcast the signals of commercial television or radio stations, the charge for such right, may, at the Company's sole option, be passed on to the subscriber on a pro rata basis and no Franchise Fee shall be charged on such passed through costs.

Grounds for revocation. Subject to the "Procedures Prior to Revocation" provided herein, City reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescinds all rights and privileges associated with the Franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under this Franchise:

If Grantee should fail to perform any of its material obligation under this Ordinance or under such documents, contracts, and other terms and provisions entered into by and between City and Grantee.

If Grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect, the liability coverage as required herein.

If within the distribution system, Grantee ceases to provide services mandated by the PSC for any reason within the reasonable control of Grantee, this action shall not prevent Grantee from discontinuing service for nonpayment, where residences or commercial establishments are vacant or have ceased to be operational, or any other reason permitted under Grantee's tariff on file with the PSC.

Grantee shall not be declared in default or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this Ordinance in any case in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond Grantee's control. A default shall not be deemed to be beyond Grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in which Grantee holds a controlling interest or which holds a controlling interest in Grantee, whether held directly or indirectly.

Procedure prior to revocation.

City shall make written demand in sufficient detail so that the complaint can be understood that Grantee must comply and to what extent Grantee must comply with any such requirement, limitation term, condition, rule or regulation, or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal, or neglect of Grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand, City may place its request for termination of the Franchise upon a regular Council meeting agenda. City shall cause to be served upon such Grantee, at least ten (10) business days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the City Clerk at least once ten (10) business days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the City.

The Council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee was with just cause.

If such failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee was with just cause, the Council shall direct Grantee to comply within such times and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.

If the Council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect by Grantee was without just cause, then the Council may, by resolution, declare that the Franchise of such Grantee shall be terminated unless there be compliance by the Grantee within such period as the Council may set.

Rental or leasing of equipment used specifically for the emergency action (e.g., protective equipment or clothing, scientific and technical equipment).

Article II - INDOOR SMOKE FREE AIR ACT OF 2011
Sec. 19-10.            Prohibition of Smoking in Indoor Workplaces and Public Places.
WHEREAS, this Article shall be known as the City of Rolla Indoor Smoke Free Air Act of 2011.

WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Rolla, Missouri does hereby find that: The 2006 U.S. Surgeon Generals Report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that (1) secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; (2) children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (4) there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; (5) establishing smokefree workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and (6) evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smokefree policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Office on Smoking and Health, 2006)

WHEREAS, the Public Health Services National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005)

WHEREAS, a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.)

WHEREAS, secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. (California Environmental Protection Agency [Dal EPA]), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) The Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act, "Nonsmokers Voice 15(1): 8-9.)

WHEREAS, given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the American society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smokefree environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure, and recommends that indoor environments be smokefree in their entirety. (Samet, J.; Bohanon, Jr., H.R.; Coultas, D.B.; Houston, T.P.; Persily, A.K.; Schoen, L.J.; Spengler, J.; Callaway, C.A., "ASHRAE position document on environmental tobacco smoke," American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), 2005.)

WHEREAS, hundreds of communities in the U.S., plus numerous states, including Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Utah and Washington, have enacted laws requiring all workplaces, restaurants, bars and other public places to be smokefree, as have numerous countries, including Bhutan, France, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Uruguay, and the United Kingdom constituent countries of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

WHEREAS, the smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a positive danger to health, and a material public nuisance.

WHEREAS, accordingly, the City Council of the City of Rolla, Missouri finds and declares that the purposes of this ordinance are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

ARTICLE I IN GENERAL
Sec. 29-1. Purpose and Findings.
(a) Purpose: It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate the display of explicit sexual material and sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Rolla, Missouri, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this Chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including explicit sexual materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to explicit sexual materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this Chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or offensive material of a sexual nature.

(b) Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities as outlined in numerous studies/reports generally available for consideration, and on findings incorporated in a series of cases as found and included herein by reference to the IML Model Ordinance on Sexually Oriented Business Regulation, the City Council finds that:

(1) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.

(2) Employees of certain sexually oriented businesses engage in higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments and that by offering or providing such locations may thereby create unhealthy conditions, unless properly regulated.

(3) At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infections (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.

(4) The number of cases of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases has been on the rise or remain at high levels in the United States.

(5) The findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns by establishing that sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the public interest and to address substantial governmental concerns.

(6) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is managed in a way consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the general public. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.

(7) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.

(8) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.

(9) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

(10) In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in conduct that this Chapter is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.

(11) The fact that an applicant for an adult use license as been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this Chapter.

(12) The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct that leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

(13) The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of Rolla, Missouri will be promoted by the enactment of this Chapter.

(a) Required. It shall be unlawful to operate a food service or retail food establishment within the city, or its police jurisdiction, without a valid operating permit issued by the health authority and a city of Rolla business license.

A valid operating permit and a copy of the most recent health inspection shall be conspicuously posted in every food service and retail food establishment.

Application forms are provided by the health authority and must be filled out completely and bear the signature of the applicant or applicants. For permit renewals, a previous years tax statement indicating annual gross food sales must be included. An application for a temporary food service or retail food establishment shall also include the dates of the proposed operation.

For new establishments, upon receipt of an application the health authority shall conduct an inspection of the proposed food service or retail food establishment to determine compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. When the health authority determines that the establishment meets applicable requirements of this Chapter, an operating permit will be issued to the applicant.

Operating permits are valid from July 1 through June 30 of the following year or from the date of issuance through June 30 of the current permit year. Operating permits for temporary food service establishments will be issued for a period not to exceed fourteen days. Permits are non-transferable.

(c) Suspension. Permits may be temporarily suspended or revoked by the health authority for failure of the holder to comply with the requirements of this Chapter. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Chapter, whenever the health authority finds unsanitary or other conditions in the operation of a food service or retail food establishment which, in their judgment, constitute a substantial hazard to the public health, they may without warning, notice or hearing, issue a written notice to the permit holder or operator citing such condition, specifying the corrective action to be taken, and specifying the time period within which such action shall be taken.

If deemed necessary, such order shall state that the establishments operating permit is immediately suspended or revoked, and all food service or retail food operations are to be immediately discontinued. Any person issued such an order shall comply immediately therewith, but upon written petition to the health authority, shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.

(d) Reinstatement. A person who has their operating permit suspended or revoked may, at any time, make application for a re-inspection of their establishment for the purpose of reinstatement of the operating permit. Within ten days following receipt of a written request, including a statement signed by the applicant that in his/her opinion the conditions causing suspension or revocation of the permit have been corrected, the health authority shall make a re-inspection. If the applicant is in compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, the operating permit shall be reinstated.

(e) Revocation. In cases of serious or repeated violations of the requirements of this Chapter, or interference with the health authority in the performance of their duties, an operating permit may be permanently revoked. Prior to such action, the health authority shall notify the permit holder in writing, specifying the reasons the operating permit is subject to revocation and advising them the permit will be permanently revoked five days following service of the notice unless a request for hearing is filed with the health authority, by the permit holder within the five day period. A permit may be suspended for cause pending its revocation or a hearing relative thereto.

(f) Hearings. The Rolla City Council shall conduct hearings provided for in this Section at a time and place designated by the council. Based upon the record of such hearing, the council shall make a finding and shall sustain, modify or rescind any official notice or order considered in the hearing.

(b) Access to establishments. The health authority, after proper identification, shall be permitted to enter, at any reasonable time, any food service or retail food establishment within the city, or its police jurisdiction, for the purpose of making inspections to determine compliance with this Chapter. They shall be permitted to examine all records of the establishment relevant to daily operations including food and supplies purchased, received or used, and persons employed.

(c) Issuance of notice. When the health authority conducts an inspection of a food service or retail food establishment and discovers requirements of Section 34-1 through 34-9 of this Chapter have been violated, they shall notify the operating permit holder or operator of such violations by means of an inspection report form or other written notice. In such notification, the health authority shall:

Specify the specific violations identified during the inspection.
Establish a specific and reasonable compliance schedule for correction of the identified violations.
Indicate in writing that failure to comply with the provisions of this Chapter or any notice issued pursuant to this Chapter may result in immediate suspension of the operating permit.
Indicate in writing that an opportunity for an appeal of any notice of inspection findings will be provided if a written request for a hearing is filed with the health authority within the period of time established in the inspection report.
(d) Service of notices. Notices provided for in this Section shall be deemed properly served when the original or copy of the notice has been delivered personally to the permit holder or person in charge, or has been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the permit holder. A copy of the notice shall be filed with the records of the health authority. (Ord. 3724, §1)

Sec. 34-6. Examination and condemnation of food.
Food may be examined or sampled by the health authority as often as deemed necessary to determine its condition. The health authority may, upon written notice to the owner or person in charge order the immediate denaturing and disposal of any food they determine to be, or have probable cause to believe is adulterated, misbranded or otherwise unwholesome. They may also place said products under a hold order pending further investigation or laboratory testing. Under a hold order, food shall be permitted to be suitably stored but not served, sold or provided to the public with or without charge. It shall also be unlawful for any person to remove or alter a hold order notice or tag placed on food by the health authority, and neither such food nor the containers thereof shall be relabeled, repacked, reprocessed, altered, transported, disposed of, or destroyed without permission of the health authority except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. After the owner or person in charge has had a hearing as provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 34-4 and on the basis of evidence produced at such hearing, or on the basis of their examination in the event a written request for a hearing is not received within ten days, the health authority may vacate the hold order, or may by written order direct the owner or person in charge of the food which was placed under the hold order to denature or destroy such food or to bring it into compliance with the provisions of this Chapter; provided, that such order of the health authority to denature or destroy such food or bring it into compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall be stayed if the order is appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction within three days.

Sec. 35-101 Tests required on industrial wastes for compliance with governmental regulations and special conditions.
The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this Ordinance and any special conditions for discharge established by the City of Rolla or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge.

The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the City of Rolla, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the City of Rolla at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the City of Rolla. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the City of Rolla. At such times as deemed necessary, the City of Rolla reserves the right to take measurements and samples of analyses by an outside laboratory service. (Ord. 2136, §2; Ord. 2886, §3.)



Sec. 35-102. Determination of measurements, tests, etc.; applicability of certain publication; method of sampling.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this Ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.

The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. (Ord. 2136, §2; Ord. 2886, §3.)



Sec. 35-103. Special agreements between city and industrial concern.

Sec. 35-125. Basis for wastewater service charges.
The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the City of Rolla shall consist of a service availability fee for the operation and maintenance of the collection system and a basic wastewater treatment user charge for wastewater treatment operation, maintenance and replacement, sewer system reserve fund, and a surcharge rate for BOD and SS.

The service availability fee shall be based on the estimated cost for the collection system operation, maintenance and replacement costs.

The basic wastewater treatment user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters having the following normal concentrations:

A five day, 20 degree centigrade (20oC) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/1.
A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/1.
It shall consist of treatment operation, maintenance and replacement costs plus sewer system reserve fund costs and shall be computed as follows:

Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year and a sewer system reserve fund, for all works categories.
Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by Volume, Suspended Solids and BOD, if possible.
Estimate wastewater Volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be treated.
Proportion the estimated costs of non-industrial users by Volume, Suspended Solids and BOD.
Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength.
Compute surcharge costs per pound and BOD and SS in excess of normal sewage strength.
A surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastewater exceeds the normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/1) and SS (250 mg/1).  The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/1 and 250 mg/1 concentration for BOD and SS respectively.  Section 35-129 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.

That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for operation and maintenance including replacement purposes as established in Section 35-126, shall be deposited in a separate non-lapsing fund known as the Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Fund and will be kept in two primary accounts as follows:

An account designated for the specific purpose of defraying operation and maintenance costs (excluding replacement) of both collection and treatment works (Operation and Maintenance Account).
An account designated for the specific purpose of ensuring replacement needs over the useful life of the treatment works (Replacement Account).  Deposits in the replacement account shall be made annually from the operation, maintenance and replacement revenue in the amount of $272,189 annually. 
The adequacy of the service availability fee and the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by accountants for the City of Rolla and presented in their annual audit report.  The service availability fee and the wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in operation and maintenance costs, replacement costs, or the sewer system reserve fund.

The City will review the user charge system every year and revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance including replacement and that the system continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and maintenance including replacement costs among users and user classes.

The City will notify each user at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate being charged for operation, maintenance including replacement of the treatment works.

The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increment of 1000 gallons.

If the person discharging wastes into the public sewer procures any part, or all, of his water from sources other than the City of Rolla Water System, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the Public Works Director for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the Public Works Director if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records.
Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person.  Following approval and installation such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled, without the consent of the Public Works Director.  (Ord. 2136, §2; Ord. 2886, §3; Ord. 3486, §2; Ord. 3881, §2; Ord. 4379, §2)


Sec. 35-126. Basic user rate for metered users.
Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on his use of the treatment works as determined by water meters acceptable to the City.

User charges shall be based on water used during the current month.  If a user has a consumptive use of water, or in some other manner uses water which is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based on a wastewater meters or separate water meters installed and maintained at the contributor's expense, and in a manner acceptable to the City.

On a monthly basis each contributor shall pay a user charge rate for operation and maintenance including replacement for each 1,000 gallons of water use.

This rate per 1,000 gallons shall be as follows:

As of first billing after

January 1, 2018            $5.25/1,000 gallons

The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling.  Waste sampling shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the Public Works Director and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.  The wastewater surcharge shall be computed by the formula:

Total monthly charge to extra strength user =
V ($5.25/1000 gal unit charge)
+ V ($0.926/1000 gal unit BOD charge) (BODes-BODnd)(.00834)
+ V ($0.741/1000 gal unit SS charge) (sees - SEND)(.00834)
Where:

V is the Volume of wastewater in 1000 gallons discharged by the extra strength user during the month.
Unit flow charge is in $/1000 gal from paragraph 4
Unit BOD charge is in $/lb BOD from paragraph 4Unit SS charge is in $/lb SS from paragraph 4
BOD is the normal BOD strength in milligrams per liter (mg/1) as defined in Sec. 35-124 of the ordinance.
SS is the normal domestic SS strength in mg/1 as defined in Sec. 35-124 of the ordinance and .00834 is a unit conversion factor.

General Policy

Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is:

To ban the use of lead materials in the public drinking water system and private plumbing connected to the public drinking water system; and

To protect city residents from lead contamination in the citys public drinking water system and their own private plumbing systems.

Application. This ordinance shall apply to all premises served by the public drinking water system of the city of Rolla, Missouri.

Policy. This ordinance will be reasonably interpreted by the water purveyor. It is the purveyors intent to ban the use of lead based material in the construction or modification of the citys drinking water system or private plumbing connected to the city system. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement the lead ban.

If, in the judgment of the water purveyor or his authorized representative, lead based materials have been used in new construction or modifications after January 4 2014, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall immediately comply by having the lead base materials removed from the plumbing system and replaced with lead free materials. If the lead base materials are not removed from the plumbing system, the water purveyor shall have the right to discontinue water service to the premises.
(Ord. 4248, §1)

Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 35-226 of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self monitoring requirements of Section 35-222, 35-224, and 35- 224 of this ordinance.

Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A, above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.

In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city engineer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.

In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-231 Analytical Requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If-40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-232 Sample Collection.
Except as indicated in Section (b), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city engineer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.

Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-233 Timing.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-234 Record Keeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city engineer. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-235 Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling.
The city engineer shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city engineer ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city engineer will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.

The city engineer shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.

The city engineer may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated every six (6) months to ensure their accuracy.

Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city engineer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.

Unreasonable delays in allowing the city engineer access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this ordinance. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-236 Refused Access.
If the city engineer has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routing inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city engineer may proceed as outlined in Sec. 35-245 and immediately suspend the user's discharge. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-237 Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city engineer's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-238 Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.
The city engineer shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:

Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six- (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;

Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six(6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);

Any other discharge violation that the city engineer believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;

Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city engineer's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;

Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or

Any other violation(s) which the city engineer determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-239 Notification of Violation
When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city engineer may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city engineer. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the

Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city engineer to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-240 Consent Orders.
The city engineer may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 35-242 and 35-243 of this ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-241 Show Cause Hearing.
The city engineer may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city engineer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-242 Compliance Orders.
When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city engineer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violations, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-243 Cease and Desist Orders.
When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city engineer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:

(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and

(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-244 Administrative Penalties
When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city engineer, with City of Rolla Council approval, may penalize such user in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500). Such penalties shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, penalties shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.

Unpaid charges and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of one tenth percent (0.1%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of three percent (3%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges and penalties.

Users desiring to dispute such penalties must file a written request for the city engineer to reconsider the penalty along with full payment of the penalty amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the penalty. The City of Rolla Council will convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The City of Rolla Council may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the penalty.

Issuance of an administrative penalty shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-245 Emergency Suspensions.
The city engineer may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonable appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city engineer may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.

Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city engineer may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 35-246 of this ordinance are initiated against the user.

A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city engineer prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 35-241 or 35-246 of this ordinance. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-246 Termination of Discharge.
In addition to the provisions in Section 35-219 of this ordinance, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:

Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;

Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of it discharge;

Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;

Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or

Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 35-198 of this ordinance.

Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 35-241 of this ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city engineer shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-247 Injunctive Relief.
When the city engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city engineer may petition the Municipal Court through the City's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The city engineer may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 248 Civil Penalties.
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

The city engineer may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.

In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstance, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.

Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-249 Prosecution for Violations.
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be in violation of this chapter, punishable by a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.

A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be in violation of this chapter and be subject to a penalty of at least five hundred dollars ($500.00), or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.

A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with-, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be subject to a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.

In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be subject to a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year(s), or both. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-250 Remedies Nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this ordinance are not exclusive. The city engineer may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However, the city engineer may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city engineer is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-251 Performance Bonds.
The city engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the city engineer to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-252 Liability Insurance.
The city engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-253 Water Supply Severance.
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-254 Public Nuisances.
A violation of any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the city engineer. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the Rolla City Code Chapter 28, Sections 28-1 thru 28-17 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-255 Contractor Listing [Optional].
Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the City held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the city engineer. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-256 Upset.
For the purposes of this section, "upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met.
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
The facility was the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
The user has submitted the following information to the city engineer within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance;
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof;
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on an claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought of noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards;
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility i restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 3183)

Sec. 35-257 Prohibited Discharge Standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 35-198(a) of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in Section 35-198(b)(3) through 35-256(f) of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:

A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or

No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-258 Bypass.
For the purposes of this section,

"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.

"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. (c) If a user knows in advance of need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city engineer, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
A user shall submit oral notice to the city engineer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (S) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city engineer may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.

Bypass is prohibited, and the city engineer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or sever property damage;

There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section.

The city engineer may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city engineer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d) of this section. (Ord. 3183)


Sec. 35-259 Pretreatment Charges and Fees.
The City may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the City's Pretreatment Program which may include:

Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications;

Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;

Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;

Fees for filing appeals; and

Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this ordinance and are separate from all other fees and penalties chargeable by the City. (Ord. 3183)



Sec. 35-260 Severability.
If any provision of this ordinance is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect. (Ord. 3183)

Any hearing requested under this section shall be held as soon as possible after the request at the next regularly scheduled bi-monthly meeting of the City Council. All interested parties may appear at such hearing either in person or by attorney and present evidence concerning the matters at issue.

Lease Required for Public Lands. Unless otherwise provided, use or installation of any facilities or other structure within non-rights-of-way public property of the city shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms as the city may require.

In case of failure on the part of the ROW user, including its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the provisions of Articles III-VI or a ROW Use Agreement or Franchise, or if the ROW user, its successors and assigns should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of Articles III-VI or the terms of the authorization of such use, or otherwise loses authority to provide its service in the city, the ROW user, its successors and assigns shall forfeit all rights and privileges permitted by any ROW Use Agreement or Franchise, and all rights thereunder shall cease, terminate, and become null and void, provided that said forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the following proceedings: Before the city declares the forfeiture or revocation of a ROW Use Agreement or Franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon the person setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and the person shall have thirty (30) days thereafter, or such other reasonable period established by the Director of Public Works, in which to cure the default by complying with the conditions of the such ROW Use Agreement or Franchise and fully remedying any default or violation. If at the end of such period, the city determines that the conditions have not been complied with and that the person did not reasonably and in the public interest require more than the established time to cure the default, the city shall take action by an affirmative vote of the city council present at the meeting and voting to terminate the ROW Use Agreement or Franchise, setting out the grounds upon which said authorization is to be forfeited or revoked. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from invoking any other remedy or from declaring immediate forfeiture where the default is incapable of being cured by the ROW user, including where such defaults or violations have repeatedly occurred. (Ord. 4469, §1)
 



Sec. 36-27. Application for Franchise or ROW Use Agreement.

Application Deposit Fee. An application deposit of $500.00, or such other amount determined to be required, shall be submitted with the application, which shall be utilized to at least partly offset the citys costs in reviewing and issuing an agreement, consistent with applicable law provided that no costs shall be included if such inclusion is prohibited by applicable law as to that person; any amount not used by the city for its actual lawfully reimbursable costs will be refunded upon request after execution of a ROW Use Agreement or Franchise. If applicable, the applicant shall be obligated to reimburse the city for its reasonable expenses associated with the review, negotiation, and adoption of an appropriate ROW Use Agreement or Franchise that may exceed the application deposit.

Standard for Approval or Renewal. In reviewing an application for a new or renewal ROW Use Agreement or Franchise, the city may consider prior conduct of the person in performance of its obligations or compliance with the city's ordinances in the past, or the existence of any outstanding violations or deficiencies. The city may deny or condition any ROW Use Agreement outstanding violations or deficiencies. The city may deny or condition any ROW Use Agreement or Franchise where the proposed use would interfere with the public use of the rights-of-way or otherwise conflict with the legitimate public interests of the city to fulfill the requirements and objectives of Articles III-VI or as otherwise provided by law. All ROW Use Agreements or Franchises may be approved by ordinance or resolution of the city council after receipt of an executed copy from applicant, and applications shall be decided on a non-discriminatory basis and shall be approved, conditioned or denied based on compliance with all applicable requirements herein, and conformance with applicable law and the public interest. The city may, if appropriate, notwithstanding the provisions herein approve form agreements that may be executed by the Director of Public Works in substantially the form approved.

(Ord. 4469, §1)


Sec. 36-28. General Row obligations.

Compliance with Laws. Each ROW user shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and rules as well as all city ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations heretofore and hereafter adopted or established.

Zoning, Safety, and Building Code Compliance.  ROW users shall at all times be subject to the lawful exercise of the police powers of the city, including but not limited to all police powers regarding zoning, supervision of the restoration of the rights-of-way, building and safety regulations, and control of the rights-of-way currently in effect or as may be amended.  Installation of all facilities in the rights-of-way are subject to and must be in compliance with all applicable zoning and safety and building code requirements. For applications for installation of any facility in the rights-of-way, the most restrictive adjacent underlying zoning district classification shall apply unless otherwise specifically zoned and designated on the official zoning district map.

No Warranties. The city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way and shall not be liable for any damages therefrom. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon the ROW user. The ROW user shall be solely liable for any damages to facilities or other property due to excavation, facilities maintenance, or other work performed prior to obtaining the location of all facilities that have been properly identified prior to such work. The ROW user shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation, or replacement of damaged or disturbed facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities.

No Waiver.  No action or omission of the city shall operate as a future waiver of any rights of the city under Articles III-VI. Except where rights are expressly granted or waived by a ROW Permit, ROW Use Agreement, Franchise, or License they are reserved, whether or not expressly enumerated.

No Cause of Action Against the City. As a condition for use of the rights-of-way, a ROW user shall have no damages, remedy, or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any ROW Use Agreement, Franchise, or License, or because of the enforcement thereof by the city, or from the use of the rights-of-way.  Nothing herein shall preclude the ROW user from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the city where such relief is otherwise available, and the requirements therefor are otherwise satisfied.

Maintenance of Facilities.  Each ROW user shall maintain its facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements.

Subordinate Use. The ROW users use shall be, in all situations, subordinate and subject to public municipal use.

Responsible for Subcontractors. If excavation or facilities maintenance is being done for the ROW user by another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the ROW user shall be responsible for ensuring that the excavation or facilities maintenance of said person is performed consistent with its ROW Permit and applicable law (including that the contractor shall be properly licensed under the State of Missouri and local ordinances) and shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by said person.

Insurance; Exceptions. Except as provided in this section, each ROW user shall provide, at its sole expense, and maintain during the term of any ROW Use Agreement or Franchise or anytime the ROW user has facilities in the ROW, commercial general liability insurance with a reputable, qualified, and financially sound company licensed to do business in the State of Missouri, and unless otherwise approved by the city, with a rating by Best of not less than "A", that shall protect the ROW user, the city, and the city's officials, officers, and employees, from claims which may arise from such use of the ROW, whether such operations are by the ROW user, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, or any contractors or subcontractors of the ROW user. This liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property, resulting from all ROW users operations, products, services, or use of automobiles or construction equipment. The amount of insurance for single limit coverage applying to bodily and personal injury and property damage shall be in no event less than the individual and combined sovereign immunity limits established by § 537.610 RSMo. for political subdivisions; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive the city's sovereign immunity. An endorsement which states that the city as an additional insured with full and equivalent coverage as the insured under the insureds policy and stating that the policy shall not be cancelled or materially modified so as to be out of compliance with the requirements of this section, or not renewed without thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such event being given to the Director or Public Works.  If the person is self-insured, it shall provide the city proof of compliance regarding its ability to self-insure and proof of its ability to provide coverage in the above amounts. The insurance requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to a ROW user to the extent and for such period as the ROW user is exempted from such requirements pursuant to § 67.1830(6)(a) RSMo. and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a history of permitting noncompliance with the City. Additionally, in accordance with § 67.5121(3), a self-insured ROW user shall not be required to obtain insurance naming the city as an additional insured solely to the extent such ROW user is utilizing Small Wireless Facilities as defined in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act within the ROW. This exception to the citys insurance requirements shall only apply as related to Small Wireless Facilities and shall not otherwise alter the obligations of a ROW user to provide appropriate insurance to the city for any other activities or operations.  The city may waive any and all requirements under this subsection when deemed to be lawful and in the public interest.

Performance and Maintenance Bonds.

Bond Required.  Prior to any work, a ROW user shall establish in the city's favor a performance and maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the Director of Public Works to guarantee the restoration of the rights-of-way as more fully provided in Section 36-77. The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a period of forty-eight (48) months following completion of the work. The Director may waive this requirement when the work involves, as determined in the sole discretion of the Director, no or only minor disruption or damage to the rights-of-way.

Failure to Satisfactorily Complete Restoration.  If a ROW user fails to complete the restoration work in a safe, timely, and competent manner or if the completed restorative work fails without remediation within the time period for the bond (as determined by the Director of Public Works), then after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the ROW user and the cost of completing work in or restoring the rights-of-way, up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund or letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available under a security fund or letter of credit.

Bond Terms.  The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the city's attorney and shall contain the following endorsement: "This bond may not be cancelled or allowed to lapse until sixty (60) days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew."

Exception.  The city may waive any and all requirements under this subsection when deemed to be lawful and in the public interest.   Further, in lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in the city's favor such other security as the Director of Public Works may determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding requirements including, but not limited to, an annual bond to be maintained in the minimum amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). The bond requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to a ROW user to the extent and for such period as the ROW user is exempted from such requirements pursuant to § 67.1830(6)(a) RSMo. and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and facts otherwise demonstrating the ROW user is exempted, unless otherwise provided by a ROW Use Agreement or Franchise or the city determines such exemption has not been adequately shown. Additionally, in accordance with § 67.5121(4), the bonds required for Small Wireless Facilities as defined in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act shall not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per Small Wireless Facility or more seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) for all Small Wireless Facilities within the ROW of a ROW user. This exception to the citys bonding requirements shall only apply as related to such Small Wireless Facilities and shall not otherwise alter the obligations of a ROW user to provide appropriate bonds to the city for any other activities or operations.

Indemnification. Any person performing excavation or a ROW user as a condition of use of the rights-of-way shall at its sole cost and expense fully indemnify, protect, defend (with counsel acceptable to the city), and hold harmless the city, its municipal officials, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, and actions, liability, and judgment by other persons for damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including attorney fees, arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from the action or inaction of the person performing excavation or ROW user, its agents, representatives, employees, contractors, subcontractors, or any other person for whose acts the person performing excavation or ROW user may be liable, in constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing, restoring, or removing facilities or other structures, or use of the rights-or-way or the activities performed, or failed to be performed, by the person performing excavation or ROW user under Articles III-VI or applicable law, or otherwise, except to the extent arising from or caused by the sole or gross negligence or willful misconduct of the city, its elected officials, officers, employees, agents, or contractors. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the city, or any agent from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their own expense. Such participation shall not under any circumstances relieve the person from the duty to defend against liability or its duty to pay any judgment entered against the city or its agents. This indemnification shall survive the expiration or termination of any ROW Use Agreement, Franchise, License, or ROW Permit.  Provided however, that in accordance with § 67.5121(2), a ROW user which is a Wireless Provider,  for and in relation to that the Wireless Providers  operation of a Small Wireless Facility as defined in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act within the ROW, shall only indemnify and hold the city, its officers and employees, harmless against any damage or personal injury caused by the negligence of the ROW user, its employees, agents, or contractors.

ROW User Responsible for Costs. The ROW user shall be responsible for all reasonable costs borne by the city that are directly associated with ROW user's installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use, and replacement of its facilities in the rights-of-way that are not otherwise accounted for as part of the ROW Permit fee established pursuant to Article IV, or other applicable application fee with respect to a ROW users request to place facilities in the ROW, to the extent permitted by law. All such costs shall be itemized, and the city's books and records related to these costs shall be made available upon request of the ROW user.  (Ord. 4469, §1)
 


Sec. 36-29. Facility location requirements.

Exclusion of Certain Locations/Facilities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Director of Public Works may designate certain locations or facilities in the rights-of-way to be excluded from use by the ROW user, including but not limited to, ornamental or similar specially-designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment of the Director of Public Works cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof, or any other facility or location that in the reasonable judgment of the Director of Public Works would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation; provided, however, that pursuant to R.S.Mo. 67.5112(6), a wireless provider shall be permitted to replace decorative poles when necessary to collocate a Small Wireless Facility so long as any such replacement pole reasonably conforms to the design aesthetics of the decorative poles being replaced. The Director of Public Works may further exclude certain other facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by the ROW user due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal, or other limitations or restrictions as may be reasonably determined by the city. In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable requirements of the ROW user, the city will cooperate in good faith with the ROW user to attempt to find suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the city shall not be required to incur financial cost nor require the city to acquire new locations for the ROW user.

Location, Type, and Design of Facilities Subject to Approval.

Review Required.  The design, location, and nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director of Public Works. Such review shall be on a non-discriminatory basis in application of city policy and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. City height limitations, applicable zoning restrictions, and general city policies with regard to all users of the rights-of-way shall be applicable to all facilities. The Director of Public Works may establish regulations or policies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to affect this provision.

Underground and Collocation of Facilities Required; Exceptions.  Except as provided herein or where prohibited by applicable law, no person may erect, construct, or install new poles or other facilities above the surface of the rights-of-way without the written permission of the city based on good cause established by applicant and found by the city. In addition, all new fiber optics, coaxial, and similar cable facilities shall be located within existing conduit, trenches, or other facilities to minimize unnecessary use of rights-of-way space, reduce potential existing or future interference and obstructions, and to reduce the cost to the public or others therefrom, and to maximize the publics ability to use and license appropriate private or public uses of the rights-of-way in the public interest except where preempted by law or where good cause is established and written permission granted by the city.  Such permission may be granted by the city council when other similar facilities exist above-ground and conditions are such that underground construction is impossible, impractical or unfeasible, as determined by the city, and when in the city's judgment the above-ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed. Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate rights-of-way exists, the ROW user shall place above-ground facilities underground in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible. New utility poles and related ground mounted equipment shall be permitted to be installed above ground; provided, however, that to ensure unobstructed pedestrian use and city maintenance of the ROW and minimize visual obstructions for vehicular traffic, a new utility pole and any ground mounted equipment related to that utility pole or the equipment thereon shall not be installed within one hundred and fifty feet (150) of another utility pole or other ground mounted equipment on the same side of the ROW.  A replacement utility pole that is installed in lieu of an existing utility pole and is installed within ten feet (10) of the existing utility pole, shall not be considered a new utility pole subject to the spacing requirements herein. Such spacing regulations as applied to that specific site may be altered by the City Administrator upon good cause shown by the applicant including: (1) when and where nearby utility poles exist that are spaced closer than one hundred and fifty feet (150) apart; (2) when conditions are such that no existing structure is available for placement of facilities; and (3) the utility pole can be placed to be minimally visually intrusive.

Wireless Antennas and Facilities.  Pursuant to city authority, including Section 67.1830 RSMo. and the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (§§ 67.5110 et seq. RSMo.), and to properly manage the limited space in the citys rights-of-way, minimize obstructions and interference with the use of the rights-of-way by the public and to ensure public safety, while also seeking to facilitate delivery of broadband technologies to city residents and businesses, wireless facilities shall be permitted in the rights-of-way in compliance with the requirements applicable to other facilities and users in the rights-of-way, and the additional requirements set forth in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act and this subsection for wireless antennas and facilities. 

General Conditions.  Except as prohibited by law, any wireless facility in the rights-of-way shall be subject to conditions relating to the location (including prohibited or limited locations), design, height, appearance, safety, radio-frequency interference, and other interference issues as may be lawfully imposed by the city where necessary or appropriate to protect the public, and to conform to policies and interests of the public as may be set forth in special district plans, historic areas, or other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the Director of Public Works to address changing infrastructure, technology, and uses of the rights-of-way and/or city facilities.  A wireless facility shall not be located or installed in a manner that results in interference with or impairs the operation of existing utility facilities or city or third-party attachments. Wireless antennas or facilities shall further comply with (1) all applicable requirements for installation of any facilities in the rights-of-way as set forth in Articles III-V including a ROW Permit, (2) the applicable requirements of this section; and (3) requirements for installation of wireless antennas and facilities set forth in the Uniform Wireless Communications Infrastructure Deployment Act (§§ 67.5090 et seq. RSMo.), Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (§§ 67.5110 et seq. RSMo.), applicable zoning, building, and other regulations and approvals, specifically including Chapter 42.

Specific Conditions.

Small Wireless Facilities. Any small wireless facility meeting the requirements for small wireless facility as defined by Section 42-397 and as provided in Section 42-400 shall be authorized to be located in the rights-of-way with approval of the Director of Public Works subject to the following additional requirements:

If proposing to install a new authority pole as defined by Section 42-397, compliance with the spacing requirements herein;

Compliance with § 67.5113.3(9) RSMo. to the satisfaction of the city;

For collocations on city authority poles, all make-ready estimates for the authority pole, including replacement costs where necessary for the safety and reliability of the utility pole, as determined by the city;

Attestation that the proposed small wireless facility meets the volumetric requirements to meet the definition of a small wireless facility in Section 42-397; and

Any other requirements which may be applicable to the proposed small wireless facility pursuant to the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (§§ 67.5110 et seq. RSMo.).

"Fast-Track" Small Wireless Collocation.  Any wireless facility meeting the requirements of a fast-track as defined by Section 42-397, and as provided in Section 42-401, may be authorized to be located in the rights-of-way with approval of the Director of Public Works subject to the following additional requirements:

Attestation that the proposed facilities meet the volumetric requirements to meet the definition of fast-track in Section 42-397;

No ground equipment shall be authorized;

If the proposed structure the applicant proposes to locate its fast-track is not structurally sound, but the Director finds such to be a desired location, the Director of Public Works can require the applicant to install a new substantially similar structure at its cost; and

Compliance with the spacing requirements herein if granted a waiver under the fast-track zoning procedure to install a new structure.

All other Wireless in ROW.  Any wireless facility located on a utility pole, authority pole, or existing structure as defined by Section 42-397 but not meeting the requirements of (a) Small Wireless Facilities or (b) Fast-Track Small Wireless Collocation above, may be approved, subject to reasonable and nondiscriminatory conditions as may be imposed consistent with the purposes of this section, only upon approval by the City Administrator upon a determination by the City Administrator, to the extent the same considerations apply to requests for placements of other types of infrastructure deployments, that such wireless facility: (1) does not negatively impact appearance or property values in light of the location, design, and circumstances to be approved, (2) does not create any reasonable safety risk, and (3) complies with all applicable and reasonable zoning, rights-of-way, and other applicable requirements.

Wireless Facility Compensation.  If the small wireless facility or fast track is to be located on a city owned structure or authority pole, but not including the assets of Rolla Municipal Utilities (RMU) an annual payment of $150.00 per attachment shall be required. To extent permitted by applicable law, the rates for collocation of facilities on assets owned by RMU shall be established by RMU.

Application Requirements.  Any application including one or more wireless antennas or facilities shall include all applicable and lawful requirements: (1) for installation of any facilities in the rights-of-way as set forth in Articles III-IV(2) of this section; and (3) for installation of wireless antennas and facilities set forth in the Uniform Wireless Communications Infrastructure Deployment Act (§§ 67.5090 et. seq. RSMo.), citys zoning code, and other applicable law including written proof of consent of landowner and of structure owner.

Mapping of Facilities. Upon completion of the ROW work involving installation of new facilities, the ROW user shall supply the city copies of as-built and detailed maps showing the exact location of all facilities installed in the ROW after August 28, 2001 in the electronic form that the ROW user keeps such data.  As a condition of continued ROW use, all ROW users shall, on an annual basis, provide the city with as-builts or other detailed maps of the ROW users current facilities in the electronic form that the ROW user keeps such data. Such annual requirement may be waived by the Director of Public Works upon written request.

Sight Triangle Maintained.  ROW users shall comply with the requirements of site triangles and nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision within the triangular area formed by the rights-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points as reasonably determined by the Director of Public Works from their point of intersection so as to ensure public safety is maintained. 

No Interference. All ROW users shall construct and maintain its facilities so as not to disrupt or interfere with other users of the rights-of-way including the city. The ROW user shall not interfere with or alter the facilities of the city or other ROW user without their consent and shall be solely responsible for such.  Except as may otherwise be provided or as determined by the Director of Public Works, the ROW user shall, prior to commencement of work, execute a city-approved resident-notification plan to notify residents affected by the proposed work. All construction and maintenance by the ROW user or its subcontractors shall be performed in accordance with industry standards. The ROW user shall, in the performance of any excavation, facilities maintenance, or other ROW work, limit such work to that necessary for efficient operation and so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. All facilities and other structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners, ROW users, and the city. Facilities and other structures shall not be placed where they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities, structures, or public improvements or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the city or public improvements. If authorized, above-ground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the Director may require as alternatives to the proposed work either less disruptive methods or different locations for facilities consistent with applicable law.
(Ord. 4469, §1)



Sec. 36-30. Relocation of facilities.
City Required Relocation. The ROW user shall promptly remove, relocate, or adjust any facilities located in the rights-of-way as directed by the city when such is required by public necessity, or public convenience and security require it, or such other findings in the public interest that may require relocation, adjustment, or removal at the cost of the ROW user. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the ROW user within the time frames established by the city and at the ROW user's sole expense without any expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations, and schedules of the city pertaining to such.

Emergency Exception. In the event of an emergency or where construction equipment or facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may, to the extent allowed by law, remove, re-lay, or relocate such construction equipment or the pertinent parts of such facilities without charge to the city for such action or for restoration or repair. The city shall attempt to notify the person having facilities in the rights-of-way prior to taking such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent the same. Thereafter, the city shall notify the person having facilities in the rights-of-way as soon as practicable.

Abandonment Exception. Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW user may abandon the facilities if approved by the city as provided below in this section.

ROW User Responsible for Damage. Any damages suffered by the city, its agents, or its contractors to the extent caused by the ROW user's failure to timely relocate, remove, or adjust its facilities, or failure to properly relocate, remove, or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the ROW user. Where the ROW user shall fail to relocate facilities as required by the city, the city may, but shall not be required to, upon notice to the ROW user remove the obstructing facilities with or without further delay and the ROW user shall bear all responsibility and liability for the consequences therefrom, and the city shall bear no responsibility to the ROW user or others for damage resulting from such removal.

No Vested Rights. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property and no person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location of any facilities in the rights-of-way shall be a vested interest or property right.

Abandoned Facilities; Removal. A person owning abandoned facilities in the rights-of-way must not later than thirty (30) days of notice or of abandonment remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The Director of Public Works may upon written application and written approval allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the Director determines that it is in the best interest of public health, safety, and general welfare to do so. The city shall be entitled to all costs of removal and enforcement for any violation of this provision.

Nuisance. Facilities abandoned or otherwise left unused in violation of Articles III-V are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function, or (c) requiring the removal of the facility by the ROW user. (Ord. 4469, §1)
Secs. 36-31 to 36-40.  Reserved.

ARTICLE IV - ROW PERMITS
Sec. 36-41.  Excavation Permit required  exceptions.
No person shall make or cause to be made any excavations nor construct, reconstruct, repair, alter, or grade any sidewalk, curb, curb cut, driveway, or street in any ROW without an Excavation Permit issued by the Director of Public Works to do so, except public work done under the authority of the city council or in the case of an emergency. The cost of said permit shall be set out by the Director of Public Works.

An Excavation Permit should be obtained for each project unless otherwise provided for by the Director of Public Works. A separate special permit or lease shall be required for excavation in or use of any real property interest of the city that is not ROW. (Ord. 4469, §1)

That the applicant agrees to follow all rules and regulations for sidewalk closures issued by the Director of Public Works.

Renewal.  ROW Permits will be allowed to be renewed once; provided that the time granted in the original ROW Permit plus the time granted in such renewal Permit shall not exceed thirty (30) days. Additional renewals will require the applicant to make application to the city council.

Transferability.  Unless otherwise provided or as otherwise required by law, no ROW Permit may be transferred or assigned without the written application to and consent of the Director of Public Works based on the requirements and policies of Articles III-V.

Condition Imposition.  The Director of Public Works may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a ROW Permit and the performance of work in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. Installation and collocation of small wireless facility, as defined by Section 42-397, shall be completed within one (1) year of issuance of the ROW Permit or the ROW Permit shall become null and void and shall no longer authorize installation or collocation such small wireless facility. (Ord. 4469, §1)


Sec. 36-47. ROW Permit requirements
ROW Permit Conditions.  Every ROW Permit issued hereunder shall incorporate the applicable requirements and terms of Articles III-VI, agreements, and all applicable ordinances, to the extent permitted by law.  The ROW user shall perform such work in accordance with the issued permit and applicable provisions of Articles III-VI and any subsequent ordinances or regulations that may be adopted by the city regarding excavation or obstruction work in effect at the time such permit issues. In addition, all ROW users shall be subject to all technical specifications, design criteria, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the city in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to ROW Permits and fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, facility location, construction coordination, surface restoration, and other requirements on the use of the rights-of-way. A ROW user shall perform all excavations or obstruction work in full compliance with all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the city, and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Missouri, and the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and any other local, state, or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. The ROW user shall comply with the excavation requirements established by §§ 319.010 et. seq. RSMo., as amended. A ROW user shall be responsible for all excavations or obstruction work done in the rights-of-way on its behalf, regardless of by whom the work is done.

Emergency Exception.  In the event of an emergency requiring immediate attention to remedy defects, and in order to avoid loss of damage to person or property, it shall be sufficient that the person conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify the city of the location of the work and shall apply for the required permit as soon as practicable following the commencement of the work, not to exceed the third (3rd) business day thereafter, or as otherwise directed by the Director of Public Works. In the event the city becomes aware of an emergency requiring facilities work the Director of Public Works shall attempt to contact a representative of each ROW user affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency work.  If no response is received by a particular ROW user to whom contact is attempted, the Director of Public Works may take whatever action he/she deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the person whose action or inaction occasioned the emergency or by the ROW user if the emergency was occasioned by an act of nature.

Displayed. At all times during the work, ROW Permits shall be conspicuously displayed at the work site and shall be available for inspection by the Director of Public Works or other city official.

ROW Permit Modification.  If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the work is or will become materially different from that allowed by the ROW Permit, the ROW user shall inform the Director of Public Works. The Director of Public Works may issue a waiver, an extension, or revised ROW Permit, or require that the ROW user reapply for a ROW Permit in accordance with all requirements of Articles III-V. (Ord. 4469, §1)



Sec. 36-48.  ROW Permit denial and revocation.
Denial.  The Director of Public Works may deny an application for a ROW Permit if:

To the extent permitted by law, the person does not have a current Franchise, License, or ROW Use Agreement, or other authorization with the city.

The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, fails to provide all the necessary information requested by the city for managing the rights-of-way.

The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has a history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city. For purposes of this section, "history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city" shall include where the ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has failed to return the rights-of-way to its previous condition under a previous ROW Permit, or has violated terms, or is in violation of terms of the ROW users' Franchise, ROW Use Agreement, License, or other authorization with the city.

The city has provided the ROW user with a reasonable, competitively neutral, and nondiscriminatory justification for requiring an alternative method for performing the excavation or facilities maintenance identified in the ROW Permit application, or a reasonable alternative route that will not result in additional installation expense of more than ten (10) percent to the ROW user or a declination of service quality. This shall not apply with respect to ROW Permits related to installing Small Wireless Facilities or Utility Poles for collocation of Small Wireless Facilities.

Any other violations or noncompliance caused by or through the ROW user of any applicable city, state, or federal law or regulation, except where such violation is prohibited by applicable law for being a basis for denial. 

Revocation.  The Director may, after reasonable notice and an opportunity to cure, revoke a ROW Permit without fee refund, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and material conditions of the ROW Permit.  A substantial breach by a ROW User includes but is not limited to:

A material violation of a provision of the ROW Permit;

An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the ROW Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;

A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW Permit application;

A failure to complete work by the date specified in the ROW Permit, unless a ROW Permit extension is obtained, or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the ROW user's control;

A failure to correct, within the time specified by the city, work that does not conform to applicable national safety codes, industry construction standards, or local safety codes, upon inspection and notification by the city of the faulty condition; or

Such other lawful reasons. (Ord. 4469, §1)

Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified by the Director of Public Works and to his/her satisfaction.

The initial cut in a street pavement shall be equal to the width of the trench with the option of being jack hammered or saw cut. The final cut in an asphaltic concrete street pavement shall be one (1) foot wider than the trench width and shall be made only by saw cutting of the pavement.

For cuts in concrete paved streets, concrete pavement replacement shall be full slab length (joint-to-joint) and full slab width (curb or gutter to street centerline) unless specifically authorized otherwise by the Director of Public Works.

Select backfill materials shall be required. "Select back-fill materials" shall mean those materials as established by the ROW Permit requirements and in accordance with the standard plans and specifications on file in the office of the Director of Public Works. All trenches shall be filled in their entirety with such select back-fill materials. All excess earth or dirt removed in the process of such excavation shall be removed from right-of-way by such person or his agent holding permit for such excavation.

Compaction shall meet or exceed the most current version of the standards and conditions of the city and the ASTM International (American Society for Testing and Materials).  If inspections were not requested or a valid Excavation Permit obtained, the city may require compaction testing by a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Missouri at the ROW user's expense.

Erosion Control.  Before new excavation or construction is commenced and until sodding, planting, concreting, paving, or other final surfacing is in place, which will avoid washing or spreading of dirt and mud onto other property, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way, the ROW user shall erect and maintain approved temporary erosion control measures to prevent such washing or spreading of materials. At the end of each day and as required throughout the day during the course of excavating or construction, dirt and mud on the sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way resulting from work must be removed.

Alteration of Public Structures.  Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system, or to any city, state, or other public structures or facilities in the rights-of-way required on account of the construction, installation, repair, or maintenance of facilities in the rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such facilities.

Barricades.  The ROW user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing, and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the ROW until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. All excavations and obstruction work that disturb traffic or pedestrian travel shall be barricaded in such a manner as to protect both pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Such excavations, obstruction work, and barricades shall be lighted at night with danger signals in such a manner that all traffic may be warned of the existence and location of such.

Traffic Control.  Whenever there is an excavation or obstruction work by the ROW user, the ROW User shall be responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the surrounding area as determined by the Director. All traffic control devices shall be in compliance with the current version of the standard specifications and the Manual of Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), unless otherwise agreed to by the city. All surplus excavation materials, tools, or supplies at the site of the excavation or obstruction work shall be barricaded and lighted at night in the manner described in this section. In the event the excavation or obstruction work is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the ROW user may be liable for actual damages to the city for delay caused by the ROW user pursuant to this Articles III-V. (Ord. 4469, §1)

The Public Works Director is authorized to close any ROW, public place, or highway and withdraw the same from public use temporarily and during such period as work on such ROW, public place, or highway shall make such action necessary. No person shall use or attempt to use such ROW, public place, or highway withdrawn from public use, or drive or attempt to drive any vehicle on such ROW, highway, or public place. (Ord. 4469, §1)



Sec. 36-72. Manner of performing work - generally.
In excavating in any ROW, all material for paving or macadamizing must be removed with the least possible injury or loss of the same, and together with the excavated materials from the trenches must be placed where they will cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. The width of the excavation shall be no greater than is necessary for doing the work and whenever it shall be deemed necessary by the Public Works Director, sheeting and bracing shall be used to keep the sides of the trenches perpendicular and prevent unnecessary caving. The ROW must be opened in the manner which will cause the least inconvenience to the public and admit the uninterrupted passage of water along the gutters, and every precaution must be taken to protect the trench so as to insure the public safety. (Ord. 4469, §1)

The following design guidelines shall apply to any alteration, demolition, or new construction to properties designated by the City Council, following the process outlined in this Article, as a Rolla Historic Preservation Property", so that properties will be compatible with their original style and character as well as to surrounding historic structures:

Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction should be compatible.
Doors and windows proportions: The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible.
Relationship between building masses and spaces: The relationship of a structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be compatible.
Roof type and material: The design of the roof should be compatible in terms of type and materials used.
Building scale: The scale of the building after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible.
Building facades: Facades in historic areas should blend with other structures  and should not be significantly higher or wider.
Architectural details:
Architectural details and materials should be treated so as to make an historic property compatible with its original design or its predominant architectural style.
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property should be avoided.
Changes that create a false sense of historic architecture should not be undertaken. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right may be retained and preserved or the property may be restored to its original period.
Deteriorated historic features should be repaired rather than replaced. When replacement is required, the new feature shall match the old design and, where economically feasible, materials.
Chemical or physical treatments for surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting is not recommended.
Archaeological resources: Significant archaeological resources affected by a project should be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures should be undertaken.
Signage: The character of signs should be in compliance with City regulations and in keeping with historic or architectural character of the individual property and the surrounding district. The RHPC shall recommend approval or denial prior to any installation assuming the sign code is met.
Minimum maintenance: The minimum maintenance standards shall be those outlined in the Property Maintenance Code adopted and updated by the City Council.
Ordinary maintenance: Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior element of any building or structure. Ordinary maintenance is defined as work, for which a building permit is not required, where the purpose and effect of such work is to correct any deterioration or decay of or damage to a structure and to restore the same to its condition prior to the occurrence of such deterioration, decay, or damage.
Exclusion: This article shall not be construed to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any such elements, which the authorized municipal officers shall consider as necessary for the health, safety, or community welfare. (Ord. 4106)

Sec. 42-9. Approval of improvements.
The city of Rolla Council has adopted a comprehensive plan of the City of Rolla, therefor, no street or other public facilities, and no public utility, whether publicly or privately owned, and the location, extent, and character thereof having been included in the comprehensive plan, shall be constructed or authorized in the city until the location, extent, and character thereof has been submitted to and approved by the commission.

Sec. 42-11. Regulations governing subdivision of land, contents - Public hearing.
The planning and zoning commission shall recommend and the council may by ordinance adopt regulations governing the subdivision of land within its jurisdiction.

The regulations may include requirements as to the extent and the manner in which the streets of the subdivision or any designated portions thereto shall be graded and improved as well as including requirements as to the extent and manner of the installation of all utility facilities, and compliance with all of these requirements is a condition precedent to the approval of the plat. No plat of a subdivision of land lying within the municipality shall be filed or recorded until it has been submitted to and a report and recommendation thereon made by the commission to the city council and the council has approved the plat as provided by law. The regulations or practices of the council may provide for the tentative approval of the plat previous to the improvements and installations; but any tentative approval shall not be entered on the plat. The regulations may provide that, in lieu of the completions of the work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat, the council may accept a bond in the amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing the actual construction and installation of the improvements and utilities within a period specified by the council and expressed in the bond; and the council may enforce the bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The regulations may provide, in lieu of the completion of the work and installation previous to the final approval of a plat, for an assessment or other method whereby the council is put in an assured position to do the work and make the installations at the cost of the owners of the property within the subdivision. The regulations may provide for the dedication, reservation or acquisition of lands and open spaces necessary for public uses indicated on the city plan and for appropriate means of providing for the compensation, including reasonable charges against the subdivision, if any, and over a period of time and in a manner as is in the public interest.

Before adoption of its subdivision regulations or any amendment thereof, a duly advertised public hearing shall be held by the commission and the council. (Ord. 2122-A, §1, 12-11-78)



Sec. 42-12. Commission to approve plats, when - Effects.
Within sixty (60) days after the submission of a plat to the commission, the commission shall approve or disapprove the plat; otherwise the plat is deemed approved by the commission, except that the commission, with the consent of the applicant for the approval, may extend the sixty (60) day period. The ground of disapproval of any plat by the commission shall be made a matter of record.

The approval of a plat by the commission does not constitute or effect an acceptance by the municipality or public of the dedication to public use of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. (Ord. 2122-A, §1, 12-11-78)



Sec. 42-13. Approval of plats required for recording.

Any person violating the provisions of this Section shall forfeit and pay to the municipality a penalty not to exceed three hundred dollars for each lot transferred or sold or agreed or negotiated to be sold, and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. A municipality may enjoin or vacate the transfer or sale or agreement by legal action and may recover the penalty in such action. (Ord. 2122-A, §1, 12-11-78)



Sec. 42-15. Public improvements, how approved after adoption of Major Thoroughfare Plan.
Upon the adoption of a major thoroughfare plan, the City shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any street, lay or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections or other utilities in any street right-of-way within the City unless the street has received the legal status of a public street prior to the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan; or unless the street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the City Council or the Planning and Zoning Commission or if the street is shown on a street plan made and adopted by the Commission. The Council may locate and construct or may accept any street if the ordinance or other measure for determining street location, construction, or for the acceptance of a street is first submitted to the Commission for its approval. If disapproved by the Commission, the City Council may override the Commission with a two-thirds majority vote of the entire membership of the Council.

Sec. 42-22. Interpretation and Purpose.
The provisions of this Article, in their interpretation and application, shall be held to the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. The purpose of this Article is to regulate the subdivision of land as defined herein. The regulations are designed to provide for the safe, orderly, and economic use of transportation facilities; to facilitate orderly land use and layout; to ensure proper legal description and monumenting of subdivided land; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent overcrowding of land; to facilitate the adequate provision of municipal services including streets, water, sewerage, electricity, parks, open space, schools, and other requirements; and to promote the development of affordable housing. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-22.1. Authority and Scope.
The City Council enacts this Article pursuant to the authority conferred by Chapter 89.300 Revised Statutes of Missouri. The Planning and Zoning Commission of Rolla, Missouri, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, is hereby designated as the administrative agency charged with the duty of making determinations and investigations concerning the design and improvements in proposed subdivisions and for making recommendations to the City Council. The City Council shall approve or disapprove plats for the subdivision of land within the City. (Ord. 3799, §1)

This Article shall apply to all land which has been subdivided if the subdivision was recorded after November 1, 1973, and to any lot or lots which re-subdivided after November 1, 1973. It is not the intent of this Article to interfere with or impair existing provisions of other laws, ordinances or covenants, except those specifically repealed by this Article. Where this Article imposes greater restriction upon land than is imposed or required by such existing laws, ordinances, or covenants, the provisions of this Article shall control. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-22.2. Conditions.
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions is a valid exercise of the police power delegated by the State of Missouri to the City. The subdivider has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions established by the Commission and City Council for design, dedication, improvement and land use so as to conform to the appropriate and economic development of the City; and to promote the safety and general welfare of future landowners in the City. The subdivision of land is a privilege conferred through these regulations to private property owners. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-23. Application of Regulations and Enforcement
No person shall divide a lot, tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, tracts, or parcels nor shall any person install a new street, alley, easement, water, sewer or electrical line or any other public improvement except in conformity with this Article; provided, however, that a real estate transaction involving the sale or exchange of a tract or parcel between contiguous platted properties, said tract or parcel sold or exchanged not being in excess of five thousand (5,000) square feet in area, where such sale or exchange does not create an additional lot(s), require any new public improvements or dedications, or violate provisions of the zoning code, shall be exempt from the requirements of this Article.

(1) Recording a Plat: No property description of any subdivision shall be entitled to be recorded in the county Recorder's office or have any validity until it shall have been approved in the manner prescribed herein. In the event any such un-approved property description is recorded, it shall be considered invalid and the City Attorney may cause proceedings to be instituted to have such plat or deed declared invalid. Recording of the property description approved in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of the subdivision.

(2) Sale of Land in a Subdivision: No owner or agent of the owner of any land located in the City shall transfer, sell, offer, or agree to sell any land by metes and bounds description or other reference when the sale, transfer, or development of the land would affect a subdivision of land within the meaning of this Article and before such land has been subdivided in accordance with these regulations and recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Phelps County.

(3) Permits: The Community Development Department shall not issue permits of any kind for improvement on land which do not meet the definition of "lot" as contained herein. For the purposes of constructing a building, permits may be issued for a tract or parcel of land consisting of two (2) or more contiguous lots or one lot and a portion of another lot and considered as a single lot if the proposed building(s) shall cross interior lot lines rather than being placed closer to a side, rear, or front lot line than otherwise allowed by ordinance.

(4) Public Improvements: The City and its Boards, Commissions and agents shall withhold all public improvements of whatever nature, including the furnishing or maintenance of streets, utilities and sewerage facilities from all subdivisions subject to this ordinance which have not been approved, and from all areas dedicated to the public which have not been accepted by the City Council, in the manner prescribed herein. Upon notice from the Community Development Director or the City Engineer to the Rolla Municipal Utilities of a violation of this ordinance, it shall be unlawful for the Utility to supply utility services to the subject property until properly subdivided as prescribed herein.

(5) Revision of a Plat. After Approval: No changes, erasures, modification or revisions shall be made in any final plat of a subdivision or in any metes and bounds description after approval has been given under the provisions of these regulations. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-24. Variances.
The Commission may approve a variance from the provisions of this Article where it finds that an undue hardship or practical difficulty may result from requiring strict compliance with this Article. A variance may be approved so that substantial justice may be achieved and the public interest secured, provided that any such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the expressed purpose of this Article. No application for preliminary plat which would create conditions requiring a variance or exception from zoning regulations by the Board of Adjustment, shall be submitted to the Commission unless and until the applicant's petition for variance or exception shall have been first approved by the Board of Adjustment. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-24.1. Conditions of Variance Approval.
No variance shall be granted by the Commission unless it is found that:

(1) The granting of the variance would not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or be injurious to other property or improvements in the vicinity of the subject property; and

(2) The conditions upon which the request for variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought, are generally not applicable to other properties, and are not self-imposed; and

(3) Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical feature of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, depriving the owner of the reasonable use of his land should the strict interpretation of these regulations be enforced.

(4) The variance will not in any manner abrogate the goals, objectives, or policies of the Rolla Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-24.2. Authority to Grant Variances.
The Commission shall be empowered to grant variances with respect to the improvements and the design standards relative to lot dimension and arrangement, street location, alignment, the location and alignment of easements, building lines and similar standards. The Commission may establish certain conditions on variance approval that will, in the judgment of the Commission, substantially secure the purpose of this Article. City Council shall review any denial for a variance or any conditions attached to a variance approval only upon a written appeal by an applicant and only upon the written record made before the Commission. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-24.3. Variance Procedure.
Variances shall be reviewed in accordance with one of the following procedures:

(1) Requests for variances may be submitted concurrently with the preliminary plat or final plat if it is a minor subdivision and reviewed with the subdivision. The written variance request shall state precisely the provisions from which a variance is needed along with the reasons for the variance, particularly as the request relates to the conditions of variance approval.

(2) Requests for variances may be submitted independent of plat review if the applicant can show good cause why such request was not made when the plat was filed.

(3) Within thirty (30) days after Commission has acted on a variance, the City Council may elect to conduct an independent review of any variance request and may grant, reverse, modify, or affirm the decision by the Commission based on the conditions for variance approval. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-24.4 Granting a variance to Sec. 42-24 relating to sidewalks and streets (Scott Family Investments, LLC.
That this variance shall be granted as stated above. (Ord. 3238, §1)



Sec. 42-25. Subdivision Application Procedure and Approval Process.
Before any plat shall be recorded or be of any validity, it shall have been presented to the Commission and approved by City Council as having fulfilled the provisions of these regulations and other applicable ordinances. The provisions of these regulations, unless otherwise stated, shall be administered by the Director. In the administration of these regulations, the Director shall:

(1) Receive and maintain current permanent records for all applications for subdivision approval. The Director shall, in conjunction with the City Engineer, review applications for completeness and substantial compliance with the subdivision regulations.

(2) Insure that copies of the subdivision regulations are available for public review and distribution.

(3) Provide such technical and consultative assistance as may be required by the Commission, City Council, and other agencies of the City in the exercise of their duties relating to these regulations. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-25.1. Procedure for Minor Subdivision Approval.
The required submission of a preliminary plat may be waived for land use actions that are carried out through the minor subdivision process. The application and approval procedures for land use actions that are carried out through the minor subdivision process are as follows:

The applicant or agent of the applicant shall submit to the Director a subdivision application, the minor subdivision application fee found in the Fee Schedule in Section 42.143.1 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code, the appropriate recording fees, five copies of the final plat, and any improvement plans or other supplementary materials.

The Commission shall review the final plat and supplementary material and any recommendations from agencies or officials. The Commission may approve as submitted, approve with conditions, or disapprove the final plat. If disapproved, the Commission shall express its reasons for this action, which shall become part of the official record.

The final plat and supplementary material along with the record of the Commission proceedings shall be forwarded to the City Council for consideration. If approved by the City Council, the Director shall sign the final plat and ensure that the provisions of Section 42-30 the Rolla City Code concerning public improvements have been satisfied prior to its recording with the Recorder of Deeds of Phelps County.

In any case, a notation of the action taken and the reason(s) the action was taken shall be entered in the records of the Commission. The preliminary plat and supplementary material along with the record of the Commission proceedings shall be forwarded to the City Council for consideration. If disapproved, the subdivider may appeal the commission's decision to the City Council within ninety days after the Commission's action. No person shall present testimony to the City Council that is substantially and materially different from that presented to the Commission, unless the party can demonstrate that the introduction of such evidence before the Commission was not in good faith reasonably possible at the time of the Commission meeting. If the Director does not agree that such evidence could not reasonably be presented at the time of the Commission meeting, the matter shall be referred back to the Commission for their review with the new information or evidence if it is found to be substantially or materially different from what had been presented. (Ord. 3799, §2)

(Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-25.5. Cluster Subdivisions.
Purpose: Cluster subdivisions may be approved which will result in improved living and working environments; which will promote affordable housing by reducing development costs and encourage a variety of dwelling types; which will support ingenuity and originality in total subdivision design; and which will preserve open space for recreational, scenic and public service purposes. To achieve these purposes:

a Variations in lot areas, widths, lot coverage and setbacks are permitted as long as overall dwelling unit densities established for the respective residential zoning district are not exceeded;

b Flexibility in the forms of property ownership and building types are allowed as long as only the uses in the particular zoning district are permitted;

Procedures are established to assure adequate maintenance and restricted use of open space areas for the inhabitant's benefit only or for dedication to public use; and

Procedures are established to assure adequate protection of existing and potential developments adjoining the proposed cluster subdivision.

Cluster Subdivision Standards: The minimum size of a lot of record within a residential cluster subdivision shall be:

a Three-thousand (3,000) square feet in the R-R (rural residential district) and R-l (single family district)

Two-thousand (2,000) square feet in the R-2 (two family district); and

One-thousand (1,000) square feet in the R-3 (multi-family district).

Cluster Open Space Requirements: All lot size reductions shall be compensated for by an equivalent amount of land permanently preserved as open space or common area; excluding parking lots, private drives, open storage areas or any land which has been or will be conveyed to a public agency under a purchase agreement or to meet the park land dedication requirements. The open space may be dedicated to the public in the manner prescribed herein or may remain in private ownership. If privately owned, the subdivider shall provide documentation satisfactory to the Director, Commission and City Council that the appropriate legal arrangements have been or will be put in place to assure its maintenance and preservation.

Cluster Subdivision Approval: Cluster subdivisions shall be considered as a major subdivision and shall be approved using the procedure outlined in Sec. 42-25.2., except that the sketch plan review shall be mandatory. The proposed cluster subdivision shall be consistent with the Rolla Comprehensive Plan and:

Will be adequately served by essential public facilities and services such as streets, sewerage, public water and electric supply, police and fire protection, and storm water drainage structures; or the person responsible for the establishment of the proposed cluster subdivision will provide these facilities and services;

Will provide usable and accessible open space for recreation or public use based on the size, shape, and topographic characteristics of the site; and

Will include open space with significant and irreplaceable natural and manmade features. (Ord. 3485)


Sec. 42-26. Requirements for Improvements, Reservation and Design.
In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the relevant laws, rules, and regulations, such as the City's zoning code, and regulations of the Phelps County Health Department and/or appropriate State agencies, Missouri Department of Transportation if abutting a State highway, and appropriate State and federal agencies. Subdivision lot lines shall conform to the municipal boundary lines when a subdivision abuts unincorporated land. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-26.1. Subdivision Name.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or sound like the name of any other subdivision, any existing or platted street, or any established business or development in Phelps County. Whenever final plats of a subdivision are approved in phases, each submittal for final approval shall be numbered consecutively. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-26.2. Streets.
(1) Conformity: The character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the Official Map or Major Thoroughfare Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their relation to proposed adjoining land uses. Where not shown on any map or plan, the arrangement and other design standards of streets shall conform to the provisions found herein.

(2) Relation to Adjoining Streets: The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the existing streets into the abutting subdivision or tract where appropriate.

(3) Projection of Streets: When a new subdivision adjoins unplatted or undeveloped land, new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of such tract. A temporary turnaround approved by the City Engineer shall be installed at this point unless the terminus of the new street is less than two hundred (200) feet from the intersecting right-of-way of an existing street.

All new subdivisions of twenty-five (25) lots or more shall be designed to provide at least two means of ingress and egress to the subdivision using a public street. The City Engineer may approve the use of dead-end streets abutting undeveloped property with the understanding that a connecting street will be constructed to provide ingress and egress once said abutting property is developed. (Ord. 3799, §3)

(4) Street Jogs Prohibited: Street jogs with centerlines offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be prohibited.

(5) Dead-end Street or Cul-de-Sac: Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall require a turnaround at intervals not to exceed six hundred (600) feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty-four (84) feet and a minimum property line diameter of one hundred (100) feet. If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, the City Engineer may require a similar turnaround along with provisions made for the future extension of the street. The City Engineer may approve alternative turnaround standards, such as "hammerhead" or "Y" configurations, if adequately designed to provide traffic circulation and better land use.

(6) Marginal Access or Service Streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing arterial street or highway the Commission may require marginal access streets or other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential areas and to separate through and local traffic.

(7) Minor Streets: Minor streets shall be arranged so as to discourage through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to all properties.

(8) Street Widths: The right-of-way width required to be dedicated and the pavement width required to be constructed shall be:

Street Type	Right of Way Width***	Pavement Width****
Cul-de-Sac	50'	30'
Lane*	50'	30'
Minor (Local)*	50'	30'
Collector**	50'	34'
Collector-Commercial	60'	34'
Arterial	80'	34'
Highway/Freeway	variable	variable
* Parking permitted on both sides of the street
** Parking permitted on one side only.
*** Greater right-of-way widths may be required as determined by traffic projections made
by the City Engineer for commercial or industrial areas.
**** Measured from the back of the curb.
(9) Low-Density Residential Subdivisions: In low-density, single-family residential subdivisions, pavement widths of minor streets not designed to accommodate through traffic may be reduced to twenty (20) feet. Sidewalks may not be required along minor streets. The City Engineer may waive requirements for curb and guttering if adequate provisions have been made for storm water drainage. The subdivision must comply with the following criteria:

(a) Overall density may not exceed one (1) dwelling unit per two (2) acres.
(b) Lot width abutting the street is not less than two hundred fifty (250) feet at the building line.
(c) In all other respects, street paving and related public improvements shall be provided in accordance with the design standards contained or referenced herein.
(10) Intersections: Streets shall intersect one another at as near a ninety (90) degree angle as is possible. No intersection of streets at angles less than seventy (70) degrees shall be approved. At each street intersection the property line at the block corner shall be rounded with a curve having a radius of not less than twenty five (25) feet. The intersection of more than two (2) streets at any one (1) point shall be prohibited.

(11) Subdivision into Tracts Larger than Ordinary Building Lots: Where a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, as determined by the Director, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and future subdivision.

(12) Curves: A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets, except for minor streets.

(13) Street Grades: The subdivider shall provide the City Engineer with development plans and drawings which show the grades of all streets and curbs within each subdivision. Street grades shall not exceed five (5) percent for arterial streets, seven (7) percent for collectors, and nine (9) percent for minor or lesser streets. No street grades shall be less than one-half (1/2) of one (1) percent.

(14) Reserve Strips: Reserve strips that control access to abutting streets and, as determined by the Director, do not provide sufficient area to be of practical use under the area's existing zoning classification, shall be prohibited except under conditions approved by the Commission and City Council or for double or reversed frontage lots.

(15) Parallel Streets: Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad or a limited access street right-of-way, the Commission may require the construction of a parallel street on one (1) or both sides of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use under present zoning of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grade separation.

(16) Half-Street Prohibited: Half-streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of a subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of this Article and with the approval of the City Engineer. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street right-of-way shall be platted within such tract.

(17) Street Names and Numbers: Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street names unless the new street is a continuation of, or in alignment with, the existing or platted street. In such cases, it shall carry the name of the existing street. Names shall be easily spelled and pronounced. Street addresses shall be assigned in compliance with the addressing system of the City.

(18) Access to Streets Across Ditches: The subdivider shall provide access from all platted lots to all proposed streets across drainage or other ditches in accordance with standards of the Public Works Department.

The access portion of such lots shall have a minimum width of forty (40) feet and not shorter than twenty-five (25) feet or longer than two hundred fifty (250) feet in length.

Flag lots shall not be further subdivided into additional lots unless a public right-of-way is dedicated and a street is constructed that meets City standards.

No more than one (1) flag lot may be platted from a single parcel or tract of land.

The building setback lines for flag lots shall be established on the building portion of the lot in accordance with the provisions of the particular zoning district. (Ord. 3799, §4).



Sec. 42-27. Deeding of Public Parks; Alternative Payment In Lieu of Parkland Deeding.
Sec. 42-27.1  Purpose.

The purpose of this section is to:

Provide an adequate level of public park facilities and services to new development and to ensure that such development occurs in a manner that is consistent with the components of the Citys comprehensive plan;
Define the obligation of developers to meet the public park and open space needs generated by new development.
Outline the provision of adequate parkland through the subdivision process.
Encourage the placement of parks within new residential developments or near or within a walkable distance of such developments;
Provide for the development of neighborhood or community parks by considering cash payment in lieu of parkland dedication.
Sec. 42-27.2  Applicability.

This provision shall apply to all residentially zoned subdivisions or re-subdivisions that have not been previously subject to parkland dedication or fee in lieu of. This provision does not apply to boundary line adjustments or lot consolidations. If, during the subdivision process, a rezoning is proposed for the same property, this provision will apply at the rate that is consistent with the newly proposed zoning district. This requirement shall be in addition to any private open space or recreation facilities designated for the sole benefit of the subdivision residents.

The applicant shall, as part of the final plat process, provide a warranty deed to the City in a form that is acceptable to the City or provide an equivalent fee-in-lieu payment, which will be for public use only.

Sec. 42-27.3  Parkland Dedication Requirements.

The area to be dedicated shall be clearly labeled and delineated on the subdivision plat and shall meet the following requirements:

Topography: At least 50 percent of the tract shall have a grade of less than four percent. The balance may be covered with slope, streams, ponds, or other natural features. Retention areas or detention basins which are required by the Citys storm water regulations, drainage easements, or water detention areas will not qualify for the parkland requirement.
Location: The parkland shall have access on a public street with a minimum frontage of 60 feet. Consideration shall be given to placing parks where they can be added to by future subdivisions or as an addition to an existing park.
Size and shape: The tract size shall not be less than one acre in size, unless, in the opinion of the Parks and Recreation Director and the Parks Advisory Commission, this land can be added to an adjacent existing park or future park.
Approval: The Parks Advisory Commission and the Parks and Recreation Director shall recommend the tract as suitable for use as a public park if the requirements listed above have been deemed satisfied before the plat can be approved by the City Council. The area of the tract shall be based upon a calculation using the following schedule:
Rural Residential:   5% of total residential area subdivided.
Single-family:        5% of total residential area subdivided.
Two-family:           5% of total residential area subdivided.
Multi-family:         7% of total residential area subdivided.
The percentage of land deeded shall be based upon the total area of the development or subdivision used for residential uses (lots), excluding any non-residential uses. Non-residential uses shall include such areas as right-of-way, dedicated conservation areas, or private amenities, provided there are no residences on these areas. The deeded land shall be free of liens, special assessments, and other encumbrances and shall have all taxes paid to the date of deeding. The Parks Director will provide a report to the appropriate City departments, the Commission, and the City Council for final determination that describes the suitability of the proposed land to be dedicated and the way in which the parkland dedication requirement was calculated and, if applicable, the way in which the fee in lieu of was calculated. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from using such deeded park property as allowed by Sec. 77.140 RSMo.

Sec. 42-27.4  Fee-in-Lieu Payment.

If the land available within the subject subdivision proposal does not meet the requirements and stipulations listed above in Section 42-27.3 or would produce less than one acre of ground, a fee in lieu of parkland dedication shall apply. The Parks Director will provide a report to the appropriate City departments, Commission, and City Council that confirms that a cash payment shall be paid by the applicant. The payment shall be calculated at a rate of $15,000 per acre of the parkland acreage requirements as calculated above. Any fractional parts of an acre shall be prorated. This rate will apply unless the developer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Parks Director and the Parks Advisory Commission that the current fair market value should be used.

All fee-in-lieu payments shall be deposited into the Parks and Recreation Land Escrow Account. The applicant shall deposit the required amount into this account without recourse or the right of recovery. Such cash deposit shall be made prior to the recording of the developments Final Plat Map and before the issuance of any building permits.

These cash payments shall be spent within five years of deposit and shall be used for the following purposes in priority as determined by the City Council with the advice and recommendation of the Parks Director and the Parks Advisory Commission:

Acquisition of neighborhood or community parks within one-half of a mile of the applicable subdivision.
Improvements to existing parks within one mile of the applicable subdivision.
Acquisition or improvement of larger regional or community-wide parks within two miles of the applicable subdivision.
The dollar amount per acre value established herein will be reassessed every five years based on undeveloped real estate values in the City of Rolla. A report and recommendation shall be presented to the City Council for their consideration. (Ord. 3485; Ord. 3622, §2; Ord. 3842, §1; Ord. 4419, §§1-9)



Sec. 42-28. Flood Areas.
Special provisions shall apply within Zone A on the City's Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, and within such parts of Zones B and C on said Maps as are required by the City Engineer to be protected.

Streets and Alleys: The subdivider shall grade and pave all new streets and alleys (if any) within the subdivision. All streets shall be bound by curb and gutter, unless exempted. It is the City's policy to participate in or contribute only to certain additional costs for the construction of collector or arterial streets over and above the normal construction costs for minor street standards, when such collector and arterial streets are identified on the Official Map, the Major Thoroughfare Plan, or when designated by the City Engineer. Such participation is not mandatory and is solely at the election of the City Council. (Ord. 3799, §6)

Sanitary Sewers: The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer connections for each lot. When sanitary sewers are not available, the subdivider shall install within the subdivision capped sewer mains and house connections to each lot in addition to other required onsite sewerage facilities. Prior to final approval of the plat, the subdivider shall provide the City Engineer, for his approval, detailed construction plans for the proposed sanitary sewer system.

Storm Sewers: Construction plans for storm sewer facilities shall be shown both in plan and profile with details of all necessary facilities. The data regarding the area to be served by the facilities and the estimated run-off from the area tributary to the facilities beyond the subdivision shall accompany the detailed plans.

Survey Standards and Monuments: The subdivider's surveyor shall establish, or confirm the prior establishment, of permanent monuments at each controlling corner on the boundary of the subdivision and at all block corners, point of intersections, points of curvature, and points of tangency within the subdivision before final plat approval by City Council. Monuments may be selected from the types described by the "Minimum Standards for Property Boundary Surveys" of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, but shall be made of concrete. In addition, the subdivider's surveyor shall establish at least two (2) permanent monuments as approved by the City Engineer for each block in the subdivision. Monuments shall be placed so as to create base lines in each block from which all points and lines in that block are laid out.

Permits: The subdivider shall be responsible for obtaining all applicable permits or licenses from state and federal agencies for sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and all utilities.

Sidewalks: Sidewalks may not be required on residential cul-de-sac (terminal) streets less then six hundred (600) feet in length. Sidewalks shall not be required in industrial subdivisions if zoned for that use or along State routes.

Where required, sidewalks shall have a minimum width of four (4) feet and shall be located at least three (3) feet from the edge of the curb. Sidewalks shall be installed as follows:

On one side of lanes and minor streets in subdivisions exceeding three (3) units per acre. The City Engineer shall designate on which side of the street the sidewalk shall be constructed.

On cul-de-sac streets, any required sidewalk shall either extend until it intersects with the bulb of the cul-de-sac, with a wheel chair ramp constructed to the street, or extended until it intersects with the first driveway within the bulb of the cul-de-sac.

On both sides of collector or arterial streets as shown on the Official Map or Major Thoroughfare Plan or as designated by the Commission.

The Commission may approve an alternative sidewalk plan, for example, in a Planned Unit Development, where the subdivider has submitted a proposed pedestrian circulation plan that provides more direct and safer movement of pedestrian traffic.

The City Council may also waive sidewalk requirements in developments targeted to providing affordable housing as determined by the Director.

Utilities: Utilities, including but not limited to water, sewer, natural gas, electric, and cable or telephone lines, shall be provided by the subdivider to the lots in accordance with the standards and specifications governing their installation as have been or are hereafter adopted by the City or respective utility companies. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to repair any damage caused in the public right-of-way as a result of this work. As part of the subdivision process, all easements in, on or across the subdivision, which shall be requested in behalf of the City Engineer or the General Manager of the City Municipal Utilities, shall be granted and shown on the final plat.

Underground Wiring: All electric, cable and telephone lines shall be installed underground, except those overhead distribution feeder lines necessary to serve that subdivision and in locations as approved by the City Engineer and Rolla Municipal Utilities. Cable switching enclosures, pad mounted transformers, and service pedestals may also be installed above ground where approved by the City Engineer and Rolla Municipal Utilities. The Commission may approve above ground installations in whole or in part for nonresidential subdivisions when documentation is provided that demonstrates the impracticability of such underground installation.

Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants shall be placed by the subdivider in accordance with the requirements of the City's Fire Chief, Rolla Municipal Utilities, and the state inspection bureau of Missouri. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-30. Subdivision Improvement Guarantees.
Before the final plat of any subdivision is recorded, the subdivider shall provide for the improvements described in this Article to be extended to all lots shown on the final plat at no cost to the City. In lieu of completion of the said improvements prior to recording, the subdivider or other person who agrees with the City to make public improvements on behalf of the subdivider, may post surety bond with one or more corporate sureties engaged in the business of signing surety bonds in Missouri, an escrow agreement, letter of credit or other appropriate security agreement, as approved by the City Engineer, that will insure that the improvements will be completed by the subdivider. The amount of corporate surety bond, escrow agreement, or other appropriate security agreement shall not be less than the estimated cost of the public improvements as determined by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may, during the period of such bond, accept substitution of principal or sureties on the bond or a substitution of a letter of credit, escrow or other approved security agreement.

The City Engineer may require that certain improvements, such as storm water facilities, be made and refuse to accept security for such improvements when he determines that the improvements are necessary for immediate protection of adjacent property. Otherwise, all improvements shall be completed within two (2) years after recording the plat.

The Commission, upon proof of hardship, may extend the completion date for improvements stated in the bond agreements for a maximum period of one (1) additional year; provided the request is made prior to the end of the second year following recordation and provided the security amount is revised if required by the City Engineer.

The Commission may also defer at the time of final plat approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any such improvements as, in its judgment, are not appropriate because of incompatible grades, future planned public improvements, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or other reasons.

For large subdivisions, the City Engineer may accept a bond or other agreement for less than the entire subdivision if the subdivider provides adequate assurances that all building permit requests will be confined to lots for which improvements will be provided under said bond or other agreement. (Ord. 3485)



Sec. 42-30.1. Release or Reduction of Security.
The release or reduction of required surety bonds, escrow agreement or other security agreement shall be in accordance with the following:

When a petition for improvements by the tax bill method is filed and when said petition has passed the required remonstrance petition assuring the City that all improvements will be provided, said bond or agreements posted by the subdivider may be released by the City Engineer.

The City Engineer may release or reduce said bond or agreements when he has determined that all or a portion of the required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and are free of any liens or other encumbrances. Any reduction in the bond or agreements shall not exceed the ratio of the cost of the completed improvements bears to the total estimated cost of all public improvements for the plat. (Ord. 3485)

For nonresidential subdivisions or mixed use developments, one (1) driveway shall be allowed for each two hundred (200) feet of frontage and shall, at a minimum, be located fifty (50) feet from the near right-of-way line of any intersecting street. Tracts less than two hundred (200) feet in width may share a common access with adjoining lots or take access from a minor street.

Arterial Streets: Access to existing properties fronting on arterial streets is subject only to design and construction standards. When new tracts or lots are created through the subdivision process with frontage on an existing or proposed arterial street, access shall be limited to one (1) driveway for each two hundred fifty (250) feet of frontage. Driveway entrances shall be at least two hundred (200) feet from the near right-of-way line of any intersecting street. Tracts of less than two hundred fifty (250) feet in width must either share a common access with adjoining lots or take access from a minor or collector street.

DIVISION 14. "PUD" PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT


Sec. 42-201. Purpose of the Planned Unit Development District.
The intent of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to encourage more creative, flexible, and imaginative land development than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is intended to permit, upon the approval of a Development Plan and subject to the procedures and standards in this Division, the creation of PUD Districts for any type of land use.

The suitability of each tract considered for PUD District designation shall be determined in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers, to promote health and the general welfare, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the over-crowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population, to preserve features of historical significance, to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water and sewerage service, schools, parks, and other public requirements, and with a reasonable consideration being given to among other things, the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the land throughout the City.

The procedures and standards herein established are intended to replace protections for substantive regulations in recognition that traditional density, bulk, spacing and use regulations, which may be useful in protecting developed areas, may impose inappropriate and unduly rigid restrictions on the development or redevelopment of parcels which lend themselves to an individual, planned approach. Approval of a PUD should promote the following goals:

Implementation of the Rolla Comprehensive Plan.
Efficient use of land that will protect and preserve, where possible, natural features of the land such as mature trees, streams, and topographic features.
Harmonious and coherent site and building design that create a sense of place.
Direction of development to areas where existing public transportation facilities, utilities, and pubic services are adequate; provided that the applicant may make provision for such facilities or utilities which are not presently available. (Ord. 3414)


Sec. 42-201.1. Effect of PUD District Approval.
The approval of a PUD District shall constitute an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Designation of a parcel as a PUD District shall supersede all existing and prior zoning classifications and requirements. Requirements, such as density, bulk, spacing and use regulations, may vary from, and be more or less restrictive, than the prior zoning classification. Such property shall for zoning purposes be identified as a PUD on the zoning map. (Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-201.2. Uses and Densities Permitted.
The Development Plan and application shall specify for the entire project and/or for sub-areas within a project, those permitted primary and accessory uses and development densities. The City Council may include or exclude uses or attach conditions to achieve the intent of these regulations. The Council may consider land use compatibility and relationships between uses in the project area, outside the project area in relation to the PUD District, and the appropriateness of permitted uses given their impact on the entire community. (Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-201.3. Application and Fee.
Prior to submitting an application and fee, the applicant may provide a sketch plan. However, in order to initiate the review process for the approval of a PUD District designation and the accompanying Development Plan, the applicant, who may be the property owner(s) or any person having a contractual interest in the subject property, or an agent of the applicant must submit a PUD application, a Preliminary Development Plan, and the PUD application fee found in the Fee Schedule in Section 42.143.1 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. A public hearing shall be held for such proposals and the Community Development Department shall notify the public of the hearing and proposal according to the prescribed procedures and standards described in Section 42-143 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. 

(Ord. 3414; Ord. 4401, §10-11)



Sec. 42-201.4. Procedure.

(c) Final Development Plan.

(Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-201.5. Sketch Plan.
A sketch or concept plan may be provided prior to filing a Preliminary Development Plan for review by the Community Development Director and other City department heads. (Ord. 3414; Ord. 3493, §6)



Sec. 42-201.6. Preliminary Development Plan Purpose and Intent.
The Preliminary Development Plan is intended to provide the applicant with the opportunity to submit information showing the basic concept, character and nature of the entire proposed PUD District without becoming involved in the preparation of a detailed plat or engineering drawings. It permits the developer to proceed with some assurance that a Final Development Plan will be approved. Developers may elect to forgo the Preliminary Development Plan step. Final Development Plans, however, must contain the same information required for Preliminary Development Plans.

Approval of a Preliminary Development Plan binds the applicant and the City with respect to the following development constraints:

(a) Categories of permitted uses;

(b) Overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of non-residential uses;

(c) General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems;

(d) General location and extent of public and private open space;

The number of off-street parking and loading spaces for each type of land use.

A phased PUD that extends beyond a single construction season shall include a development schedule stating the approximate beginning and completion date, the proportion of total open space to be provided, and the proportion of land uses to be constructed during each phase. All public improvements required for each phase shall be completed in sequence assuring adequate service for the PUD.

Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the subject property to complete the proposed PUD. Evidence would include a statement of all legal, beneficial, tenancy, and contractual interests held in or effecting the subject property. (Ord. 3414)


Sec. 42-201.8. Effect of Preliminary Development Plan Approval.
A Preliminary Development Plan, having been reviewed and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall not be modified, revoked, or otherwise altered pending the approval of a Final Development Plan by any action of the City without consent of the applicant. The applicant shall proceed to file a Final Development Plan, in accordance with the provisions in the following Section, with the Planning and Zoning Commission. (Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-201.9. Final Development Plan Purpose and Application.

Does not depart from the Preliminary Development Plan in any manner which the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall, based on the stated findings and conclusions, determine to materially alter the development concept for the proposed PUD. (Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-201.11. Effect of Final Development Plan Approval and Amendments.
Upon Final Development Plan approval by the City Council with or without modifications accepted by the applicant and upon application, all appropriate officials of the City may issue building and other permits to the applicant. The Community Development Director may authorize minor adjustments to the approved Final Development Plan when such adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or engineering considerations first discovered during actual site development. Otherwise, such an amendment will be classified as a major amendment to the Final Development Plan that must go through the entire PUD application and approval process as described in this Division. However, instead of the applicant being required to pay the full PUD application fee, the applicant must only pay the major amendment fee found in the Fee Schedule in Section 42.143.1 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. A public hearing shall be held for such proposals and the Community Development Department shall notify the public of the hearing and proposal according to the prescribed procedures and standards described in Section 42-143 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code.

ARTICLE III ZONING
DIVISION 16. CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

Sec. 42-234. Purpose of Conditional Use Permits
The conditional use permit procedure is designed to provide the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council with an opportunity for discretionary review of requests to establish uses or construct structures which may not be specifically allowed in a given zoning district, but may be deemed desirable or in the public interest to locate in that zoning district. The purpose of the review is to determine whether the proposed location of the use or structure is consistent with the overall intent of the zoning district regulations and to permit the imposition of conditions designed to minimize or mitigate potential adverse effects. Conditional Use Permits do not constitute a zoning change and only allow for a designated use, on a specific lot or tract, within the established zoning district. Conditional Use Permits shall not be required within the Planned Unit Development "PUD" District. (Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-234.1. Procedures.
In order for an applicant, who may be the property owner(s) or any person having a contractual interest in the subject property, to initiate the review process for the approval of a Conditional Use Permit, the applicant or an agent of the applicant must submit a Conditional Use Permit application, a site plan, and the Conditional Use Permit application fee found in the Fee Schedule in Section 42.143.1 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. A public hearing shall be held for such proposals and the Community Development Department shall notify the public of the hearing and proposal according to the prescribed procedures and standards described in Section 42-143 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. The application and site plan shall contain the information described below.

The Conditional Use Permit application shall contain the following information:

The names, addresses, signatures, and contact information for both the applicant and, if applicable, the agent of the applicant.

The legal description of the property;

The zoning classification and present use of the property;

A description of the proposed conditional use;

A Site Plan in accordance with this Section;

A statement describing how the proposed conditional use will comply with the applicable standards of this Section; and

A statement describing how the proposed conditional use is to be designed, arranged, and operated will be submitted in order to ensure that future development, which is consistent with District regulations, will not be prevented or made unlikely and that the value, use, and reasonable enjoyment of such property will not be impaired or adversely affected.

Site Plan content.

Approximate location of proposed and existing designated uses or buildings and other structures, including adjoining property, as well as parking and open areas shall be indicated for the proposed conditional use and adjacent property;

Existing and proposed contours at vertical intervals of not more than five (5) feet referred to sea level datum. Flood plain areas shall be delineated;

The applicant has demonstrated through the provision of a traffic impact study or other acceptable method that the proposed conditional use at the specified location will not adversely affect the safety of the motoring public and pedestrians using the facility and surrounding area from traffic congestion or other hazards.

The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning District regulations or the policies of the Rolla Comprehensive Plan. In determining whether the conditional use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to:

The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls, and fences on the site,

The nature and extent of proposed landscaping and screening on the site,

The noise characteristics of the use compared to the typical use in the District and any reduction solutions;

The potential glare of vehicles and stationary lights on site and any measures employed to mitigate their impact;

Sign location, type, size, and lighting, and

The impact on or potential interference with any easements, roadways, driveways, rail lines, utilities and storm water management systems. Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the standards set forth in this Article.

Adequate utility, drainage, and other such necessary facilities have been or will be provided.

The proposed uses where such developments and uses are deemed consistent with good planning practice; can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted developments and uses in the district; can be developed and operated in a manner that is visually compatible with the permitted uses in the surrounding area; and are deemed essential, convenient, or desirable to preserve and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City of Rolla.

Sec. 42-234.10. Procedure to Amend a Conditional Use Permit or Site Plan.
In order to amend an existing Conditional Use Permit or to amend the Site Plan approved for a Conditional Use Permit, the following procedures shall be executed:

To amend a Conditional Use Permit

The property owner or his/her/their agent shall submit a Conditional Use Permit Amendment application to request amendments to such a permit's conditions. The Community Development Director shall evaluate the request for consistency in purpose and content with the nature of the proposal as originally advertised for public hearing. A report shall be formulated that outlines the findings of such an analysis.

The Community Development Director shall then forward the request and his/her report to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission shall review the proposed amendments and file a report with the City Council in which the Commission shall recommend to grant, deny, or modify the requested condition amendments. If the Commission determines that the requested amendments are not consistent in purpose and content with the nature of the proposal as originally advertised for public hearing, the Commission may require that a new public hearing on the matter be held. If a new public hearing is ordered for the amendment, the amendment becomes a major amendment and the applicant must pay the major amendment fee listed in Section 42.143.1 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. A public hearing shall be held for such proposals and the Community Development Department shall notify the public of the hearing and proposal according to the prescribed procedures and standards described in Section 42-143 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code.

To amend the Site Plan:

The property owner or his/her/their agent shall submit a Conditional Use Permit Amendment application and an amended Site Plan in order for such an amended Site Plan to be considered for approval. The Community Development Director shall evaluate the request for consistency in purpose and content with the nature of the proposal as originally approved by the City Council.

If the Community Development Director determines that the proposed amendment to the Site Plan is not in conflict with the Final Site Plan and meets all conditions of the Conditional Use Permit, the Community Development Director may approve said amended Plan. The approved Site Plan shall be retained on file in the office of the Community Development Director.

If the Community Development Director determines that the amended Site Plan is not consistent in purpose and content with the Final Site Plan, the Community Development Director shall report this conclusion to the applicant and the Planning and Zoning Commission. In which case, the entire review process for the submittal of Conditional Use Permits shall be conducted for the amendment's approval. If the entire Conditional Use Permit approval process is required for the amendment, the amendment to the site plan becomes a major amendment and the applicant must pay the major amendment fee listed in Section 42.143.1 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code. A public hearing shall be held for such proposals and the Community Development Department shall notify the public of the hearing and proposal according to the prescribed procedures and standards described in Section 42-143 of the Rolla Planning and Zoning Code.

Sandwich Board Sign (Also known as A-frame sign): A type of freestanding, portable, temporary sign consisting of two faces connected and hinged at the top and its message is targeted to pedestrians. Includes a board sign on a stand instead of hinged.
Vehicular Sign: A sign affixed to a vehicle in such a manner that the sign is used primarily as a stationary advertisement for the business on which the vehicle sits or is otherwise not incidental to the vehicle's primary purpose.
Premises: The lot or lots, plots, portions, or parcels of land considered as a unit for a single use or development, whether owned or leased.
Projecting Sign (Also known as a blade sign): A building-mounted, double-sided sign with the two faces generally perpendicular to the building wall. Signs and banners that hang from a canopy, awning, or roof shall be considered projecting signs.
Revolving Sign: A sign which revolves in a circular motion; rather than remaining stationary on its supporting structure.
Roof Sign: A sign mounted on the main roof portion of a building or on the uppermost edge of a parapet wall of a building and which is wholly or partially supported by such building. When permitted, a roof sign will be considered a wall sign for the purpose of calculating maximum sign area.
Sign: Any device, structure, fixture, painting, emblem, or visual that uses words, graphics, colors, illumination, symbols, numbers, or letters for communicating a message. A sign includes the sign faces as well as any sign supporting structure
Sign Area or Face: The area of a sign enclosed by the perimeter upon which sign copy is placed. The computation details are described below:
Where the sign consists of individual letters, designs, or symbols that are attached individually and directly upon a wall without a change in color or appearance of the surface background, the area shall be that of the smallest rectangle which encompasses all of the letters, designs, and symbols.
In the case of panel or cabinet type signs, the sign area shall include the entire area of the sign panel or cabinet upon which the sign copy is displayed or illustrated, but not open space between separate panels or cabinets.
In the case of sign copy enclosed within a painted or illuminated border, or displayed on a background contrasting in color with the color of the building or structure, the sign face shall comprise the area within the contrasting background, or within the painted or illuminated border.
Only one side of a double-sided sign shall be considered when determining the sign area if the faces are equal in size and the interior angle formed by the faces is zero degrees.
Where the faces of a double-sided sign are not equal in size, but the interior angle formed by the faces is zero degrees, the larger sign face shall be used as the basis for calculating sign area.
When the interior angle of a double-sided sign formed by the faces is greater than zero degrees, all sides of such sign shall be considered in calculating the sign area.
The sign area for signs that are (or include) a three-dimensional object is calculated as the sum of two adjacent vertical faces of the smallest cube encompassing the sign or object.
Sign Copy: The letters, figures, characters, representations, pictures or wording on a sign, including any identification, description, symbol, trademark, object, design, logo, illustration, or device comprising the content or message of a sign; or any emblem or painting designed to advertise, communicate, identify, or convey information.
Sign Height: The vertical dimension of a sign. The computation details and relevant regulations are as follows:
Sign height shall be measured as the distance from the highest portion of the sign to the mean finished grade of the street closest to the sign. In the case of a sign located greater than 100 feet from a public street, height shall be measured to the mean grade at the base of the sign.
Clearance shall be measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign, including any framework or other structural elements that project from the wall.
Snipe Sign (Also known as bandit sign): A sign tacked, nailed, posted, pasted, glued, or otherwise attached to trees, poles, stakes, fences, public benches, streetlights, or other objects, or placed on any public property or in the public's rights-of-way or on any private property without the permission of the property owner.
Streamers: A display made of lightweight, flexible materials, consisting of long, narrow, wavy strips hung individually or in a series, with or without a logo or advertising message printed or painted on them and typically designed to move in the wind.

Wall Sign (Also known a fascia sign, parallel wall sign, or band sign): A building-mounted sign, which is either attached to or displayed on an exterior wall in a manner parallel with the wall surface. A sign or banner installed on a roof, eave, canopy, or awning in a manner parallel with the structures surface is also considered a wall sign. See projecting signs for signs that hang from such structures.

Externally lit signs shall be illuminated only with steady, stationary, and shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign. The illumination of signs shall not be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility. Illumination shall not exceed approximately 750 cd/m² or Nits at night. The illumination of signs shall not be of such intensity or brilliance as to impair the vision of a motor vehicle driver with average eyesight or to otherwise interfere with the driver's operation of a motor vehicle.
Roof Signs and Sign Placement. In no instance shall a wall sign or projecting sign project above the eave line or beyond a wall edge, except for roof signs in the C-3 and C-C zoning districts.

The minimum front yard setback for such signs shall be 15 feet from any public right-of-way, and/or private roadway easement. The maximum setback for such sign shall be 50 feet from the public right of way.
Restrictions for all highways:
External lighting of billboards, such as floodlights, thin line and gooseneck reflectors are permitted, provided the light source is directed upon the face of the sign and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed toward any residential structure or into any portion of the main travel way. The lights should not be of such intensity so as to interfere with the residential use of property or to cause glare, impair the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle, or otherwise interfere with a driver's operation of a motor vehicle.

(Ord. 3414; Ord. 4453, §21)

Sec. 42-244.9. Non-Conforming Signs.
Nonconforming signs are signs that do not conform to this Division, yet were legally established prior to the adoption of this Division. The burden of proof will be on the property owner to show that the sign was legally established. Nonconforming signs, including those existing pursuant to variances granted by the Board of Adjustment before June 1, 1999, may continue to exist after passage of this Division if they maintain their nonconforming status. Nonconforming signs will be removed and/or changed in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

Permanent signs and sign structures that are moved, removed, replaced, or structurally altered, as defined in the Definitions Section of this Article, must be brought into conformance with the sign regulations. However, nonconforming signs required to be moved because of public right-of-way improvements may be reestablished. Removable faces or sign panel inserts in a cabinet style sign may also be changed by right, and such change does not constitute a structural alteration nor trigger loss of nonconforming status.
Nonconforming temporary signs must be removed within 30 days of the passage of this language.
Once a sign is altered to conform or is replaced with a conforming sign, the nonconforming rights for that sign are lost and a nonconforming sign may not be reestablished.
Loss of nonconforming sign status.
If a sign is discontinued, it loses its nonconforming status. Except for signs that were legally established as Billboards according to state and/or federal law, a sign shall be considered discontinued if, for one year, the services or products advertised are no longer available at the destination or if the sign no longer has an advertising message other than the name of the sign owner on any part of the sign (Beginning dates of discontinuance can be validated by identifying the termination date of business licenses).
Destruction. When a sign or sign structure is removed or intentionally destroyed, replacement signs and sign structures must comply with the current standards. However, if a sign or sign structure that has nonconforming elements is partially or totally damaged by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner, the sign and sign structure may be rebuilt to the same size and height using the same materials.
Once a sign loses its nonconforming status, it must be removed before any other permits for signs shall be issued for the premises on which the sign that has lost its nonconforming status exists.
If structural alteration is needed to maintain the sign's structural integrity, the sign shall be removed and no building or sign permits shall be issued until its removal.
In cases of doubt or on a specific question raised whether a nonconforming sign exists, it shall be a question of fact decided by the Codes Administrator and such a determination shall be subject to appeal to the Board of Adjustment.

DIVISION 19. NON-CONFORMING BUILDING AND USE REGULATIONS


Sec. 42-247. Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.
Except as limited below and except for nonconforming signs, any structure or lawful use of any structure or land or part thereof that exists at the time of the adoption of this Article or an amendment thereto may be continued notwithstanding the fact that it may not conform to the provisions of this Article. The term structure includes accessory structures. Proof of lawful establishment must be provided by those who wish to continue such nonconformance. Signs abide by separate nonconforming structure regulations, which can be found in Subsection 42-244.9.

The following limitations apply to maintaining lawful nonconforming status:

an expansion or increase in intensity of a nonconforming use of land or structure or part thereof;
a change of use or a discontinuance of a nonconforming use of land or a structure or part thereof;

discontinuance of a use is defined as continuous vacancy or nonuse of land or structures or part thereof for a period of one year;

reconstruction, enlargements, additions, expansions, or structural alteration of a nonconforming structure, except for structural alterations that are required by building, fire, or health codes for human health and safety;

structural alteration is defined as any alteration to any component of a structure that supports any vertical load in addition to its own weight;
the modification of existing buildings is permitted by right if such changes result in greater conformance with the specifications of this Article;

structures that exist on lots that do not meet minimum lot size and width requirements render such structures nonconforming and, in turn, shall not be permitted to receive expansions or additions and the lots shall not be permitted to receive additional accessory or primary structures;
nonconforming structures shall not be moved unless they are moved in way that reconciles all nonconforming aspects of the structure that can be reconciled by moving the structure;
a nonconforming structure that is damaged by fire, tornado, or other catastrophe shall be permitted to be restored or rebuilt and used again as previously, provided that building permits for such restoration or reconstruction are issued within two years of the date of the catastrophe and are diligently prosecuted to completion and that the rebuilding or restoration following the catastrophe does not increase any nonconforming aspect of the original structure or use.

Exemption: Where reconstruction, alteration, extension, addition, or structural change to a single-family or two-family residential structure used for residential purposes does not increase any nonconforming aspect of the use or structure, a variance from the Board of Adjustment is not required for said alteration, reconstruction, addition, or structural change. Enlargements, expansions, and additions (including adding accessory structures) are not permitted if the lot does not meet minimum lot size and width requirements.

From the time of public notification for the adoption of the provisions of this division and afterward, the above limitations and other provisions of this Division will apply to all requests for building permits; to all change/establishment/increase of use requests, which includes such requests through the zoning approval of business license applications; and any other request that require land use review or building permits.

The Board of Adjustment, after a public notice and a public hearing, may grant a special exception to allow a legal nonconforming use to be changed to any other use permitted in the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is allowed, provided the proposed use is not more intense than the existing use in terms of traffic generation and other impacts on surrounding property.

The Board of Adjustment, after public notice and a public hearing, may grant a variance to allow a preexisting nonconforming use or structure to be expanded if, in the opinion of the Board, such expansion will not be more objectionable to or detrimental to the character of the neighborhood than the original preexisting nonconforming use or structure.

Sec. 42-255.2. Hearings.
Any interested party may appear at the hearing in person or by agent or by attorney. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to establish the facts necessary which the Board of Adjustment must find before granting any special exception or variance as herein contained. The Board of Adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in this Article to reduce, minimize, or mitigate the effect of such special exception or variance upon the property in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the intent of this Article. The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to decide in favor to affect any variance of this Article or to grant any special exception. No request or application to the Board of Adjustment shall be allowed on the same piece of property prior to the expiration of six (6) months from a ruling of the Board of Adjustment on any request or application to such body unless other property abutting or adjoining such property shall have within such period been altered or changed by a ruling of the Board of Adjustment, in which case such change of circumstances shall permit the allowance of an application, but such hearing shall be considered on its merits as in all other cases.

If the building permit or certificate of occupancy shall have not been issued within said ninety (90) day period or such extended period as the Board may specifically grant, then the special exception or variance shall be deemed waived and all rights thereunder terminated. Such termination or waiver shall be without prejudice to a subsequent appeal to the Board in accordance with the rules and regulations herein contained. (Ord. 3414)



Sec. 42-255.4. Special Exceptions.
The prospective occupant or owner of the property shall make application for special exceptions according to the terms of this Article and follow the application procedures outlined in Section 42-255.1 of this Division. Subject to the conditions and safeguards herein contained, after public notice and hearing, the Board of Adjustment may authorize special exceptions to this Article as follows:

The Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to allow a legal non­conforming use to be changed to any other use permitted in the zoning district in which the non-conforming use is allowed, provided the proposed use is not more intense than the existing use in terms of traffic generation and other impacts on surrounding property.

Permit the extension of an existing legal non-conforming use in a building upon a lot currently occupied as a legal non-conforming use.

Permit the use of property in the "R-1 " and "R-2" Districts adjacent to the "R-3", "C" or "M" Districts, even if separated therefrom by an alley or by a street, for parking of passenger cars under such safeguards and conditions of the setback requirements of the more restricted property, and further provided that such parking area shall not extend a greater distance than five hundred (500) feet from the "R-3," "C" or "M" Districts and other conditions as needed to promote public safety.

A variance from the applicable off-street parking requirements.

Sec. 42-255.6. Variance Standards.
The Board of Adjustment shall not vary the regulations of this Article as authorized above unless and until it shall make findings based upon the particular evidence presented to it in each specific case that:

That there are special circumstances or conditions applying to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or building and do not apply generally to lands or buildings in the same zone or neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this Article shall create an unnecessary economic hardship by depriving the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building, and;
That the alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property, and,
That the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively on a desire to enhance the value of the property, or increase the return or income therefrom, and;

DIVISION 22.  AMENDMENTS TO THE OFFICIAL ZONING DISTRICTS MAP  

SUBDIVISION IIa.  WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES CODE

Sec. 42-396.  Purpose.
Statement of Purpose.  The general purpose of this Division 22 ("Division") is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications Wireless Communications Facilities to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City of Rolla.  Specifically, this Division is intended to:
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Rolla;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of Wireless Communications Facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques that provide predictability for nearby property owners and others that future uses will not materially alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input from interested parties;
Ensure that any new Wireless Communications Facilities are compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and
Ensure that regulation of Wireless Communications Facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service and promotes the provision and availability of communication services within the City, and is no more burdensome than regulations applied to other types of infrastructure deployments.
Applicability; preemption. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this Division shall be applicable to all Wireless Communications Facilities existing or installed, built, or modified after the effective date of this Division to the fullest extent permitted by law. No provision of this Division shall apply to any circumstance in which such application shall be unlawful under superseding federal or state law and furthermore, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Division is now or in the future superseded or preempted by state or federal law or found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be automatically interpreted and applied as required by law.
