classifications and shall be made after review of prevailing rates for
comparable work in other public and private business, the current cost of
living, responsibilities of the position, and the policy of the Council.
Section 125.160. Administration Of Plan. [R.O. 1992 § 145.090;

minimum rate unless their qualifications are such that the City

such action is to the benefit of the City.

and accepts an assignment in a lower pay classification shall have his/
her salary be commensurate to the appropriate job classification.
C. Merit Increases. A merit increase is a payment granted to an employee
as a result of overall performance. The merit increase may be an
increase to salary. Merit increases shall be based upon performance
evaluations with the amount of merit increases, if any, fluctuating from
year to year. Performance evaluations will result in performance rating
which shall serve as the basis for the amount of the merit increase.
D. Dates Of Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations shall be
conducted at least annually; however, they may be conducted more
frequently at the discretion of the department head and/or the City
Administrator. All evaluations should be submitted to the Human
Resource Office at least sixty (60) days prior to the implementation of
the annual budget year commencing October 1. An employee must be
employed with the City for at least six (6) months prior to October 1 to
be eligible for any merit increase. Thus, any individual who is not
employed with the City prior to April 1 shall not be eligible for a merit
increase until the City's annual budget year commencing October 1 of
the year following commencement of employment with the City.

shall be required to record and document actual hours worked for each
period. Under no circumstances shall any employee record time worked
for any other employee other than himself/herself, nor shall any

be subject to immediate disciplinary action, which may include
dismissal. All alterations to an employee's official time card shall be
subject to the documented approval of the department head and the

Resource Office will promptly review and investigate the disputed
deduction to determine whether the deduction was improper and,
as soon as practicable, the Human Resource Office will provide a
written decision outlining whether the deduction was improper and
the reasons therefor. If the Human Resource Office, in response to
proper notification of the problem through the above-outlined
complaint procedure, concludes that the City has made an
improper deduction, then the City will promptly reimburse the
employee for the improper deduction.

compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times their regular

the maximum of forty (40) hours of compensatory time, and part or

employee shall not be eligible to accumulate any further
compensatory time during such calendar year. The employee will
be eligible to accumulate compensatory time in the following
calendar year up the maximum of forty (40) hours of compensatory
time. Any accumulated compensatory time not used by the

subsequent calendar year. If less than the maximum number of
hours of compensatory time is carried over to the subsequent
calendar year the employee may accumulate additional
compensatory time not to exceed a cumulative total of forty (40)
hours in that calendar year. The intent of this compensatory time
Section

policy is to assure that no employee has a personal bank of accrued
compensatory time in excess of forty (40) hours throughout
employment with the City and that no employee accrues
compensatory time in any calendar year once the employee has
accrued the maximum amount of forty (40) hours and thereafter
uses compensatory time during that particular calendar year.

for any reason will be reimbursed for accumulated compensatory
time with the normal payroll following the date of termination or
separation.
5. Requests to utilize accumulated compensatory time shall be
submitted to, arranged with, and approved by the department head
prior to the date on which the employee desires to take off. Use of
compensatory time shall not unduly disrupt the operations of the
City.
6. The foregoing policies regarding compensatory time do not apply
to exempt personnel or non-exempt salaried personnel.
7. Any disputes arising with respect to the accumulation of, or taking
of, compensatory time shall be decided by the City Administrator
whose resolution shall be final and binding.

that his/her conduct must improve or he/she will face more severe
disciplinary action. The employee is required to sign an
acknowledgment that the oral warning took place. A record of this
warning will be placed in the employee's personnel file, and the

be used for more serious infractions in lieu of an oral warning. The
department head should state, in writing, the nature of the infraction
leading to the disciplinary action and prior warnings, if any. The
warning/reprimand should include what improvement is expected, the
time limit for this improvement to occur, and consequences if the
improvement goal is not met. However, the failure to do so does not
affect the disciplinary measure issued by the department head. The
employee must read the warning/reprimand and sign it. A copy will be

turpitude casting doubt on the ability to perform the job
effectively.

attendance is an essential function for every job with the City.
Each employee is expected to be on the job ready to work at
the beginning of his/her scheduled shift. Unscheduled and
extended periods of absence are irresponsible and/or very
difficult to manage. This places an unnecessary burden on
other employees, and impairs the efficient operation of the
organization. For these reasons, records of absences, and late
arrivals and early departures will be maintained. Appropriate
disciplinary measures will be taken whenever an employee's
unscheduled or extended absence or tardiness becomes
excessive as determined by the City Administrator. Any
employee unavailable to work for an extended or indefinite

policy or a leave of absence would be considered a reasonable
accommodation under the ADA based upon the individualized

further defined by Missouri statute and/or City ordinance.
Unauthorized possession or use of a dangerous weapon shall
include specifically the wearing, transporting, storing, using,
brandishing or carrying of a dangerous weapon of any type,
concealed or unconcealed, upon the property of the City,
regardless of whether the employee is licensed to carry the
dangerous weapon. Unauthorized possession or use also
includes carrying a dangerous weapon of any type outside of
the City's property while acting within the course of
employment, regardless of whether the employee is licensed to
carry the weapon. Employees may not carry any dangerous
weapon while performing any task on behalf of the City or
while attending any function on behalf of the City. No
dangerous weapon shall be allowed on or within any Cityowned
vehicle or personal vehicle being used to conduct any

unauthorized possession or use of dangerous weapons is not
applicable to the use or possession of weapons by the Fire
Chief or by law enforcement personnel in accordance with
the policies, procedures and directives of the City's Police
Department or the use or possession of an object which may be
a dangerous weapon, such as a knife or dangerous chemical,
incident to performance of duties in the course and scope of an
employee's employment with the City.
q. Threatening or coercing any person employed with the City,
citizens or any elected or other official of the City.
r. Reasonable suspicion of the commission of a criminal act
occurring on or off the job which relates to job performance or
of such a nature that continuation of employment in the
assigned position could affect job performance or could
constitute negligence in regard to the City's duty to the public.
s. Using public office for private gain.
t. Reasonable suspicion of engaging in dishonest or immoral
conduct on or off the job that undermines the effectiveness of
the City's activities or affects relations with other City
employees or residents.
u. Failure or refusal to perform an assigned task.
v. Any conduct which involves harassment or discrimination
under any state or federal law or which constitutes
inappropriate conduct under the City's Equal Employment
Opportunity, Anti-Harassment and Non-Discrimination Policy.

reasonable accommodation, or inability to safely perform all
essential job functions, consistent with all federal and state
requirements under applicable disability discrimination laws.
x. Unauthorized disclosure of protected health information or any
information which is protected from disclosure by applicable
law or any information which is not deemed to be a public
record under the Missouri Sunshine Law (Chapter 610 of the
Missouri Revised Statutes).
B. The above are examples only of grounds for severe disciplinary action
and are not intended to be all inclusive. Law enforcement personnel are
subject to strict rules and standards of conduct as defined in the Police
Department Policy and Procedures Manual or its General Orders but
nothing contained therein shall supersede the provisions of these

observances, except as provided on the City's holiday schedule, will be
treated on an individual basis, and accommodation will be afforded so
long as such can be accomplished without undue hardship to the City's
operations.
A. Policy; Accrual.
1. It is the policy of the City of Washington to encourage all full-time
employees to take some time away from their job at least once
every year and enjoy the leisure time they need. Vacation leave
shall accrue to all full-time/active employees based upon their
years of continuous service with the City. Accrual of vacation shall
commence on employee's anniversary date. No vacation is
available during the employee's first year of service.
2. An employee may accumulate a maximum of one hundred sixty
(160) hours of vacation. Any excess over one hundred sixty (160)
hours will be forfeited.
a. After one (1) year of continuous service an employee is entitled
to eighty (80) hours of vacation.
b. An employee is entitled to one hundred twenty (120) hours of
vacation on his/her tenth anniversary date.
c. An employee is entitled to one hundred sixty (160) hours of
vacation on his/her fifteenth anniversary date.
3. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the City Administrator
may set or modify the rate of accrual of vacation leave for any

employee due to recruiting or other unique circumstances,
although such discretion shall generally be reserved for a
department head or management employee who is a direct report
to a department head, subject to the maximum annual accrual rate
of one hundred sixty (160) hours.
B. If possible, an employee shall request vacation at least two (2) weeks in
advance. Such requests shall be submitted to the department head and
the Human Resource Office. Department heads shall schedule vacation
leaves with particular regard to the operating requirements, order of
requests, and seniority of employees. The City encourages all
employees to take vacation in weekly allotments; however, vacation
leave may be taken for either one-half (1/2) of the number of hours
regularly scheduled as a workday for that employee or all of the number
of hours of a regularly scheduled workday for that employee at the
discretion of the department head and the approval of the Human
Resource Office. [For example, if the employee normally works an eighthour
day, the employee may take either four (4) hours or eight (8) hours
of vacation.] An employee on vacation who becomes ill or injured may,
upon proper notification, change status to sick leave, provided that
there is sufficient sick leave available.
A. Accrual of sick leave shall commence on the employee's anniversary
date. No sick leave is available during the employee's first year of
service.
1. A full-time employee with at least one (1) year of continuous service
is entitled to forty (40) hours per year.
2. A full-time employee is entitled to one hundred twenty (120) hours
per year on his/her fifth anniversary date.
3. Employees shall be allowed to accumulate sick leave up to a
maximum of one thousand four hundred forty (1,440) hours per
employee. Upon any separation from employment, the employee
shall have no right to payment for any sick leave earned but not
taken. Sick leave may be taken for either one-half (1/2) of the
number of hours regularly scheduled as a workday for that
employee or all of the number of hours of a regularly scheduled
workday for that employee at the discretion of the department head
and the approval of the Human Resource Office. [For example, if
the employee normally works an eight-hour day, the employee may
take either four (4) hours or eight (8) hours of sick leave.]
4. Holidays, vacation, personal sick leave, occupational illness,
emergency leave, and funeral leave (all as provided for in Article X
herein) shall not be deemed to be an interruption to continuous
service as used herein.

B. At any time, a physician's certificate may be required to verify the
employee's sickness or injury. Subsequent to an absence of any duration
due to sickness or injury, a physician's certificate may be required to
verify the employee's ability to return to work prior to resumption of
duties by that employee.
C. Advance Notice; Return To Work.
1. When an employee has advance notice of an impending physical
disability, such as elective surgery or pregnancy, the employee shall
notify the Human Resource Office so that it can be determined
whether an absence will qualify under the Family Medical Leave
Act. Upon request, the employee will be required to complete and
submit an FMLA Certification Form for such intended absence. If
the employee is not eligible for FMLA leave, such employee shall,
before commencing such leave, submit a statement from the
attending physician which shall include:
a. A description of the reason leave is needed.
b. The anticipated date that the leave should begin.
c. The date on which the employee will be able to return to work.
d. Whether the employee will or is likely to be under any physical
restrictions as a result of the illness or injury upon return to
work.
2. Such employee shall obtain a physician's release prior to returning
to work, and such release shall indicate whether or not the
employee is under any physical restriction and the nature of such
restriction.
D. Sick leave may not be used during any disciplinary suspension.
E. No employee shall be paid for any unused sick leave either during
employment or upon termination of an employee's employment.
F. Sick leave shall not be used by any employee except for the employee's
own illness, injury or medical appointments.
G. Nothing contained in this sick leave policy is to be construed as
guaranteeing employment status throughout the availability or use of
sick leave benefits or upon conclusion of any period of such leave. An
employee who is medically unavailable to work for any extended
duration may be separated from employment, consistent with
applicable federal and state laws, regardless of whether the employee
has exhausted all earned, unused sick leave.

In the event of the death of an immediate family member, a full-time
employee may be granted up to thirty-two (32) hours of paid leave to
attend the funeral of that family member. The amount of time granted
shall be based upon the recommendation of the department head and the
approval of the City Administrator and shall take into account such factors
as relationship, travel, and day of the week on which the services are held
and is not to be used for attending to matters pertaining to settlement of
the estate or business affairs of the deceased. "Immediate family" for the
purpose of this Section is defined as: spouse, child, brother, sister, parent,
father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandparent,
grandchild, stepchild, stepparent, stepbrother, stepsister or relative
permanently living in the same home. Attendance at funeral services for
someone other than those listed above shall require City Administrator
approval and shall be without compensation unless otherwise authorized.
A. An employee who has a work-related injury must notify the Human
Resource Office immediately. If the incident requires medical attention,
the Human Resource Office will direct the employee to a physician. If it
is an incident that requires emergency attention (life-threatening),
proceed to the nearest emergency facility for treatment and then the
employee must notify the Human Resource Office. In cases of
occupational injury or illness incurred in the performance of work or
employment with the City of Washington, the affected employee shall be
granted workers' compensation pay in accordance with State law. The
employee shall obtain a physician's release prior to returning to work,
and such release shall indicate whether or not the employee is under
any physical restriction and the nature of such restriction. Employees
may utilize accumulated sick leave, if available, in order to supplement
workers' compensation benefits to achieve full pay. Employees on an
extended and indefinite leave of absence, whether work-related or not,
have no guarantee of resuming active employment with the City if the
City's operations reasonably necessitate filling of such employee's
position following expiration of any available FMLA leave.
B. It is understood that any employee receiving workers' compensation
benefits pursuant to this Section agrees not to accept or perform any
work for any other employer or engage in any self-employment work
activity during the leave of absence; if an employee does so, the
employee acknowledges that in such circumstances the employee's
conduct will be deemed to be a violation of the terms of the leave of
absence, and that employment with the City will be considered to have
been terminated voluntarily on the employee's part as of the first day of
such a violation.

A department head, with the approval of the City Administrator, may grant
a full-time/active employee an extended leave of absence without pay not
to exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. Leave of absence may
be granted for medical reasons. Such leave shall be granted only after all
of the employee's accrued sick leave and vacation leave has expired. If
leave hereunder is granted because of an employee's medical condition,
an employee must, before being considered for leave, submit a statement
from his/her attending physician which shall include those items described
in Article X, Section 125.460, Personal Sick Leave, Subsection (C). Leaves
under this Section will only be granted when the granting of such leave will
not unduly burden the department affected and will not require that the
employee be replaced during said leave. This Section does not apply to the
extent a leave is governed by the City's Family and Medical Leave Policy in

An absence of an employee from duty, including any absence for a single day
or part of a day, that is not authorized by a specific grant of leave of absence
under the provisions of these rules shall be deemed to be an unauthorized
absence without pay. Any such absence by a non-exempt employee shall be
without pay and, in addition, may be subject to disciplinary action. Any such
full-day absence by an exempt employee may also be subject to disciplinary
action and without pay as authorized under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

employee who leaves the City for such military service may be paid
accrued vacation for which the employee is eligible from the City at the
time of the leave of absence.
B. Any employee who leaves his/her job to serve in the armed forces is
entitled to all rights provided for under Federal law during the
performance of military duty, and, upon completion of the military duty,
the employee is entitled to reinstatement to his/her former position or
to a position equal in terms of seniority, pay and status to the one the
employee left to go into the service unless the City's circumstances
have changed so much that it would be impossible for this to be done.
Those reinstatement rights are conditioned upon the employee fulfilling
the basic requirements for reinstatement under Federal law.

§ 145.300; Ord. No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
A. Except for the provisions of this policy regarding service member family
leave, an eligible employee is entitled to take up to twelve (12) weeks of
unpaid leave under this policy in a twelve-month period. Leave may be
taken for any of the following reasons.
1. To care for an adopted, foster care or newborn child;
2. To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent with a
serious health condition;
3. Because of an employee's own serious health condition that makes
the employee unable to work at all or perform the essential
functions of the employee's job; or
4. A qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the spouse, or a
son, daughter or parent of the employee is on active duty (or has
been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the
armed forces in support of a contingency operation.
B. An eligible employee is an employee who:
1. Has been employed by the City for at least twelve (12) months; and
2. Has worked for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250)
hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the
commencement of the requested leave.
C. For purposes of this policy, serious health condition means an illness,
injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
1. Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or
consequent to in-patient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,
hospice, or residential medical care facility;
2. Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, of more than
three (3) calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by
(or under the supervision of) a health care provider;
3. Continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care
provider for a chronic or long-term health condition that is
incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a
period of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days; or
4. For prenatal care.
D. The twelve-month period during which an eligible employee is entitled
to a total of twelve (12) weeks leave under this policy begins on January
1 of each year. Except for the provisions of this policy regarding service
member family leave, an eligible employee is only entitled to a total of
twelve (12) weeks leave in any given twelve-month period regardless of
Section
125.560
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.560
100:122
the number of qualifying conditions that may arise in any twelve-month
period.
E. For any leave taken in accordance with this policy that would otherwise
be unpaid, each employee is required to use accrued paid vacation,
accrued paid sick leave and accrued compensatory time to the extent
available in the following manner:
1. For any leave taken under this policy as service member family
leave or any leave relating to the placement of a child for adoption
or foster care, or to care for a family member with a serious health
condition, the employee is required to use all of his/her available
accrued paid vacation and then use all of his/her accrued
compensatory time while on leave; and
2. For any leave taken under this policy because of the employee's
own serious health condition, the employee is required to use all of
his/her accrued paid sick leave first, then use all of his/her accrued
paid vacation leave, and then use all of his/her accrued
compensatory time while on leave.
F. If the leave taken in accordance with this policy is compensated at all,
such as under the temporary total disability provisions of workers'
compensation law, then no use of accrued paid vacation, accrued paid
sick leave or accrued compensatory time will be required, but such paid
leave may be used at the employee's option.
G. Service Member Family Leave.
1. An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or
next of kin of a covered service member shall be entitled to a total
of twenty-six (26) workweeks of leave during a twelve-month period
to care for the service member (service member family leave). The
leave described in this Subsection shall only be available during a
single twelve-month period. During such a single twelve-month
period, an eligible employee shall be entitled to a combined total of
twenty-six (26) workweeks of FMLA leave, regardless of the reason
or reasons for taking FMLA leave. A "covered service member"
means a member of the armed forces, including a member of the
National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is
otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious
injury or illness. The term "outpatient status," with respect to a
covered service member, means the status of a member of the
armed forces assigned to:
a. A military medical treatment facility as an outpatient; or
b. A unit established for the purpose of providing command and
control of members of the armed forces receiving medical care
as outpatients.
Section
125.560
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.560
100:123
2. The term "serious injury or illness," in the case of a member of the
armed forces, including a member of the National Guard or
Reserves, means an injury or illness incurred by the member in line
of duty on active duty in the armed forces that may render the
member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's
office, grade, rank, or rating. For purposes of this policy, the term
"next of kin," used with respect to an individual, means the nearest
blood relative of that individual.
H. A husband and wife who are both employed by the City are permitted to
take only a combined total of twelve (12) weeks leave during a twelvemonth
period if the leave is taken: for the birth of a child or to care for
the child after birth; for placement of a child for adoption or foster care,
or to care for the child after placement; or to care for a parent with a
serious health condition. Each spouse is entitled to his/her own twelve
(12) weeks of leave during a twelve-month period if the leave is for his/
her serious health condition, or the serious health condition of the other
spouse or a child.
I. An employee's entitlement of leave to care for an adopted, foster care,
or newborn child expires at the end of the twelve-month period
beginning on the date of the birth or placement.
J. Employees seeking to use leave under this policy are required to
provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take leave if the need for
the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth or placement of a
child, or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the
employee or of a family member. If 30 days' notice is not practicable
under the circumstances, such as because of the lack of knowledge of
when leave will begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical
emergency, notice must be given as soon as practicable. The notice
under this Subsection must set forth the reason(s) for the requested
leave, the anticipated duration of the leave and the anticipated start of
the leave. When planning medical treatment, the employee must
consult with his/her department head and make a reasonable effort to
schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the department's
operations, consistent with the health care provider's medical
judgment.
K. When leave is taken because of the birth or placement of a child or
adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave intermittently or
on a reduced leave schedule only upon approval of the employee's
department head. When leave is taken to care for an employee's own
serious health condition or for a sick family member, leave may be taken
intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically
necessary at the employee's request.
L. An employee requesting service member family leave, leave to care for
the employee's seriously ill family member or leave due to the
employee's own serious health condition will be required to provide
medical certification of the need for the leave before the request will be
Section
125.560
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.560
100:124
approved. An FMLA Certification Form will be provided for such
purpose. The certification must be provided within fifteen (15) days of
the request, or the employee must provide a reasonable explanation
for the delay. The City will provide to the employee at or about the
time the request for leave is made a certification form to be given to
a health care provider for completion. After receiving the completed
certification form, the employee will be notified in writing of whether
the leave qualifies as FMLA leave or whether any clarification or more
complete or sufficient responses are needed regarding the information
on the submitted FMLA Certification Form before a decision on FMLA
leave request can be made. When an employee has taken FMLA leave
for the employee's own serious health condition, a doctor's release
authorizing the return to work must be provided before the employee
will be permitted to return to work.
M. It is understood that any employee taking family and medical leave
pursuant to this Section agrees that he/she will not accept or perform
any work for any other employer or engage in any self-employment
work activity during his/her leave of absence; if an employee does so,
he/she acknowledges that in such circumstances his/her conduct will be
deemed to be a violation of the terms of the leave of absence, and that
his/her employment with the City will be considered to have been
terminated voluntarily on his/her part as of the first day of such a
violation.
N. For the duration of any leave taken under this policy, the City will
maintain the employee's health care coverage on the same basis as
coverage would have been provided if the employee had not taken
leave. If an employee fails to return to work for the City for at least
thirty (30) days upon conclusion of leave taken under this policy, the
employee shall owe the City the cost of health insurance premiums
provided by the City during such absence, except as otherwise limited
by law.
O. When an employee takes leave, which would otherwise qualify as leave
under this policy except that the employee has not specifically
requested family and medical leave, the time spent on such a leave will
be designated as family and medical leave and be counted towards an
employee's total number of weeks to which the employee is entitled as
family and medical leave. For example, if an employee is on a leave of
absence due to a work-related injury or accident (workers'
compensation leave of absence), the leave of absence due to the workrelated
injury or accident will also be designated concurrently as FMLA
leave if it otherwise qualifies as FMLA leave.
P. Extended leaves of absence without pay that are not governed by this
policy, (i.e., those for a reason other than those provided herein, or if of
the type otherwise covered but which extends beyond the number of
weeks allowed hereunder), will be governed by Article X, Section
125.490, Leave of Absence Without Pay, of the personnel rules and
regulations for the City.

Grievances, Complaints And Appeals

Complaints. [R.O. 1992 § 145.375; Ord. No. 14-11283 § 1,
6-16-2014]
A. All eligible employees shall have the right, except as specified herein, to
utilize the grievance and complaint procedures of this Article. The
grievance and complaint procedures of this Article will be available to
eligible permanent, full-time, active employees who are not serving a
probationary period, whether imposed due to a new position or for
disciplinary performance reasons.
B. The City follows an open door policy. Employees are encouraged by the
City to raise any work-related concerns with their department head.
C. In addition, it is the policy of the City that all employees be treated in a
non-discriminatory fashion. Accordingly, the City requires that all
department heads discipline similarly situated employees in the same
fashion. At the same time, inasmuch as no two (2) conduct violations are
identical in every detail, no exact pattern of corrective discipline is
required and the City may deviate from its imposition of discipline
whenever it determines that such action is warranted under the
circumstances.
A. Step 1. A grievance or complaint must be taken to the department head
within seven (7) calendar days following knowledge of the occurrence.
Where possible, the grievance should be settled at this level. If informal
discussions do not resolve the issue, the matter shall be reduced to
writing by the employee and be submitted to the department head
within three (3) working days. The department head shall have five (5)
working days to respond in writing. In departments such as Police, and
others where a more involved hierarchy chain of command system is
utilized, the department head shall, through written, published
departmental rules and regulations, establish which immediate
supervisory level shall successively respond to a grievance.
B. Step 2. In the event that Step 1 does not resolve the situation, the
employee may forward all written documentation and appeal to the City
Administrator within three (3) working days of receipt of the
department head's decision. The City Administrator will provide a
decision to the employee within ten (10) working days of receipt of the
request. The City Administrator's decision shall be final.

Employment Policies
Section 125.720. Equal Employment Opportunity, Anti-Harassment
And Non-Discrimination Policy. [R.O. 1992 § 145.390; Ord. No.
14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
A. It is the policy and practice of the City to provide and promote equal
employment opportunities for all applicants and employees. It is the
responsibility of all employees to ensure that the concepts of equal
employment opportunity and non-discrimination are understood,
abided by, and carried out by everyone.
B. It is the policy of the City to hire, train, promote, compensate, and
administer all employment practices without regard to age, race, color,
genetic information, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex
or disability unrelated to the ability to perform a job. Discrimination or
harassment on any of the grounds stated above is strictly forbidden and
will not be tolerated. Because of the City's zero tolerance of offensive or
inappropriate sexual behavior at work, all employees must avoid any
action or conduct that could be viewed as sexual harassment. The City
will take appropriate measures in response to any such incidents which
are known by or reported to management or the Human Resources
Office.
C. The City believes that every employee has the right to work in an
environment free of sexual or other prohibited harassment. Such
conduct does not advance the purposes of the City; it is also morally
wrong, and may subject the City to legal exposure. Consequently, any
employee who engages in this prohibited conduct will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
D. Conduct Constituting Prohibited Sexual Harassment. Under guidelines
published by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature" constitute unlawful
harassment in the following instances:
1. When submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of employment; or
2. When submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as a basis for any employment decision (e.g., promotion, wage
increase, termination) affecting such individual; or
3. When such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
E. For example and without compiling an exhaustive list, the following are
illustrative of conduct that the City of Washington condemns and
prohibits under this policy:
Section
125.720
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.720
100:139
1. It is sexual harassment for any person to condition a benefit such as
a certain salary or promotion on the granting of sexual favors or the
establishment or continuance of a personal relationship, or to imply
to an employee that an award of such a benefit is conditioned upon
the granting of sexual favors or the establishment or continuance of
a personal relationship.
2. It is also sexual harassment for any employee to state or imply that
another employee's performance is attributable in whole or in part
to the sex of that employee.
F. Sexual harassment may involve such matters as crude sexual jokes or
sexual names; sexually suggestive, profane language; offensive sexual
flirtations and innuendos; a display of obscene or pornographic
material; sexual advances; grabbing or touching another individual; or
other, similar demeaning and insulting behavior based on sex.
Employees of the City should be aware that the issue of whether
conduct constitutes sexual harassment or discriminatory conduct may
depend on how that conduct is viewed by the employee who is
subjected to the conduct. Any employee who initiates or persists in this
prohibited conduct assumes the risk of violating this policy in the event
that the person who is the object of the conduct views it as offensive;
accordingly, such an employee may be subject to discipline even if the
conduct might not have been intended as offensive.
G. Prohibited Discriminatory Joking Or Epithets Based On Race, Ethnicity,
Sex, Religion, Age Or Disability. As examples, and without compiling an
exhaustive list, the following are illustrative of conduct the City
condemns and prohibits under this policy:
1. It is prohibited for any employee to bring any item to the work
premises for purposes of a racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, agerelated
or disability-related joke or epithet.
2. It is also prohibited for any employee to use City property, bulletin
boards, e-mail or voice mail systems, or documents for purposes of
a racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, age-related or disability-related
joke or epithet.
3. It is also prohibited for any employee to deface City property or the
personal property of anyone else for purposes of a racial, ethnic,
sexual, religious, age-related or disability-related joke or epithet.
4. It is also prohibited for any employee to utter or use any racial,
ethnic, sexual, religious, age-related or disability-related jokes or
epithets at work, or when referring to or about any other person, be
they an employee or a non-employee.
H. Procedure Upon Occurrence Of Prohibited Conduct. Any employee who
believes he/she has been subjected or exposed to any harassment or
other conduct prohibited by this policy has the right to have such
activity terminated immediately. Complaints must be made promptly to

the Human Resource Office. Complaints shall be treated in a
confidential manner to the extent reasonable. Retaliation of any form
against anyone who complains pursuant to this policy is strictly
prohibited. A prompt and thorough investigation shall be conducted
concerning any complaint. If the investigation leads to a determination
that the charges are true or there has been any improper conduct,
corrective action will be taken immediately. Such action may include
termination of employment for anyone violating this policy. In the event
of any complaint against the City Administrator, the Human Resource
Office shall investigate such complaint and issue a report of the
complaint and summary of the investigation of the complaint to the
Mayor and City Council for their review and determination of
appropriate action to be taken against the City Administrator.
A. The City stands committed to fulfilling its obligations under the
Americans With Disabilities Act. It is the policy of the City to hire, train,
promote, compensate, and administer all employment practices without
regard to a disability unrelated to the ability to perform a job with or
without reasonable accommodation. Discrimination against job
applicants or employees because they are disabled is prohibited and
will not be tolerated.
B. Guidelines. When dealing with situations involving job applicants or
employees with a disability, the City will endeavor to follow these
guidelines:
1. It is against the policy of the City to discriminate against qualified
individuals with disabilities who, with or without reasonable
accommodation, can perform the essential functions of a job.
2. The City is committed to ensuring that qualified individuals with a
disability are not discriminated against in applying for employment
and once such individuals have been employed in the workplace. It
is the policy of the City, where possible and readily achievable, to
make existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and
usable by individuals with disabilities. However, there may be
instances where the City is not aware that an employee has a
disability which might impact on an aspect of his/her employment
or whether an existing facility is accessible to and usable by
individuals with disabilities. It is incumbent upon any job applicant
or employee to alert the City as to the existence of a disability
which the job applicant or employee believes needs to be
accommodated so that he/she will enjoy and be afforded equal
employment opportunity in the workplace.
3. An individual may be considered disabled if he/she has a physical or
mental impairment and the impairment substantially limits one (1)
or more of the individual's major activities in life, has a record or

[R.O. 1992 § 145.400; Ord. No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
The Genetic Information and Non-Discrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from
requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or family
member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by this law. To
comply with this law, the City asks that employees not provide any genetic
information when responding to a request for medical information. "Genetic
information" as defined by GINA, includes an individual's family medical
history, the results of genetic services sought or received by an individual
(employee) or an individual's family member, and genetic information of a
fetus carried by an individual (employee) or an individual's family member
or an embryo lawfully held by an individual (employee) or family member
receiving assistive reproductive services.
history of such an impairment, or is perceived as having such
an impairment. The City is committed to making reasonable
accommodations in job duties, the work environment, and the
application process to enable a qualified person with a disability
to enjoy equal employment opportunities, so long as such
accommodations do not constitute an undue hardship.
4. At the same time, the City also has an obligation to provide a safe
work environment for all employees and its citizens and
community. Reasonable precautions will be taken to ensure that an
employee's disability, or any attempted reasonable
accommodations thereto, do not present a direct threat to the
health and/or safety of the individual employee with a disability or
to others.
C. Procedural Channels. An employee should advise the Human Resource
Office of the existence of a disability which the employee believes needs
to be accommodated so that he/she will have equal employment
opportunities in the workplace. The City will attempt to work with the
employee to determine if the employee's disability can be reasonably
accommodated. Employees also should advise the Human Resource
Office of any facilities which they believe need to be made accessible
and usable by individuals with disabilities. In addition, the employee
should contact the Human Resource Office immediately if he/she
believes that he/she has been discriminated against by reason of a
disability. Any complaint of disability discrimination shall be
investigated promptly and thoroughly and treated in a confidential
manner to the extent reasonable. If the investigation leads to a
determination that the charges are true, corrective action will be taken
immediately.

Wireless Telecommunications Usage Policy
Section 125.750. Statement Of Policy. [R.O. 1992 § 145.410; Ord.
No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
A. Assignment Of Equipment. The City may provide wireless
telecommunications equipment to employees who as part of their
employment have a regular and continuing business need for its use.
Such wireless telecommunications equipment may include cellular
telephones, pagers, and PDAs. Employees may be assigned wireless
telecommunication equipment by a department head when their duties
are determined to require frequent mobility but be readily accessible
and/or when their duties require them to be available for emergency
responses or consultation after normal business hours. Assignment of
wireless telecommunication equipment to an employee may be
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the City Administrator or
department head.
B. Purchasing Of Equipment. Wireless telecommunication equipment
must be obtained with the approval of the City Administrator. Only the
City Administrator has the authority to enter into contracts for service.
Department heads should work with the City Administrator to
determine the type of equipment that best suits the need, identify the
appropriate service vendor, and take advantage of the most cost
effective service contract and features. Typically, wireless
telecommunication providers are offering contracts that permit calls
under certain circumstances to be made at no additional charge.
Employees should remain aware of the terms of their contract so as to
take advantage of no cost calling opportunities rather than calling with
land line charges. Contracts may also place a maximum on the number
of minutes that can be used without incurring additional costs. The
service level should be set based solely on business needs, and the
employee must reimburse the City for any personal use that results in
additional charges.
C. Personal Use Of Equipment. Personal use of City assigned wireless
telecommunication equipment is permitted During normal business
hours personal use should be subject to the same limitations as that of a
land line. Such calls, e-mails or texts should be infrequent and brief and
made on the employee's own time, such as during breaks or lunch.
Personal use outside of normal business hours is permitted so long as
the employee reimburses the City for any additional charges incurred.
D. No Expectation Of Privacy. Employee communication via City-issued
wireless telecommunication equipment at all times cannot be
considered private. No employee shall have any expectation of privacy
in the use of the equipment, and no employee shall use the equipment
for any type of communication that is offensive, illegal, inappropriate,
or in violation of any City or departmental policy.
Section
125.750
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.750
100:143
E. Financial Responsibility. Employees may be financially responsible for
assigned wireless telecommunication equipment if the equipment is
lost or damaged as a result of the employee's negligence or not
returned within a specified period of time.
F. Use Of Equipment While Driving. Wireless telecommunications
equipment use should not occur while driving a City vehicle unless it is
an emergency. This does not apply to employees whose job
responsibilities include being in contact with dispatch. Where possible,
employees should send or receive communications when the vehicle is
not in motion or use a hands-free device. Telecommunications
equipment features such as pre-programming numbers, speed dial
functions, and voice mail should be set up. Under no circumstances
shall any employee while driving a City vehicle review any text
message, instant message or e-mail or create or send any text message,
instant message or e-mail.
G. Employee-Owned Equipment. Departments may restrict employeeowned
wireless telecommunications equipment during the workday and
ban them from job sites. Departments may develop additional wireless
telecommunications equipment policies and procedures for Cityassigned
equipment to meet specific departmental needs.
H. Emergency Contact Information. Employees whose job responsibilities
may require them to be contacted after hours in emergency situations
should supply the City with contact information, including the numbers
of any wireless telecommunications devices they might regularly carry.
Such information should not be considered to make the employee on
call or result in additional compensation outside of what may be
required under state or federal law.

Computer/Internet/E-Mail/Text Policy
Section 125.760. Statement Of Policy. [R.O. 1992 § 145.420; Ord.
No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
A. Applicability. The computer system, network, Internet and e-mail access
is the backbone of City operations and as such is an expensive
infrastructure that needs to be monitored and protected. This policy
applies to all employees and any other individuals who are provided
access to the City's computer system. Third parties should only be
provided access to the computer system as necessary for their business
purpose with the City and only if they abide by all applicable rules.
B. Computers.
1. The hardware and software that make up the City's computer
system and all data on the system are the property of the City. All
data, including electronic messages within the system, are the
property of the City and may be public records for the purpose of
retention or accessible via Missouri's Sunshine Law and Public
Records Law. The City purchases, owns, and administers the
necessary software and licenses and employees may not rent, copy
or loan the software or its documentation.
2. Computers may not be relocated to another office without the
permission of the City Administrator. Employees may not bring in
any personal computer or other device, including MP3 players, to
connect to the system without the permission of the City
Administrator.
3. Even the most innocuous games, screen savers, and popular
software have the capability of unknowingly introducing spyware,
viruses, and backdoor access to our system. As a result, no
software, applications, or modifications may be downloaded or
made to City-owned equipment. No instant messaging software
may be downloaded. Video streaming and audio streaming (such as
using the computer to listen to the radio) is prohibited unless
authorized by the City Administrator as it reduces available
bandwidth.
4. Employees should have no expectation of privacy in their use of any
City-owned equipment or computer system. The City may at any
time monitor, retrieve or recreate any files, calendars or computer
communications of any employee. Employees' activities on
computer devices are subject to review at any time.
5. Employees who leave employment with the City have no property
rights to contents of their e-mail messages or computer files.
C. E-Mail/Texts. The e-mail system is provided by the City for the purpose
of internal and external business-related communication. The system
Section
125.760
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.760
100:145
and all electronic messages within the system are the property of the
City of Washington. Texts sent through City-provided cell phones are
also the property of the City of Washington, and employees should have
no expectation of privacy regarding such messages.
D. E-Mail/Text Etiquette. Employees should be aware that while e-mail and
texting is a quick and convenient method of communication, once sent
the e-mail/text can be viewed potentially by the public, so sending or
forwarding of e-mail/text messages should be carefully considered for
appropriateness and good judgment. Humor is often contextual and
augmented by body language and so e-mail/texts may not be the most
appropriate method of transmission. Electronic discussion of topics
internally that begin to become controversial or involve significant
differences of opinion should be discontinued in favor of face-to-face
discussion.
E. Prohibited Uses Of E-Mail/Texts. The following e-mail/text uses,
including sending or forwarding communications, are expressly
prohibited:
1. Communications that are disruptive, offensive, abusive,
threatening or exceed the bounds of generally accepted standards
of good taste and ethics.
2. Communications of sexually explicit images or messages.
3. Communications that contain anything that might reasonably be
construed as harassment or disparagement of others based on
race, color, pregnancy, national origin, ethnicity, ancestry, sex,
sexual orientation, age, disability or religious beliefs (except as
may be specifically required as part of police reporting procedures,
including the statements of other parties).
4. Solicitation for commercial ventures, religious or political causes.
5. Any other use that may harm or compromise the integrity of the
City or be otherwise inappropriate to the City's organizational
philosophy.
6. Intercepting, eavesdropping, recording, or altering another
person's e-mail/text message without authority.
7. Attempting to send e-mail/texts anonymously or adopting the
identity of another person on any e-mail/text message, or using
another person's login, other than with permission.
8. Sending, downloading, or using information or software in violation
of copyright law.
9. Engaging in personal commercial activities, including offering
services or merchandise for sale.
Section
125.760
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.760
100:146
10. Engaging in any e-mail/text activity that would create liability for
the City of Washington.
F. Retention. Depending on the content of an e-mail message, it may be
considered a formal record and should be retained pursuant to a
departmental, City or Missouri record retention schedule. Accordingly,
e-mail messages should be written with care with the understanding
they may be public records. Employees should be aware that when they
have deleted a message from their workstation mailbox it may not have
been deleted from the server. The message may be residing in the
recipient's mailbox or forwarded to other recipients. Unless there is a
reason for archiving or retaining an e-mail, employees should delete
sent and received messages regularly as accumulation of files will
degrade system performance and response times. Employees and
departments are responsible for retaining and archiving their own
documents, e-mails and other records and should not rely on system
back-ups as an appropriate retention method. Since space is limited
and costly, employees should not be retaining personal e-mails,
documents, spreadsheets or photos on the system.
G. Internet. Access to the Internet is provided for work-related information
gathering and communication.
H. Prohibited Internet Usage. Accessing sites that are pornographic, are
commonly known as "hate" sites, promulgate violence or terrorism, or
allow gambling are inappropriate and expressly prohibited using Cityowned
equipment (except in the course of law enforcement purposes).
I. Personal Use. The City recognizes that occasional personal use of
computer equipment, cell phones, e-mail and Internet is desirable to
employees and overly tight restrictions are detrimental to morale and
unproductive to enforce. Such use should be limited to lunch and
outside of (before or after) work time and only if the equipment is not
needed for City business. Prohibited uses of e-mail and Internet
browsing are violations regardless of whether they occur during work
time, non-work time or during occasional personal use and are subject
to discipline up to and including termination. All uses of City
equipment, whether business or occasional personal use, are subject to
monitoring. Excessive personal use will be subject to discipline.
Employees should address questions on what constitutes excessive
personal use to their department heads.
J. Implementation And Administration Of Policy. It is the responsibility of
each individual employee to understand and comply with this policy. To
ensure the safety and uncompromised integrity of the system,
employees have the responsibility for reporting inappropriate use or
activities to their department head or IT. Department heads are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the policy within their
departments.

ARTICLE XVIII
Social Media Policy
Section 125.770. Statement Of Policy. [R.O. 1992 § 145.430; Ord.
No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
A. Overview.
1. With the rise of new media and next generation communication
tools, the manner in which employees of the City can communicate,
both internally and externally, continues to evolve. While this
creates new opportunities for communication and collaboration, it
also creates new responsibilities for our employees. This Social
Media Policy applies to all employees who use the following (which
is not intended to be an exhaustive list):
a. Social networking websites, examples of which include
MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube;
b. Blogs;
c. Instant messaging sites;
d. Wikis, such as Wikipedia and any other site where text can be
posted;
e. Web bulletin boards or chat rooms.
2. All of these activities are referred to as "Social Media Postings" in
this policy.
B. Scope Of Policy. This Social Media Policy covers an employee's personal
use of social media postings and the sanctioned use of social media
postings for City business purposes.
C. Personal Use Of Social Media.
1. This policy Section applies when an employee is using personal/
home computers or other personal devices. The City takes no
position on employees' decision to participate in the use of social
media postings. In general, employees who participate in social
media are free to publish their own personal information. An
employee should never use City computers or other City-issued
devices for personal social media postings.
2. Responsible Social Media Postings. Ultimately, an employee is
responsible for what is posted online. Before creating online
content, an employee should consider the risks and rewards that
are involved, including how social media postings may affect others
who perform services for or are employed with the City.
Harassment, intimidation or demeaning comments against such
persons on social networking sites may result in discipline up to
and including dismissal. Thus, the City encourages an employee to
Section
125.770
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.770
100:149
always be fair and courteous to co-workers, citizens, suppliers,
vendors or other people who work on behalf of the City. Also, an
employee should keep in mind that he/she is more likely to resolve
work-related complaints by speaking directly with co-workers or
by addressing the issue or problem with the department head
than by posting complaints to a social media outlet. Nevertheless,
if an employee decides to post complaints or criticism, he/she
should avoid using statements, photographs, video or audio that
reasonably could be viewed as malicious, obscene, threatening
or intimidating, that disparages guests, co-workers, citizens,
suppliers or vendors, that might constitute harassment or bullying
or might violate any applicable law. Examples of such conduct
include offensive posts meant to intentionally harm someone's
reputation or posts that could contribute to a hostile work
environment on the basis of race, sex, disability, age, national
origin, ethnicity, pregnancy, religion or any other status protected
by law or City policy.
3. Identification. If an employee chooses to identify himself/herself as
a City employee on any social media network, he/she must state in
clear terms that the views expressed are the employee's alone and
that they do not reflect the views of the City. Employees are
prohibited from acting as a spokesperson for the City or posting
comments as a representative of the City.
4. Honesty And Accuracy. An employee should ensure that he/she is
always honest and accurate when posting information or news. If
an employee makes a mistake, it should be corrected quickly. An
employee should be open about any previous posts that have been
altered. It is important to remember that the Internet archives
almost everything; therefore, even deleted postings can be
searched. Never post any information or rumors that are known to
be false about the City, co-workers, vendors, or others working on
behalf of the City. In short, the City expects its employees, when
commenting on matters related to the City's business, services or
programs, to exercise good judgment and common sense,
consistent with the City's values of honesty, integrity and ethical
behavior. Each employee should be mindful that any social media
posting may remain public for a long time if not indefinitely.
5. Right To Access. The City reserves the right to monitor social media
postings of employees. Any information that employees post on any
social media may be accessed by the City at any time, without prior
notice. The City prohibits taking negative employment action
against any employee for reporting a possible deviation from this
policy or for cooperating in an investigation. Any employee who
retaliates against a co-worker for reporting a possible deviation
from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Section
125.770
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.770

6. Prohibited Activity. Employees may not disclose confidential
information of any department, specifically including confidential
information relating to ongoing investigations, or disclose
confidential information of third parties who have provided
information to any department, including federal, state or local
security/safety information, or disclose private personnel
information or protected health information as defined in the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA). Employees are prohibited from posting, transmitting and/
or disseminating the likeness or images of any department logos,
emblems, uniforms and other material that specifically identifies
any department or the employee as a member of any department.
D. Use Of Social Media For City Business Purposes.
1. Social Media Uses. Social media provides a new and potentially
valuable means of assisting City departments and their personnel
in community outreach for problem solving, investigations, crime
prevention, recruiting, training, safety education and providing
public awareness of the activities of City personnel in serving and
protecting the interests of the City's residents and community.
2. Specific uses for City-sanctioned social media include but are not
limited to:
a. Time sensitive notifications related to road closures, special
events and weather emergencies.
b. Investigative tool for law enforcement when seeking evidence
or information about missing persons, wanted persons, crimes
perpetrated online such as cyber bullying or cyber stalking,
unsolved crimes through solicitation of tips and posting of
photos or videos of a crime by a participant or observer.
c. Alerting the public to the effective law enforcement services of
the Police Department and the effective rescue and fire
protection services provided by the City's volunteer Fire
Department.
d. Obtaining information as a recruitment mechanism for persons
seeking employment or volunteer positions with the City.
3. Rules Applicable To City-Sanctioned Use Of Social Media:
a. All social media postings are subject to all existing City
policies, including, for example, the City's Equal Employment
Opportunity, Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy,
Workplace Violence Policy, Computer/Internet/E-mail/Text
Policy and Wireless Telecommunications Usage Policy.

language, images or acts and statements or other forms of

sanctioned by the City. The City reserves the right to monitor
use of its devices or networks and to retrieve all social media
postings. The City reserves the right to block access from its
networks for social media postings at its sole discretion.
d. Employees may not disclose confidential information of any
department, specifically including confidential information
relating to ongoing investigations, or disclose confidential
information of third parties who have provided information to
any department, including federal, state or local security/
safety information, or disclose private personnel information or
protected health information as defined in the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
e. No employee shall divulge information gained by reason of his/
her authority, make any statements or publish any materials
that could reasonably be considered to represent the views or
positions of any department, without express authorization to
do so.
f. No information shall be disclosed which is likely to identify the
specific location or identification of any person subject to an
emergency call for law enforcement assistance.
g. No employee shall disseminate or transmit in any fashion
photographs or images of individuals receiving emergency
medical assistance. The City is the owner of any photographs
or electronic images taken by the Fire Department volunteers
or law enforcement personnel within the scope of employment
or volunteer service. Any such photographs or electronic
images must be turned in to the proper department authority.
h. The use of social media does not alter or change the
emergency or life safety report protocols currently in place.
Social media should not be used in place of the Emergency
Operations Center (9-1-1).
i. The establishment and use of any City-sanctioned social media
sites are subject to approval by the City Administrator and
applicable department head. All City social media sites shall be
administered by authorized administrators of the respective
department.
j. City social media sites should explicitly state they are
maintained by the City and that they follow the City's Social

n. The City will approach the use of social medial tools as
consistently as possible among different departments.
o. The City's website at www.ci.washington.mo.us will remain the

p. All City social media sites shall adhere to applicable federal,
state and local laws, regulations and policies.
q. Any content maintained in a social media format that is related

(excluding any information of a personal nature), posted
communication, and communication submitted for posting.
r. No employee should conduct political activities or private

Substance Abuse Policy
Section 125.780. Purpose. [R.O. 1992 § 145.440; Ord. No. 14-11283
§ 1, 6-16-2014]
Section 125.790. Statement Of Policy. [R.O. 1992 § 145.455; Ord.
No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
A. It is the policy of the City of Washington, Missouri, to maintain a safe,
healthy, and productive work environment for all employees and the
City's residents and to comply with the requirements of federal law and
regulations related to the Drug Free Work Place Act of 1988 and the
Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991. To that end, the
City will act to eliminate any use, possession, concealment, sale or
distribution of illegal or unauthorized drugs and alcoholic beverages
which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism, substandard
performance, poor employee morale, or tends to undermine public
confidence in the City's workforce. Generally, any substance which may
affect the employee's senses, motor functions, or alter the individual's
perception while working falls within this policy. This prohibition
applies during working hours and non-working hours if the off-duty use
impacts job performance.
B. This policy provides guidelines for the detection and deterrence of
alcohol and drug abuse. It also outlines the responsibilities of
management and employees. All employees covered by this policy
should be aware that violations of the policy may result in discipline, up
to and including termination. Applicants in violation of this policy will
not be hired.
C. In recognition of the serious duty entrusted to employees of the City
and with the knowledge that drugs and alcohol do hinder a person's
ability to perform duties safely and effectively, the following policy
against drugs and alcohol is hereby adopted by the City of Washington.
A. The use, possession, concealment, sale or distribution of unauthorized
drug or alcohol is absolutely prohibited. It is City policy that employees
shall not: report to work under the influence of alcohol or drugs; have
the odor of alcohol or drugs on their breath during a regularly
scheduled shift; possess drugs or alcohol on their person or property
under their control while on duty or on compensated standby time; sell
or provide drugs or alcohol to any other employees or to any person
while such employee is on duty; or work impaired as a result of the use
of alcohol or drugs.
B. The use of medically prescribed medications and drugs is not per se a
violation of this policy. However, failure by the employee to notify his/
her department head, before beginning work, when taking medication
or drugs which may interfere with the safe and effective performance of
duties or operation of City equipment may result in discipline, up to and

Ord. No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
including termination. In the event there is a question regarding an
employee's ability to safely and effectively perform assigned duties
while using such medication or drugs, clearance from a qualified
physician will be required.
C. The City has established a voluntary Employee Assistance Program
(EAP) to assist those employees who voluntarily seek help for alcohol or
drug problems. Medical insurance coverage for drug and alcohol
treatment may be included in the medical plan offered by the City.
Employees wishing to obtain more information on any of these benefits
should contact the Human Resource Office, the City's health insurance
carrier, or the Employee Assistance Program.
D. The City reserves the right to search, without employee consent, all
areas and property in which the City maintains joint control with the
employee or full control. All City vehicles are subject to search by
appropriate management personnel. Warrants will be obtained should it
become necessary to search areas beyond the City's immediate control.
E. Violations of this policy will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.
F. Employees reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcohol or
drugs shall be prevented from engaging in further work. The employee
shall be instructed to wait for a reasonable time until an authorized City
representative can transport the employee from the work site.
A. This policy shall apply to:
1. Personnel: All employees and applicants who are selected for
positions with the City of Washington.
2. Substances:
a. Alcohol;
b. Illegal or unauthorized drugs or any other substances which
may impair an employee's ability to effectively perform the
functions of the job or as otherwise described elsewhere in this
Substance Abuse Policy.
A. An employee must:
1. Not report to work or be subject to duty while his/her ability to
perform job duties is impaired due to alcohol or drug use, on or off
duty;
Section
125.790
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section

Section 125.820. Management Responsibilities And Guidelines.
[R.O. 1992 § 145.470; Ord. No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
2. Not possess or use, or have the odor of alcohol or drugs on his/her
breath during work hours, on breaks, during meal periods, while on
City property in an official capacity, or while operating any City
vehicle;
3. Not directly or through a third party sell or provide drugs or
alcohol to any person or to any other employee while either
employee or both employees are on duty or on call;

alcohol and/or drug analysis when requested by a department head
or his/her designee;
5. Notify his/her department head, before beginning work, when
taking any medications or drugs, prescription or non-prescription,
which may interfere with the safe and effective performance of job
duties or operation of City equipment;
6. Provide within twenty-four (24) hours of request a current valid
prescription for any drug or medication identified when a drug
screen/analysis is positive. The prescription must be in the
employee's name; and
7. Notify the Human Resource Office in writing of any criminal drug
statute or ordinances conviction or suspended imposition of
sentence for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than
five (5) calendar days after such conviction or suspended
imposition of sentence.
A. Department heads are responsible for consistent enforcement of this
policy. Any department head who knowingly permits a violation of this
policy by employees under his/her direct supervision shall be subject to
disciplinary action.
B. Department heads may request that an employee submit to a drug and/
or alcohol analysis when a department head has a reasonable suspicion
that an employee is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or
alcohol. "Reasonable suspicion" is a belief based on objective and
articulable facts sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent department
head to suspect that an employee is under the influence of drugs or
alcohol so that the employee's ability to perform the functions of the job
is impaired or so that the employee's ability to perform his/her job
safely is reduced.
1. For example, any of the following, alone or in combination, may
constitute reasonable suspicion:
a. Slurred speech;
Section
125.810
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.820
100:159
b. Alcohol on breath;
c. Inability to walk a straight line;
d. An accident involving City property or that results in the injury
of a person;
e. Physical altercation;
f. Verbal altercation;
g. Behavior which is so unusual that it warrants summoning a
department head or anyone else with authority;
h. Use or possession of alcohol or drugs;
i. Information on use or possession of alcohol or drugs provided
either by a reliable and credible source or independently
corroborated;
j. Arrest or conviction for a substance abuse offense or being the
subject of a criminal investigation into illegal drug possession,
use or trafficking; or
k. Evidence that the employee has previously tampered with a
drug test.
2. This list is not intended to be all inclusive of conduct which
constitutes reasonable suspicion.
C. Any department head who has reasonable suspicion that an employee is
impaired on the job by alcohol or other substance will immediately
arrange for a substance screening through the Human Resource Office.
If a screening is required after normal business hours, the department
head will make direct contact with the facility that has been designated
to perform screenings for the City. The following procedures shall be
followed:
1. The department head should document in writing the facts
constituting reasonable suspicion that the employee in question is
impaired on the job by alcohol or other substance.
2. Any department head requesting an employee to submit to a drug
and/or alcohol analysis shall be responsible for the employee's
transport to the City's designated facility where a drug and/or
alcohol analysis will be performed.
3. Any department head encountering an employee who refuses to
submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis upon request shall remind
the employee of the requirements and consequences of this policy.
Such continued refusal will constitute grounds for termination.
4. Department heads shall not physically search employees.

5. Department heads shall notify the Police Department when they
have reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee may have
illegal drugs in his/her possession or in an area not jointly or fully
controlled by the City.
6. Department heads shall not confiscate, without consent,
prescription drugs or medications from an employee.
D. Drug/alcohol tests are required for employees whenever there is a
pattern of on-duty accidents or an accident resulting in property
damage or bodily injury.
A. All applicants selected for positions with the City of Washington are
required to submit to a medical examination prior to their appointment
to a City position. As part of this medical examination, prospective
employees will be screened for a range of chemical substances.
Applicants will be informed during the interview process that substance
screenings will be given as part of the pre-employment medical
examination. Refusal to consent to and participate in such testing will
automatically disqualify the applicant from further hiring
considerations.
B. The drug analysis may test for any substance which could impair an
employee's ability to effectively and safely perform the functions of his/
her job. The type(s) of screening and the levels of substances, which
constitute a positive screen, will be determined administratively after
consultation with the City's medical services provider(s).
C. An applicant whose substance screen shows a positive result will not be
employed and will be disqualified from consideration for City
employment for twelve (12) months.
A. All City employees who perform job duties requiring a commercial
driver's license (CDL) are also subject to the rules of the Federal
Highway Administration (FHA) adopted pursuant to the Omnibus
Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991. A summary of those rules
and the City's program/policy is as follows:
1. Employees Covered. All employees of the City who hold commercial
driver's licenses (CDL) and all applicants for positions with
assigned duties that require a CDL are covered by the FHA rules
and regulations.
2. Prohibited Alcohol And Substance Abuse Related Conduct.
Employees required to have a CDL for their position are subject to
Section
125.820
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.840
100:161
the following prohibitions in addition to those defined elsewhere in
the City's Substance Abuse Policy:
a. No driver shall report to duty or remain on duty with a blood
alcohol concentration of two-hundredths percent (0.02%) or
greater.
b. No driver shall possess or use alcohol, including any
medication with an alcohol component, while on duty or while
operating a commercial motor vehicle;
c. No driver shall be allowed to drive within four (4) hours of
using alcohol;
d. A driver involved in an accident that requires an alcohol test
may not use any alcohol until after the test is completed or
eight (8) hours has elapsed;
e. No driver shall refuse to submit to any required drug or alcohol
test required by post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion
or follow-up testing requirements as defined below.
f. No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty when using
any controlled substances except those a physician has advised
that the driver may use which will not adversely affect the
driver's performance.
B. Types Of Tests. The City is required to administer the following types of
tests for persons operating commercial motor vehicles:
1. Pre-Employment Testing For Drugs And Alcohol. Offers of
employment are made contingent on successfully passing alcohol
and drug screening tests. This includes testing when a current
employee transfers into a position requiring the operation of a
commercial motor vehicle.
2. Post-Accident Testing. Drivers will be given drug and alcohol tests
within two (2) hours of an accident involving severe property
damage or bodily injury or an accident when the driver is cited for a
moving traffic violation.
3. Random Testing. Drivers must participate in random drug and
alcohol test pools. The random test rate of the alcohol testing pool
shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the drivers annually
and for the drug testing pool at least fifty percent (50%) of the
drivers annually. The tests will be spread throughout the calendar
year. "Random selection" means that an individual commercial
driver may be selected for alcohol and/or drug testing several times
in one (1) calendar year, or not at all.
4. Reasonable Suspicion Testing. Drivers are subject to drug and/or
alcohol testing at any time during, immediately prior to, or
Section
125.840
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.840
100:162
immediately after the driver's assigned working hours, when based
upon reasonable suspicion as defined in this policy.
5. Return To Duty And Follow-Up Testing. Before a driver who has
violated the prohibited conduct of this policy may return to work,
he/she must take and pass drug and/or alcohol tests. Follow-up
tests are to be given at least six (6) times within the first year after
the employee returns to duty following completion of a
rehabilitation program.
C. Testing Procedures.
1. Drug and alcohol testing procedures shall conform to those
required by federal regulations governing the drug and alcohol
testing mandated by the Department of Transportation. All drug
tests shall be done by a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
certified laboratory.
2. Specimen Collection.
a. The Human Resource Office will instruct job applicants to
report to the testing site. Current employees will be instructed
by the department head where and when to report for drug
and/or alcohol testing. In cases of post-accident or reasonable
suspicion testing, the employee will be transported to a
medical facility or the City will request and conduct a breath
test at the work site.
b. The procedure for collecting urine specimens will be designed
to ensure the integrity and identity of the urine specimen that
is produced. The procedure will also allow for individual
privacy; provided, however, that the City and employees shall
abide by the DOT Final Rule, effective August 25, 2008, which
provides additional safeguards against efforts of employees to
cheat on substance abuse testing, including a required
collection of urine under direct observation for certain returnto-
duty and follow-up tests. Breath alcohol testing will follow
federal procedures to ensure accuracy, reliability and
confidentiality.
c. If testing under this policy is ever required of an employee who
is in need of medical attention, necessary medical attention
will not be delayed in order to collect the test specimen.
However, such an employee shall promptly, upon request from
the City, provide the necessary authorization for obtaining
hospital reports and records and any other information at the
time the need for medical attention and/or testing arose.
3. Drug Testing. Drug testing will be performed on urine samples. The
initial test will be done by the Enzyme Immunochemical Assay
Method (EMIT) or a similarly approved testing method. All
specimens identified as a positive test on the initial test will be
Section
125.840
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.840
100:163
confirmed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)
techniques. A specimen will be treated as negative if the result
of the initial test or the confirmatory test is negative. All urine
samples will be split samples so that if the original specimen test is
positive the employee may request the retained sample be tested.
This request must be received by the MRO in writing within
seventy-two (72) hours of employee's notice of a positive result. The
split sample will be tested at the employee's expense. If the second
test is negative, the test will be deemed to be negative and the
cost of the test for the split sample will be paid for by the City or
reimbursed to the employee if already paid by the employee. Job
applicants do not have the right to split samples.
4. Alcohol Testing. Alcohol testing will be done by using Evidential
Breath Testing Devices (EBT) approved by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. Two (2) breath tests are required to
determine if a person has a prohibited alcohol concentration.
Breath alcohol testing requires the individual to provide a breath
sample. Should the initial breath sample have a result of twohundredths
percent (0.02%) blood alcohol content or greater, a
confirmation test will be conducted within twenty (20) minutes
using an EBT that prints out the results, date, and time, a
sequential number, and the name and serial number of the EBT to
ensure reliability of the results. A positive test will be reported to
the City only if the initial and confirmatory tests measure a blood
alcohol concentration at or above two-hundredths percent (0.02%)
by weight.
5. Refusal To Test. All employees covered by this policy are required
to submit to the alcohol or drug tests as provided herein. If an
employee refuses to be tested or alters or attempts to alter the test
sample, such actions shall be treated as a positive test in addition
to being a violation of this policy. Such a refusal is grounds for
immediate termination.
D. Test Results.
1. Drug Test.
a. The City's Medical Review Officer (MRO) will review positive
drug test results with the employee before they are reported to
the City to determine if there is a legitimate medical
explanation to account for the laboratory results. The Medical
Review Officer will report to the City whether an employee's
drug test was positive or negative. If positive, the substance(s)
for which the test was positive will be identified. The Medical
Review Officer may advise the City of a positive test result
without having communicated with the tested employee about
the test results if the employee expressly declines the
opportunity to discuss the results of the test, or if the employee
Section
125.840
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.840
100:164
cannot be reached after reasonable effort by the Medical
Review Officer.
b. If the Medical Review Officer determines there is a legitimate
medical explanation for the positive test result, the Medical
Review Officer will report the test result to the City as
negative.
c. Following a positive test result, the employee will be removed
from his/her safety sensitive function until, at a minimum: the
employee undergoes evaluation and, when necessary,
rehabilitation; after a substance abuse professional (SAP)
determines that the employee has successfully complied with
any required rehabilitation; and after the employee takes a
return-to-duty test with a verified negative test result.
2. Alcohol Tests. If an alcohol breath test results in a reading of twohundredths
percent (0.02%) to thirty-nine thousandths percent
(0.039%) blood alcohol content, the individual shall not return to
duty but shall be taken off-duty and not returned to work for at
least twenty-four (24) hours. If an alcohol breath test results in a
reading of four-hundredths percent (0.04%) blood alcohol content
or greater, in addition to the above, the employee must meet with a
substance abuse professional (SAP). The SAP will determine what
assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems
associated with alcohol use and when the employee may return to
work; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Subsection
shall in any way limit the right of the City to take disciplinary action
as it deems appropriate for any positive alcohol (or drug) test,
including immediate termination of employment.
3. Confidentiality.
a. The results of any positive test shall be kept confidential from
the general City work force and public. The results may be
known to the employee, test facility, the Medical Review
Officer and substance abuse professional and those
department heads and City administrative personnel as
deemed necessary. The City may use the results to determine
the appropriate response to employee drug and/or alcohol use
and to support its disciplinary or other actions or to defend the
City in a court or administrative hearing.
b. The Medical Review Officer, substance abuse professional and
the City shall not release the individual test results of any
employee to any unauthorized party without first obtaining
written authorization from the tested individual.
E. Actions Taken In Response To Test Results Or Refusal To Be Tested.
1. Refusal/what Constitutes Refusal. An employee who refuses to be
tested will be treated as having had a positive test. Failure to report
Section
125.840
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.840
100:165
to a collection site on a timely basis, sign any required consent
form, or otherwise fail to fully cooperate with the testing procedure
shall be treated as a refusal to be tested. An employee who fails to
report to work during a period in which random or other substance
abuse testing is being conducted, and under circumstances in
which the City reasonably believes that such employee has failed to
report to work for the purpose of avoiding substance abuse testing,
shall be deemed to have refused testing and treated as having
had a positive test. Employees refusing to be tested are subject to
immediate employment termination.
2. Positive Drug Test. An employee whose drug test result is reported
to the City as positive shall be immediately referred to a substance
abuse professional for evaluation and may be subject to
disciplinary action.
3. Alcohol Test.
a. An employee whose breath test results in a reading of twohundredths
percent (0.02%) to thirty-nine thousandths percent
(0.039%) blood alcohol content shall be removed from duty and
not returned to work for at least twenty-four (24) hours, and all
hours not worked shall be recorded as lost time. An employee
who has a continuing pattern of breath test results between
two-hundredths percent (0.02%) to thirty-nine thousandths
percent (0.039%) blood alcohol content shall be referred to a
substance abuse professional for evaluation and may be
subject to disciplinary action.
b. An employee whose breath test results in a reading of fourhundredths
percent (0.04%) blood alcohol content or greater
shall be removed from duty and not returned to work for at
least twenty-four (24) hours, and all hours not worked shall be
recorded as lost time. Additionally, the employee shall be
referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation and
may be subject to disciplinary action.
4. Subsequent Positive Test(s). An employee whose drug test result is
reported to the City as positive or whose breath test result is fourhundredths
percent (0.04%) blood alcohol content or greater and
who has previously had positive drug tests or previous breath tests
with a result greater than four-hundredths percent (0.04%) blood
alcohol content or who has previously been referred to a
rehabilitation program under the provisions of this policy shall be
subject to disciplinary action.
5. Rehabilitation. Failure to immediately begin an approved
rehabilitation program, successfully complete the program and/or
participate in required or recommended after-care may result in
disciplinary action.
Section
125.840
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
125.840
100:166
6. City's Right To Determine Discipline. The above notwithstanding,
the City has the right to take immediate disciplinary action for a
violation of this policy, including immediate termination of
employment for a single violation of this policy.
7. Return To Work — Conditions.
a. An employee who tests positive for illegal drug/alcohol use,
and who is not terminated from employment, cannot return to
work until he/she meets all of the following conditions:
(1) Successfully completes a City-approved rehabilitation
program as directed by the substance abuse professional
or as required by this policy;
(2) No further use of a controlled substance as indicated by a
negative drug/alcohol test result at the time of release;
(3) Obtains a full, written release and recommendation to
return to duty from the treatment facility doctor and/or
counselor;
(4) Continues to participate in any program of after-care
required by the rehabilitation facility doctor and/or
counselor;
(5) Agrees to be subject to post-rehabilitation unannounced
follow-up testing as determined by the substance abuse
professional after consultation with the City, for twelve
(12) months after reinstatement.
b. Return To Work — Drug Test.
(1) In order to recommend return to work after a positive drug
test, the MRO shall ensure the employee has subsequently
tested drug free, been evaluated by a rehabilitation
program counselor, and ensure the employee is in
compliance with rehabilitation conditions.
(2) The MRO shall determine whether and when a return to
duty recommendation shall be made for an employee who
has failed a drug test or refused to be tested and shall
determine the schedule for return to work drug testing.
(3) Only the Medical Review Officer may review and interpret
each positive drug test and after meeting with the
employee, report the results to the City.
c. Return To Work — Alcohol Test.
(1) In order to recommend return to work after an alcohol
test, which indicates a blood alcohol content greater than
four-hundredths percent (0.04%), the SAP must first
Section
125.840
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.840
100:167
evaluate the employee to determine whether the employee
has an alcohol problem.
(2) If the SAP determines that an employee has an alcohol
problem which requires assistance, the employee shall be
subject to counseling, treatment and follow-up alcohol
testing as directed by the SAP. Follow-up testing shall only
occur just before, during or just after the employee
operates a commercial motor vehicle.
8. Other Consequences. Besides the penalties set out by the City for
violations of this policy, the following consequences are required by
FHA rules:
a. No driver may drive if he/she has used a listed drug [marijuana
(THC metabolite), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates (including
heroin) and phencyclidine (PCP)], and no driver may drive
within four (4) hours of using alcohol or at any time when an
alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of fourhundredths
percent (0.04%) or greater.
b. A driver violating these rules may not return to work until
evaluated and released by a substance abuse professional and
subsequently tested for alcohol and drugs with negative
results.
c. A driver tested with an alcohol concentration greater than twohundredths
percent (0.02%) and less than four-hundredths
percent (0.04%) may not drive or perform other safety
sensitive functions for twenty-four (24) hours after the test.
d. Federal civil penalties for breach of the federal rules range
between one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.00) for each offense. Federal criminal
penalties for violations of the federal rules range between one
dollar ($1.00) and twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00)
for each offense or up to one (1) year imprisonment for each
offense.
F. Department heads have the following specific duties:
1. Department heads must produce drivers for post-accident drug and
alcohol testing within two (2) hours of the accident or explain in
writing why the driver was not produced. The driver may be given
necessary medical treatment and if such treatment prevents
normal drug or alcohol testing, the department head shall
immediately inform the Human Resource Office.
2. Whenever drug or alcohol tests are required under this policy,
department heads must produce the driver for those tests, and
when current impairment is reasonably suspected, the department
head shall not allow the employee to drive.

document early deterioration of job performance, the issues of drug
testing and prevention and educational strategies, including how to
implement them.
C. Notwithstanding any provision throughout the City's Substance Abuse
Policy in Article XIX, the City retains the right to administer discipline
as it deems appropriate for any violation of such policy. This means that
any employee, except for law enforcement personnel, testing positive
for substance abuse, refusing to submit to a required substance abuse
test or violating any other term of the City's Substance Abuse Policy
may be subject to immediate employment separation by the City
Administrator. Any demotion, termination or suspension of law
enforcement personnel shall be by the Mayor and Council in
accordance with Chapter 200 of the City Ordinances.

CDL holders and other employees in safety-sensitive positions when
testing employees who do not work in any safety-sensitive position.
E. Severability. The provisions of the City's Substance Abuse Policy are
severable and, if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional or
otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of
such court shall not affect any of the remaining provisions.

management, the driver's responsibility for his/her own training,
inspection, and maintenance of the vehicle he/she operates is necessary
for an effective safety program. A driver generally knows when a
vehicle should not be driven, whether it be due to lack of the driver's
ability and training or due to defective equipment.

1992 § 145.595; Ord. No. 14-11283 § 1, 6-16-2014]
The violation of any City safety rule or guideline shall be addressed in a
reasonable manner depending upon the severity of any violation. The goal
of adherence to safety rules and guidelines is to promote safety at all times
during employment with the City. In general, any violation of guidelines
will result in a safety reminder for the first violation. Multiple violations of
guidelines may result in more severe disciplinary action, including a formal
written reprimand, suspension or employment termination based upon the
offense and proximity in time to prior violations of any safety guidelines. A
first violation of any safety rule will result in a documented oral reprimand.
Subsequent violations of any safety rules will result in further disciplinary
action as deemed appropriate, which may include a written reprimand,
suspension or dismissal from employment, depending upon the severity of
the violation and proximity in time to any prior safety rule violations.
Section 125.960. Workplace Violence Policy. [R.O. 1992 § 145.600;

before making legal right turns at red signals.
b. When changing lanes, signal your plan ahead of time, yield to
passing vehicles (blind spots are not a valid excuse for an
accident).
c. When backing a vehicle, be sure no pedestrians are crossing at
the rear and look for small children in particular. A child's toy
nearby could mean a child is around the vehicle.
d. At expressway exit and entrance ramps be sure speed is
sufficiently reduced to avoid skidding on exit curves,
particularly under slippery conditions.
A. Overview. The City is concerned about the increased violence in society,
which has also filtered into many workplaces throughout the United
States, and has taken steps to help prevent incidents of violence from
occurring at the City. In this connection, it is the policy of the City to
expressly prohibit any acts or threats of violence by any City employee
against any other employee in or about the City's facilities or elsewhere
at any time. The City also will not condone any acts or threats of
violence against the City's employees, customers or visitors on the
City's premises at any time or while they are engaged in business with
or on behalf of the City, on or off the City's premises.

employees or visitors to the City's property who engage in such
behavior. Such action may include notifying the police or other law

procedures to secure the workplace from violence and to
reasonably protect employees from harm;

Section 145.080. Segregation Of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure,
as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall
separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt
material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies
provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to
the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to
inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe
the material exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of
the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.
Section 145.090. Custodian Designated — Response To Request For
Access To Records.
A. Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the
public and of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated attendance
by members of the public and at a time reasonably convenient to the
public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or
impractical. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special
access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.
B. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hours' notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public, the
nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes.
A. The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible
for maintenance and control of all records. The custodian may
designate deputy custodians in operating departments of the City and
such other departments or offices as the custodian may determine.
Deputy custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and
meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.
B. Each public governmental body shall make available for inspection and
copying by the public of that body's public records. No person shall
remove original public records from the office of a public governmental
body or its custodian without written permission of the designated
custodian. No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998,
grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise,
the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record unless
the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with, or
uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.
C. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon
as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third business day
following the date the request is received by the custodian of records of

a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain
format, the public body shall provide the records in the requested
format, if such format is available. If access to the public record is not
granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of
the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that
the record will be available for inspection. This period for document
production may exceed three (3) days for reasonable cause.
D. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon
request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is
denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of
the third business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.
A. Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body
shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish copies of public
records subject to the following:
1. Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted
under Section 32.091, RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($0.10)
per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) inches by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to
exceed the average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records
requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based
on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall
produce the copies using employees of the body that result in the
lowest amount of charges for search, research and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the
person requesting the records may request the public
governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public
governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester.
2. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films,
pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices and for paper copies larger than nine (9)
inches by fourteen (14) inches shall include only the cost of copies,
staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for
staff of the public governmental body required for making copies
and programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or
other medium used for the duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or

plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the
actual rate of compensation for the trained personnel required
to duplicate such maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is
required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may
include the actual cost of such programming.
B. Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of
copies.

attack unprovoked, to cause injury, or to otherwise threaten the
safety of human beings or domestic animals.
B. Notice. Within five (5) working days after classifying an animal as a

shall notify the animal's owner of such classification, in writing. The
notice shall identify the requirements and conditions for maintaining a
dangerous animal as set forth in this Section and Section 205.228. If the

submitting, within five (5) working days of notice of said classification, a
written request to the City Clerk or his/her designated representative

The confinement may be on the owner's premises or with a licensed
veterinarian.

to be a "dangerous animal" based upon evidence and testimony
presented at the time of the hearing, in addition to witnesses,
animal control personnel, Police or any other person possessing

informal and strict rules of evidence shall not apply. The owner may
be represented by counsel, present oral and written evidence, and
cross-examine witnesses.

or possessor of the animal found to be a "dangerous animal" shall

1. No animal may be declared a "dangerous animal" if the threat,
injury or damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was
committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises
occupied by the owner or keeper of the animal, or was teasing,
tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the animal, or has, in the past,
been observed or reported to have teased, tormented, abused or
assaulted the animal or was committing or attempting to commit a
crime.

to prevent subsequent incidences. This, however, does not exempt
the owner from being cited for other animal control ordinance
violations.

vehicle may seize the motor vehicle and notify the lessor that he/she
may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed and its vehicle
identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the
leased or rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has

such return is made more difficult or expensive by a defect in such
vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the lessee shall notify
the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the
expiration of the lease or rental agreement or within ten (10) days after

prosecute a suit in equity to enjoin the nuisance. If the court finds that
the owner of the room, building or structure knew or had reason to
believe that the premises were being used regularly for prostitution
activity, the court may order that the premises shall not be occupied or
used for such period as the court may determine, not to exceed one (1)
year.

from engaging in any prostitution activity anywhere within the
jurisdiction of the court.
D. Appeals shall be allowed from the judgment of the court as in other civil
actions.
94.Editor's Note: This Section previously noted that in prosecutions of prostitution and
patronizing prostitution, the sex (gender) of the parties was no defense. However, the
authorizing statute, former § 567.040, RSMo., was repealed without replacement by SB
491 in the 2014 Legislative Session, effective 1-1-2017.

towing company, as defined in Chapter 304, RSMo., provided the title
owner and lienholders, as ascertained by the Department of Revenue
records, a notice within the time frame and in the form as described in

school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as

shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is
upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a
speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different
roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway
containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a
loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or
controlled access highway at a point where pedestrians are not
permitted to cross the roadway.
A. The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the rightof-

Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from
opposite directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is
attempting to or is making a left turn.

road or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching
from the opposite direction when the making of such left turn would
create a traffic hazard.
E. Preferential right-of-way at an intersection may be indicated by stop
signs or yield signs as authorized in Section 304.351, RSMo.:
1. Except when directed to proceed by a Police Officer or trafficcontrol
signal, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop
intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked
stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching
traffic in the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.
After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway
or which is approaching so closely on the highway as to constitute
an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving
across or within the intersection.
2. The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience
to the sign slow down to a speed reasonable to the existing
conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if none, then at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching
traffic on the intersecting roadway. After slowing or stopping the
driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection
or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard during the time such traffic is moving across or
within the intersection.
F. The driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a highway from an alley,

A. No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State, or required to be
registered in this State, shall operate, register or maintain registration
of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle,
unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility which conforms
to the requirements of the laws of this State. No non-resident shall
operate or permit another person to operate in this City a motor vehicle
registered to such non-resident unless the non-resident maintains the
financial responsibility which conforms to the requirements of the laws
of the non-resident's state of residence. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the
owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such person
has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the
other's vehicle. However, no owner or non-resident shall be in violation
of this Subsection if he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a
motor vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall
mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in
any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury
to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident and in the
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
C. Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
1. A current insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle
insurer or by the Director of Revenue of the State of Missouri for
self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy, a motor
vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the
name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the
named insured, the policy number, the effective dates of the policy
and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five
(5) digits of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if
the insurance policy covers five (5) or more motor vehicles shall be
satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card; or
2. A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit
according to Section 303.240, RSMo.;
3. A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.; or

Section 382.150. Display Of False Evidence Of Insurance — Penalty
— Confiscation Of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer
knowing there is no valid liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle
as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the evidence of insurance is
illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance.
If the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator
for displaying invalid evidence of insurance, the Officer shall confiscate the
evidence for presentation in court. Any person convicted of violating this
Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 382.160. Alteration, Production Or Sale Of Invalid
Insurance Card.
No person shall alter an invalid insurance card to make it appear valid. No
person knowingly shall make, sell or otherwise make available an invalid or
counterfeit insurance card. Any person who violates this Section is guilty of
an ordinance violation.
4. A photocopy or an image displayed on a mobile electronic device as
authorized by and subject to the restrictions of Section 303.024,
RSMo.
D. Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the
insured motor vehicle or by the operator of the motor vehicle if the
proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator rather
than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall
exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the
officer's or inspector's duties.
E. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the
operator demonstrates to the court that he/she met the financial
responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at the time the
Peace Officer wrote the citation.
F. Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of
an ordinance violation.

Section
400.110
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.115
100:645
A. Intent And Purpose.
1. The purpose of the planned development districts is to provide a
means of achieving greater flexibility in development of land in a
manner not always possible in conventional zoning districts, to
encourage a more imaginative and innovative design of land
development, and to promote a more desirable community
environment.
2. The City Council, upon recommendation by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, may, by an ordinance adopted in the same
manner as a rezoning is approved, authorize a planned
development district when the proposed development or use of a
specific tract of land or area warrants greater flexibility, control
and density than is afforded under the general regulations of
standard zoning districts. These planned development regulations
are not intended to allow excessive densities, or the development of
incompatible land uses, either within the development or as the
development relates to the general neighborhood. The City Council
may, upon proper application, approve a planned development to
facilitate the use of flexible techniques of land development and
site design, by providing relief from conventional zoning standards,
in order to achieve one or more of the following objectives:
a. Site planning that better adapts to site conditions and its
relation to surrounding properties that would not otherwise be
possible or would be inhibited under the district regulations
applicable to the property;
b. Functional and beneficial uses of open space areas;
c. Preservation of natural features of a development site;
d. Creation of a safe and desirable living environment for
residential areas characterized by a unified building and site
development program;
e. Rational and economical in relation to public utilities and
services;
f. Efficient and effective traffic circulation, both within and
adjacent to the development site.
B. Relationship Of Planned Development Districts To Zoning Map.
1. A Mapped District. The PD designation is not intended to be
attached to existing zoning districts as an overlay. The PD
designation, as detailed in this Section, is a separate use district
and may be attached to a parcel of land through the process of
rezoning and Zoning Map amendment.
2. Plan Approval Required. It is the intent of this Chapter that no
development or redevelopment of the property encompassed by the
Section
400.115
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.115
100:646
PD designation take place until an acceptable development plan
has been reviewed and approved in conformance with the
requirements of this Section, Article XII, Amendments, and
applicable Sections of Chapter 410, Subdivision Regulations, of the
Washington Municipal Code.
C. Coordination With Article XII, Amendments, And Chapter 410,
Subdivision Regulations, Of The Municipal Code.
1. When a planned development involves any subdivision activity, the
subdivision review and approval procedure requirements
contained in Chapter 410 of the Municipal Code shall be carried
out simultaneously with the review of a planned development
under this Section of this Chapter. As applicable, reference is made
to requirements in Chapter 410 of the Municipal Code within this
Section. With regard to these references, said Chapter 410 may
contain the term "plat," which under the PD District requirements
is intended to be synonymous with "plan," as appropriate.
2. Since obtaining a PD District designation requires a map
amendment (rezoning), the requirements and procedures of Article
XII, Amendments, shall apply. As applicable, reference to Article XII
is made within this Section.
D. Types Of Planned Developments. An area approved for the PD
designation shall be assigned one of the following district
classifications, which shall be considered a separate zoning district and
subject to the specific restrictions and limitations outlined in this
Section:
1. Planned Development - Residential (PD-R): planned developments
involving residential uses only.
2. Planned Development - Commercial (PD-C): planned developments
involving commercial uses only.
3. Planned Development - Industrial (PD-I): planned developments
involving industrial and limited commercial uses only.
4. Planned Development - Mixed-Use (PD-MXD): planned
developments involving residential and limited commercial uses.
E. Permitted Uses. The permitted uses for all planned development
districts as provided for in Subsection (D) above are those as provided
for in Section 400.120(D) of this Article.
F. Minimum Planned Development Site Size.
1. The minimum site size for any of the planned development districts
shall be as follows:
Section
400.115
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.115
100:647
PD District Minimum Site Size in Acres
PD-R 1.5
PD-C 5.0
PD-I 10
PD-MXD 10
2. These minimum site sizes may be waived by the City Council upon
report by the Planning and Zoning Commission; if it is determined
that the use proposed is desirable or necessary in relationship to
the surrounding neighborhood; or if the City Council should
determine such waiver to be in the general public interest.
G. Density And Dimensional Regulations And Performance Standards.
1. General Standards.
a. The approval of the development plan may provide for such
exceptions from the regulations associated with traditional
zoning districts as may be necessary or desirable to achieve
the objectives of the proposed planned development. No
planned development shall be allowed which would result in:
(1) Inadequate or unsafe vehicular access to the development.
(2) Peak-hour traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the
adjoining or nearby streets. Capacity shall be based on a
street providing "level of service D" as defined in the latest
publication of Transportation and Traffic Engineers
Handbook, Institute of Transportation Engineers.
(3) An undue burden on public parks, recreation areas,
schools, fire and police protection and other public
facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the planned
development.
(4) A failure to comply with the performance standards
contained in Article V, Section 400.230.
(5) Other detrimental impacts on the surrounding area,
including, but not limited to, visual pollution.
b. In addition to the above requirements, all planned
developments shall be subject to the review criteria
established in Article V of this Chapter. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to clearly establish that the
above requirements are met.
2. Other Codes. All requirements of other codes and ordinances of the
City (e.g., Building Code) shall be applicable.
3. Planned Development - Residential (PD-R).
Section
400.115
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.115
100:648
a. Density. The density of residential development shall be
consistent with the intent of the original underlying residential
district(s). While the district regulations specify upper limits to
residential density, density of a planned development may be
limited to that which is established in the original residential
district or which is consistent and compatible with nearby
existing developed areas. Where an underlying residential
district does not exist, one must be determined and approved
by the Zoning Administrator prior to submitting a preliminary
development plan. Conversely, the density limits indicated in
the district regulations may be exceeded on portions of the site
within a PD-R District as long as the total site density limit is
not exceeded. This is referred to as "density transfer."
Additionally, the total site density may be exceeded up to a
limit, upon conclusion of the Planning and Zoning Commission
and the City Council that the density bonus provisions
contained in Subsection (G)(3)(c) below have been satisfied.
This is referred to as "density bonus."
b. Calculation Of Density. [Ord. No. 18-11899, 9-4-2018]
(1) The computation of density shall be based on dwelling
units per net acre for the entire site.
(2) To compute the number of dwelling units per net acre, the
net acreage should be divided by the lowest minimum lot
size of the underlying residential district.
(3) In situations where a proposed PD-R District overlaps two
(2) or more dwelling districts, density shall be calculated
separately for the portions of the PD-R District in each of
the original residential districts.
c. Density Bonus.
(1) The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend
and the City Council may approve an increase in density
within a PD-R District, up to a maximum of twenty percent
(20%), which shall be based on the precepts listed below.
The density bonuses shall be treated as additives and not
compounded.
Section
400.115
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.115
100:649
Maximum
Percentage
Increase Design Element
10% A minimum of an additional 5% of
the net development area devoted to
common open space (above the
minimum requirement) and
improved with public
pedestrianways, bike paths,
parkland, swimming pools, tennis
courts, community centers, club
buildings, etc.
5% Creative site designs and building
groupings, which take advantage of
natural terrain and resolve existing
on-site and off-site water runoff and
erosion problems. The provision of
storm drainage retention as a site
amenity is encouraged. Variations in
building design are permissible.
5% Creative use of landscape materials
and the provision of more extensive
landscaping than would otherwise
be required under the landscaping
requirements found elsewhere in
this Chapter
(2) If density bonuses (increases) are requested under this
Section, the applicant shall document all site amenities or
improvements for the City's review and consideration.
d. Development Phasing. If the sequence of construction of
various portions of the development is to occur in stages, then
the open space and/or recreational facilities shall be
developed, or legally provided for on a final plat, in reasonable
proportion to the number of dwelling units intended to be
developed during any given stage of construction as approved
on a final plat by the City Council. Furthermore, at no time
during the construction of the project shall the number of
constructed dwelling units per acre of developed land exceed
the overall density per net acre established by the approved
PD-R District.
e. Non-Residential Uses In PD-R Developments. Non-residential
uses are limited to those specifically listed in the dwelling
zoning districts. Such non-residential uses shall be subject to
all requirements for lot area, width, height, yards and setbacks
Section
400.115
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.115
100:650
prescribed in the district in which the proposed PD-R
development is located.
f. Common Open Space Requirements.
(1) Common open space shall comprise at least fifteen percent
(15%) of the gross area of the residential development or
be of a size equivalent to one (1) acre for each one hundred
(100) persons of expected population of the development,
whichever is greater. For purposes of this Subsection, the
expected population shall be determined by multiplying
the total number of dwelling units times two and five
tenths (2.5) persons per dwelling unit.
(2) Common open space shall be used for recreational, park or
environmental amenity purposes for the collective
enjoyment of the occupants of the development.
(3) In addition to the above open space requirements, the
following regulate the use of this common open space in
terms of physical surface characteristics, size, location and
physical improvements therein:
(a) Of the required common open space, up to one-half (1/
2) of it may be covered by water, floodplain,
stormwater detention/retention facilities or left in a
natural state.
(b) The area of each parcel of open space shall not be less
than six thousand (6,000) square feet in area nor less
than thirty (30) feet in its smallest dimension. In
addition, at least fifty percent (50%) of the common
open space shall be contiguous or connected via
pedestrian/bicycle paths or sidewalks.
(c) To the extent practicable, common open spaces should
be distributed equitably throughout the development
in relation to the dwelling units which such common
open space is intended to serve. The open space shall
not be isolated in one corner of a development but
shall be highly accessible (physically and/or visually)
to the residents of the development.
(4) Where common open space is to be provided in a
subdivided residential development, the use, operation,
and maintenance of areas for common open space,
common ground, and common buildings shall be
guaranteed by the establishment of a trust indenture
providing for such by a subdivision association or trustees.
Said indenture shall be approved by the City Attorney
prior to recording the indenture simultaneously with the
recording of the final plat.

400.115
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.115
100:651
g. Perimeter Buffer Requirements.
(1) Where a PD-R development proposes residential
development along the perimeter of the site which is
higher in density than that of an adjacent dwelling district,
there shall be a minimum thirty-foot-wide buffer area
meeting the requirements of Article IV, Section 400.190(I).
The buffer area shall be kept free of buildings or
structures and shall be landscaped or protected by natural
features so that all higher-density residential buildings are
effectively screened from the abutting lower-density
residential property.
(2) Where a PD-R development abuts a commercial or
industrial use or district, there shall be a minimum thirtyfoot-
wide buffer area meeting the requirements of Article
IV, Section 400.190(I). This buffer area shall be permanent
and landscaped and/or otherwise provided with screening
(i.e., sightproof fencing) so as to effectively screen the
commercial or industrial use from the PD-R development.

a. Site Coverage. Total site coverage by uses permitted in the PDC
or PD-I District shall be seventy percent (70%), except as
permitted to be exceeded in accordance with Subsection
(G)(4)(b) below.
b. Site Coverage Bonus. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may recommend and the City Council may approve an increase
in maximum site coverage from seventy percent (70%) up to
eighty percent (80%). In order to qualify for this bonus, the
development plan must demonstrate compliance with four (4)
or more of the following performance criteria:
(1) Incorporate storm drainage retention facilities as a site
amenity.
(2) Install storm drainage detention facilities underground.
(3) Increasing parking lot landscaping by fifty percent (50%)
more than otherwise required.

not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved. No change
authorized by this Section shall cause any of the following:
a. A change in the use or character of the development;
b. An increase in building or site coverage;
c. An increase in the intensity of use (e.g., number of dwelling
units);
d. An increase in vehicular traffic generation or significant
changes in traffic access and circulation;
e. A reduction in approved open space or required buffer areas;
or
f. A change in the record plat.
2. Plan Amendments. All proposed changes in use, or rearrangement

a revised development plan and be subject to the requirements of
this Section as if it were an entirely new application.
R. Failure To Initiate Construction After Final Development Plan Approval.
1. Period Of Validity. No approval of a final development plan shall be
valid for a period longer than two (2) years from the date of
approval unless, within such period, a building permit is obtained
and construction of a development's foundation is commenced.
2. Extension. The City Council may grant a one-year extension upon
written request of the original applicant if the application
submitted is substantially the same as the initially approved
application.
3. Lapse In Period Of Validity. At such time as the period of validity of
an approved final development plan lapses, the final development
plan and all uses, terms and conditions thereof may be declared
null and void, and the City Council may initiate proceedings to
rezone the site to its original or other appropriate zoning district in

Amendments.
A. Intent And Purpose. In order to establish a recognized system of
identification of land uses by both general and specific type, and to
provide a way in which to determine the category or use type that a
particular land use is within, the City of Washington is hereby adopting
Section
400.115
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.120
100:662
the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for its land
use designations. The NAICS was jointly developed by the United States
Office of Management and Budget through its Economic Classification
Policy Committee and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía
of Mexico and Statistics Canada. The most-recent version of the NAICS
is from 2012. However, as the nature of land uses change, this system
is updated from time to time and therefore subject to change. The mostrecent
published version of the NAICS will be the determining source
for the purposes of this Article of the Zoning Code.
B. Permitted And Special Uses By District. The land uses permitted by
right or subject to the special use regulations of Article V within each
district as set forth in Article III, Sections 400.055 through 400.115,
above are listed in the Washington Zoning District Land Use Table that
follows in this Section. In the NAICS, land uses are listed by two-digit
sectors, three-digit sub-sectors, and detailed use and sub-use listings of
four- to six-digit levels. The Washington Land Use Table herein provides
land uses primarily at four-digit levels (although a few three-digit subsectors
are listed).
C. Determination Of Uses Not Listed.
1. If a particular land use is being requested by a property owner for
development within a particular district and that use is not listed in
the table, then the NAICS is intended to be the determining source
for identifying the type of use by referring to the sub-sector data
from the NAICS listing to make such determination. However, the
ultimate determination of the permission of a use by right or by
special use permit will ultimately be controlled by the provisions of
Chapter 400 and other related Chapters of the Municipal Code that
apply.
2. In certain instances, the code designation in the table will be
indicated as "NF." This is used in instances where a particular use
does not readily translate to the NAICS system and where the land
use is defined in Article II of this Chapter.
D. Table Of Permitted And Special Uses. The Table of Permitted and
Special Uses is included as an attachment to this Chapter.

of the front yard heretofore established shall be adjusted in the
following manner:
a. When the building furthest from the street provides a front
yard no more than ten (10) feet deeper than the building
closest to the street, then the depth of the front yard for the
frontage is the average setback of the existing buildings.
b. When the situation differs from that in Subsection (A)(2)(a) and
is within one hundred (100) feet of an existing building on each
side, then the depth of the front yard is determined by a line
drawn from the closest front corners of these two (2) adjacent
buildings.
c. When the situation differs from that in Subsection (A)(2)(a) or
(b) and the lot is within one hundred (100) feet of an existing
building on one (1) side only, then the depth of the front yard is
the same as that of the existing adjacent building.
3. Where a lot is located at the intersection of two (2) or more streets,
there shall be a front yard on each street side of a corner lot, except
that the buildable width of such lot shall not be reduced to less than

Requirements. [R.O. 1992 § 400.190; Ord. No. 16-11557, 8-15-2016,
effective 3-1-2017]
A. Purpose And Intent. Green space and landscaped areas shall be
provided in order to create attractive transition areas between
properties; to minimize the impact of air, water and noise pollution; to
provide shade and reduce glare; to minimize the visual impact of solid
waste receptacles and other on-site storage areas; and to maintain and
enhance the natural features of the site. These regulations provide
standards and criteria for landscaping which are intended to enhance
the value of property, provide buffers between dissimilar uses, improve
the physical appearance of the City and maintain an ecological balance.
Maintaining and recreating an ecological balance is of increasing
importance because of the land coverage of pavement and structures.
These impervious surfaces create an increase in air temperature, water
runoff, flooding, erosion, water pollution and groundwater depletion.
Vegetation effectively alters these imbalances through oxygen
replacement, water absorption and abatement of noise, glare and heat.
Landscape methods which conserve water through the use of droughttolerant
plants and planting techniques are encouraged.
B. Applicability. These standards and criteria contained within this Section
are deemed to be minimum standards and shall apply to all new
construction occurring within the City except that of single-family
dwelling, two-family dwelling and agricultural zoning districts (R-1A,
R-1B, R-1C, R1-D, R-2, AG).
C. Enforcement.
1. The provisions of this Section shall be administered and enforced
by the Zoning Administrator or authorized representative.
2. If, at any time after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, it is
determined that the approved landscaping does not conform to the
standards and criteria in this Section, a notice shall be sent to the
owner citing the violation and describing what action is required to
comply with this Section. The owner shall have thirty (30) days
from the date of said notice to restore the landscaping as required.
If the landscaping is not restored within the allotted time, such
person shall be in violation of this Section. It is the responsibility of
the owner of the property that these requirements are complied
with.
D. Permits.
1. No permits shall be issued for the improvement of any site, the
construction of any building, or the establishment of any use for
which a landscape plan is required by this Section until such plan
has been submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator
or authorized representative.
Section
400.190
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.190
100:680
2. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building
or structure, all screening and landscaping shall be in place in
accordance with the landscape plan required below.
3. Temporary certificates of occupancy will be issued when seasonal
climates do not allow for the planting of vegetation. A landscape
plan shall be submitted and a schedule for completion shall be
established to be in conformance with the requirements of this
Section. Financial assurance must be given by the developer for the
estimated cost of the landscape plan.
E. Landscape Plans.
1. The landscape plan may be submitted concurrently with the site
plan or preliminary plat to the City Engineering Department. The
Zoning Administrator, or authorized representative, shall review
such plans and shall approve them if the plans are in accordance
with criteria set forth in this Section. If the plans are not in accord,
they shall be disapproved and shall be returned to the developer
accompanied by a written statement setting forth the changes
necessary to bring the plans into compliance.
2. Landscape plans shall contain the following information:
a. A minimum scale of one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet;
b. The location of all existing and proposed plant and landscaping
materials to be used, including plants or other landscape
features;
c. The person responsible for the preparation of the landscape
plan.
3. The landscape plan shall provide, to the maximum extent
practicable, for the preservation of existing trees. It is the intent to
discourage the practice of removing all existing trees in the
improvement or development of properties within the City.
4. Landscape methods which conserve water through the use of
drought-tolerant plants and planting techniques (known as
"xeriscape") are encouraged.
F. Maintenance. The owner of the property shall be responsible for
maintaining, in a neat and orderly manner at all times, the landscaping
required by this Section. Plant materials shall be maintained in a
healthy and growing condition that is appropriate for the season of the
year. Plant materials which die shall be replaced with a healthy plant
material of similar variety and meeting all requirements of this Section.

excessive use of such streets for parking and/or loading and unloading
of motor vehicles.
B. However, certain exceptions from these requirements are provided for
under special circumstances. These exceptions are provided as a
practical matter so as not to unduly limit the reuse of existing
developed properties by strictly imposing off-street parking space
standards. Even with the exceptions from the regulations contained in
this Article, it is not the intent to permit such exceptions that would
result in undue impacts of overflow parking from one use onto other
properties or public rights-of-way.
A. Construction Requirements.
1. Surfacing And Drainage.
a. Parking Areas. All open off-street parking areas and driveways
shall be graded and paved with a durable, dust-free and hard
material, such as bituminous hot mix or portland cement
concrete, or some comparable material. Off-street parking
areas for one-family and two-family dwellings shall be paved as
Section
400.245
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.255
100:703
specified above. All parking areas and driveways shall be
properly drained so as to avoid surface "puddling" or any
nuisance or damage to adjacent property.
b. Loading Areas. All loading spaces shall be improved with a
compacted select gravel base, not less than seven (7) inches
thick, and surfaced with an all-weather, dustless material, such
as bituminous hot mix or portland cement concrete, suitably
designed for intended use.
2. Perimeter Curbing. Except for parking areas accessory to onefamily
and two-family dwellings, fixed and permanent wheel
bumpers or curbs of concrete or comparable material at least four
(4) inches high shall be installed for each parking stall which is
located along the perimeter of any off-street parking area.
B. Vehicular Access And Circulation.
1. Access.
a. Access To Parking And Loading Areas. Off-street parking or
loading areas shall be provided with vehicular access via curb
cuts and access drives from an improved street or alley which
will least interfere with vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
Except for off-street parking accessory to one-family and twofamily
dwellings, such parking areas shall be designed to avoid
motor vehicles backing into public streets, alleys or sidewalks.
b. Access To Parking And Loading Spaces. Each off-street parking
and loading space shall be accessible directly from an aisle or
driveway. The only exception to this requirement is off-street
parking associated with residential dwellings (other than
apartment dwellings) and parking reserved exclusively for
vehicle sales, leasing, or rental.
2. Parking Area Delineations. All parking lots shall be striped to
provide a visible indicator for vehicle circulation and parking
maneuvers. Parking spaces and other circulation markings shall be
restored, as necessary, to maintain a clear identification of separate
parking stall spaces and other markings at all times.
3. Traffic Control. Vehicular traffic to, from and within an off-street
parking or loading area shall be controlled by appropriate traffic
control signs, surface markings and curb islands. All parking areas
which will, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, generate a
significant volume of traffic movement shall have their entrances
clearly marked and designated as to direction of traffic flow or
other conditions of use of the access driveway by the use of lowprofile
signs.
C. Location Of Parking Areas.
Section
400.255
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.255
100:704
1. All required off-street parking shall be provided on the same zoning
lot occupied by the use or building to which it is appurtenant,
except as provided for below.
2. In the event that there exist practical difficulties in satisfying the
requirement for parking spaces and/or if the public safety and
convenience would be adequately served by another location, the
Zoning Administrator may authorize an alternate location, subject
to the following conditions:
a. If parking is to be located elsewhere than on the lot on which
the principal use is located, then the "off-site" property to be
utilized for parking shall be in the same possession (either by
deed, or by easement, or long-term lease which has a term
equal to or exceeding the projected life or term of lease of the
facility) as the owner of the principal use. In addition, the
owner of property used for off-site parking shall be bound by
covenants filed in the office of the Franklin County Recorder of
Deeds, requiring such owner, successors, and assigns to
maintain the required number of off-street parking spaces
during the existence of such principal use utilizing the
property for parking.
b. Such off-site parking areas shall be located not more than
three hundred (300) feet from the nearest primary entrance to
the principal building being served, provided the lot for which
off-site parking is to be provided is located in a zoning district
that permits a parking lot or structure as a principal use. In
addition, such off-site parking areas shall not be located so as
to cause persons to cross an arterial street to get from said
parking area to the principal use which it serves.
D. Parking And Loading Area Setback Requirements.
1. Except as otherwise limited by the provisions of this Chapter,
parking areas, circulation aisles, and driveways may be located in a
required front yard, side yard, or rear yard.
Exception: Where no building setback is required by this Chapter,
or where a parking area is be located adjacent to a similarly zoned
property and cross-access is provided between the two properties,
the five-foot setback requirement shall not apply to the crossaccess
drive.
2. On lots developed with one-family or two-family dwellings, no
motor vehicle shall be permitted to be parked between the dwelling
and any street unless such vehicle is parked upon a driveway. Said
driveway shall conform to all of the following standards:
a. The driveway shall not be wider than forty percent (40%) of the
width of the lot on which the driveway is located or thirty-six
(36) feet, whichever is less;
Section
400.255
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.255
100:705
b. The driveway shall not cover more than forty percent (40%) of
the required front yard; and
c. In all instances, no vehicle shall be parked so as to have any
portion of the vehicle located over a public or private sidewalk
or pedestrianway.
E. Dimensional Standards.
1. Parking Areas. Except for off-street parking associated with onefamily
or two-family dwellings, and as otherwise provided in this
Section, the minimum dimensional requirements shown in Figure 1
shall apply to all off-street parking areas.
2. Loading Areas. The area of loading berths or spaces shall be at
least twelve (12) feet in width and at least twenty-five (25) feet in
length [forty-five (45) feet for tractor/trailer loading berths],
exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and shall have a vertical
clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet.
3. Exceptions To Dimensional Standards:
a. Additional aisle width and turning radii may be required to
accommodate emergency vehicles and equipment, or where
the aisle serves as a principal means of access and circulation
within the site, including access to loading spaces, drivethrough
facilities, or trash storage facilities.
b. If the desired parking angle is not specified in this Section, the
Zoning Administrator may specify other equivalent dimensions
associated with the desired parking angle by interpolating
from dimensional standards specified in this Section.
c. The Zoning Administrator may authorize a reduction in the
vehicle projection (stall depth), as specified in this Section,
where parking stalls front along the curbed perimeter portion
of the parking area (without wheel stops or bumpers). This
reduction shall only be permitted where such a reduction will
not result in an obstruction to pedestrians on adjacent
sidewalks and where there is sufficient clearance between the
curb and the vehicle overhang. The reduction shall comply
with the dimensional limitations contained in Figure 2. [Ord.

d. Vehicle stacking lanes (queuing or waiting area for drivethrough
facilities) shall be a minimum of eleven (11) feet by
twenty (20) feet per required stacking space.
e. A ninety-degree compact car stall dimension of not less than
eight (8) feet by seventeen (17) feet may be used for off-street
parking that is in excess of the minimum required parking
spaces as set forth in this Article. To the extent possible, such
smaller parking spaces shall be located in a single contiguous
area that is clearly marked for use by compact vehicles only.
Aisle widths associated with allowable compact car parking
spaces shall be the same as required in this Section.
f. Off-street parking spaces for vehicles, other than personal
passenger vehicles, shall be of a size (exclusive of aisle, drives
and maneuvering space) sufficient to accommodate the length
and width of the vehicle as well as the opening of vehicle doors

Section 400.260. Supplementary Off-Street Parking And Loading
Regulations. [R.O. 1992 § 400.260; Ord. No. 16-11557, 8-15-2016,
effective 3-1-2017]
A. Determination Of Required Number of Spaces.
1. Employees. Employees, when used as a measurement for
determining the number of parking spaces, shall be based on the
number of employees that can be expected to be on the premises
during the largest shift. The number of employees shall be based on
the use activity operating at full capacity.
2. Floor Area. Except as otherwise described in the minimum offstreet
parking and loading spaces (Section 400.265), the term
"floor area," as employed in this Article, shall include the sum of the
area of horizontal surfaces of all floors of a building, measured from
the exterior faces of exterior walls, less the floor area devoted to
elevators, stairwells, mechanical rooms, restrooms, and areas
devoted to off-street parking or loading.
3. Uses Not Specifically Established On Site Plan Or Not Listed In
Schedule Of Required Parking. If there is any uncertainty with
respect to the amount of parking space required by the provisions
of this Article as a result of any indefiniteness as to the proposed
use of a building or of land, the maximum requirement for the
general type of use that is involved shall govern. In the event that a
development proposal includes uses not specifically listed in the
Schedule of Required Parking and Loading, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine the number of required parking
spaces based on the similarity of such use(s) to other uses
contained in Section 400.265 of this Article.
4. Fractional Parking Spaces. When application of the schedule of
parking requirements as hereinafter provided calls for a certain
number of parking spaces plus a fraction of a space, then such
fraction shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number to
determine the number of spaces required.
B. Handicapped Parking.
1. The Zoning Administrator may require a specific number of
handicapped parking spaces to be sized and located to allow safe,
accessible vehicle parking for the physically handicapped. The
number and design of such spaces shall not be less than standards
established by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and any
standards for such design established by the Missouri Department
of Transportation. The following minimum standards shall be
applicable:
a. Handicapped parking spaces shall be twelve (12) feet in width
and twenty (20) feet in depth and marked with the
international symbol for disabled parking spaces.
Section
400.260
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.260
100:709
b. A handicapped parking space shall be situated preferentially
within the general parking area. Additionally, it shall be in a
location which affords maximum safety and minimum exposure
or risk to the disabled individual in traversing the path from
his/her vehicle to the store or other facility which is his/her
public destination.
c. The parking space shall be designated as reserved for the
handicapped by a painted symbol on the paved area and shall
be further designated as such with signage at a point four (4)
feet above the paved surface so as to be clearly visible to the
driver of any vehicle attempting to park in the space provided.
C. Parking For Multiple-Use Buildings. The number of parking spaces
required for land or buildings used for two or more purposes shall be
the sum of the requirements for the various uses, computed in
accordance with this Article. Parking facilities for one use shall not be
considered as providing the required parking facilities for any other
use, except as provided for in Section 400.265 of this Chapter.
D. Prohibited Off-Street Parking Activities And Uses. The following offstreet
parking uses are expressly prohibited:
1. Off-street parking of vehicles or vehicular parts or accessories in
violation the Washington Municipal Code.
2. The use of recreational vehicles for living, sleeping or
housekeeping purposes when parked or stored in a dwelling zoning
district.
3. Trucks and trailers designed and manufactured for or used for
specific commercial purposes, including, but not limited to,
wreckers, dump trucks, tracked vehicles, buses, construction
vehicles and equipment vehicles and equipment carriers, bottling
works delivery trucks, grain trucks and refrigerated trucks, are
prohibited from parking in all residential districts as provided for in
Article III of this Chapter. Vehicles (excluding mobile homes,
recreational trailers, boats and recreational vehicles) licensed to
haul in excess of twenty four thousand (24,000) pounds are not
permitted. No mobile home, etc., may be parked in a front yard, as
defined in Section 400.180(A) of this Chapter, for a total of thirty
(30) days in a calendar year. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Subsection (D)(3) of this Section, any type of
commercial vehicle, regardless of licensed or gross vehicle weight,
delivering or picking up merchandise for delivery or employed in
performing a repair or construction service may park for the
purpose of making such pickup or delivery or for the duration of the
period during which a repair or construction service is being
performed on or to property in the area where parked.
E. Use Of Parking Spaces. Except as expressly permitted by this Chapter,
no off-street parking area shall be utilized for any other purpose.

Loading Spaces. [R.O. 1992 § 400.265; Ord. No. 16-11557,
8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017]
F. Use Of Loading Spaces. No loading space shall be utilized for any other
purpose nor be used to satisfy any of the required off-street parking
spaces.
G. Lighting. Lighting standards for parking lots, loading areas, access
drives, private drives and other public activity areas shall be in
compliance with the provisions of Article IV, Section 400.195(F).
A. General Provisions.
1. Section 400.265(C) and (D) of this Article contain the required
minimum number of parking and loading spaces for permitted
uses, special uses, and uses authorized under the planned
development procedure. In no case shall these standards be
waived, except as provided for in Section 400.265(B).
2. For proposed uses not listed in the table of Section 400.265(C), the
Table of Permitted and Special Uses of Article III, Section 400.120,
may be used to determine the requirements based on the similarity
of use. Uses in the same NAICS sector will, in many instances, have
similar requirements. As an example, offices for accountants
(NAICS Code 5411) will have similar requirements for those of
architects or attorneys (also NAICS Code 5411). However, offices
that have higher employment density (such as data processing or
clearinghouse operations) may have greater requirements. In such
instances, the provisions of Subsection (A)(3) below shall apply.
3. In situations where a use is proposed where the schedule of
parking and loading requirements does not adequately address
parking requirements for such use, then such use shall be
considered a special use, if not already a special use. The special
use permit for such use shall specify the required number of offstreet
parking spaces that satisfy the peak demand for parking
associated with such use. In making its determination, the Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider
information on the parking demand associated with the proposed
use as presented by the applicant and the Zoning Administrator.
4. Parking spaces for multiple-family subdivisions may be located and
vehicles authorized to park in residential districts may be parked in
the side or rear yards and in the front yard only where provisions
for such parking are an integral part of the plan as shown on a final
plat. Driveways and parking areas shall be an improved surface of
either asphalt or concrete.
5. Parking facilities may be jointly used by certain land uses as
follows:
Section
400.260
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.265
100:711
a. Up to fifty percent (50%) of the required parking spaces for
theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, dance halls,
nightclubs, or cafes; and up to one hundred percent (100%) of
the parking spaces required for a church or school auditorium,
may be provided and used jointly by banks, offices, retail
stores, repair shops, service establishments and similar uses
not normally open, used or operated during the same hours as
those listed in Subsection (A)(1) and (2) above.
b. However, any such joint use arrangement as outlined above
must be accompanied by a written agreement assuring the use
and retention of the allotted parking spaces for such purposes
that shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties
concerned and shall be filed with the application for a building
permit or occupancy permit.
B. Exceptions To The Minimum Off-Street Parking And Loading Space
Requirements.
1. Exception for the C-3 District:
a. Section 400.265(C) and (D) of this Article shall not apply to any
reoccupancy of existing buildings or structures, whether or not
the new use is similar to the previously permitted use, when
located within the following area of the C-3 Central
Commercial District.
b. This exception does not apply to expansion or change in use of
a building or site where such expansion or change in use would
result in a reduction in the number of existing off-street
parking spaces accessory to the building or site. In addition,
this exception does not apply to redevelopment of any site
located within the above-described area.
2. Parking Exception For Places Of Worship. On-site parking facilities
required for places of worship may be reduced by not more than
fifty percent (50%) where such facilities are located in a nonresidential
district and within five hundred (500) feet of public or
private parking lots having sufficient spaces to make up for the
reduction. The use of an off-site public parking lot may only be
authorized under the special use permit procedure (see Article V).
The use of an off-site private parking lot shall comply with Section
400.255(C)(2)(a) and be subject to the approval of the Zoning
Administrator.
3. Exception For Elderly Housing. The off-street parking requirements
for housing marketed and intended for occupancy by elderly
persons may be reduced to seventy-five hundredths (0.75) space
per dwelling unit, subject to the special use permit procedure (see
Article V) or the procedures associated with planned development
districts (see Article III, Section 400.115). Approval of such a
reduction shall be predicated on reserving an area on the site to
Section
400.265
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.265
100:712
accommodate the additional parking that would otherwise be
required should conversion to conventional housing occur in the
future.
4. Exception For Change Of Use Of Existing Commercial Buildings:
a. A reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces
for the reuse of a commercial building, existing prior to the
effective date of this Chapter, may be authorized under the
special use permit procedure (see Article V), subject to the
following conditions:
(1) The reduction shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%)
of the off-street parking space requirements for the
proposed use;
(2) No reduction shall be made in the amount of existing
available off-street parking spaces on site;
(3) The proposed use does not involve an expansion of the
building that would result in additional parking
requirements;
(4) Notwithstanding compliance with other standards
contained in this Article (e.g., setbacks and landscaping),
any portion of the site that can be reasonably converted to
off-street parking shall be so used to satisfy a portion of
the parking requirement; and
(5) The reduction shall not result in "spill-over" parking on
adjacent or nearby properties.
b. In making its determination, the Plan Commission and City
Council shall consider information on the parking demand
associated with the proposed use as presented by the applicant
and City staff.

provisions:
1. Ordinary Repair And Maintenance:
a. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement,
installation or relocation of non-bearing walls, non-bearing
partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on

be deemed to authorize any violation of Subsections (A)(2)
through (5) below and Section 400.300(B), (C), and (D) of this
Article.
b. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring of a structure to a safe condition in
accordance with an order of the Zoning Administrator, and
where such restoration will not be in compliance with Section

substantially alter the exterior appearance of a building by adding
or removing architectural elements.
3. Expansion Of Use. Except as provided for in Section 400.300(F), no
non-conforming use of a lot or building shall be enlarged, expanded
or extended to occupy a greater area of lot or building than was
occupied on the effective date of this Chapter, or amendment
thereto, and no additional accessory use, building or structure shall
be established thereon.
4. Enlargement Of Building Or Structure. Except as provided for in
Section 400.300(F), no building or structure that is devoted in
whole or in part to a non-conforming use shall be enlarged or added
to in any manner, unless such building or structure addition and the
entire use thereof (both existing space and the addition) shall
thereafter conform to all of the provisions of this Chapter.
5. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any other
location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure
and use thereof shall thereafter conform to all of the provisions of
this Chapter after being so moved. No non-conforming use of land
shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to
all of the provisions this Chapter after being so moved.
6. Compliance With Performance Standards. Any non-conforming use
shall be brought into conformance with the performance standards
established in Article IV, Section 400.195, of this Chapter upon the
effective date of this Chapter, or any applicable amendment
thereto.
B. Change Of Use. A non-conforming use shall not be changed to any use
other than a permitted use in the zoning district in which the property
is located. When a non-conforming use has been changed to any
permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming
use.
C. Discontinuance Of Use. No building or land used in whole or in part for
a non-conforming use which is discontinued and remains idle or unused
for a continuous period of two (2) years, whether or not the equipment
or fixtures are removed, shall again be used except in conformity with
the use regulations of the district in which such building is located.
D. Non-Conforming Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a
principal non-conforming use shall continue after such principal use
has been discontinued, as defined herein.

§ 400.305; Ord. No. 16-11557, 8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017]
Any existing dimensional non-conformity may be continued, so long as
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. Existing uses which were issued a special use permit and continue
to be classified as special uses under the applicable district
regulations of this Chapter, or amendment thereto, shall not be
considered a non-conforming use. Such a use may continue, subject
to compliance with the conditions set forth in the special use
permit. The same applies to uses approved with conditions of use
attached under the site plan review procedure, which under this
Chapter are classified as a special use.
2. Existing uses which were issued a special use permit or site plan
review approval prior to the effective date of this Chapter or
amendment thereto, but are no longer permitted as a special use or
as a permitted use upon such effective date, shall be considered a
non-conforming use, subject to the provisions of this Article.
3. Uses existing prior to the effective date of this Chapter, or
amendment thereto, which were not classified as a special use, but
are so classified upon such effective date, shall be deemed a lawful
conforming use. In the event that such existing use is to be altered
(other than maintenance and remodeling), expanded, intensified,
or otherwise changed, then such use shall be required to obtain a
special use permit, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article V
of this Chapter.
F. Exceptions. Any structure devoted to a non-conforming dwelling use
(e.g., a dwelling located in a non-dwelling district where such uses are
not permitted) may be remodeled, extended, expanded and enlarged;
provided that, after any such remodeling, extension, expansion, or
enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a
greater number of dwelling units than such structure accommodated
prior to any such work, and provided that such work does not create
any dimensional non-conformities, except as may be authorized under
Section 400.305 below. This Subsection shall not be deemed to
authorize any violation of Section 400.300(A)(5) and (6) or Section
400.300(B), (C), (D), or (E).
A. Non-Conforming Lots Of Record. Lots of record, established prior to the
effective date of this Chapter, or amendments thereto, that have any
dimensional non-conformities may be used for purposes allowable by
this Chapter, subject to the requirements and limitations established
under Article IV, Section 400.145, of this Chapter and the further
requirements and limitations established as follows:
1. Such lot, when located in any non-dwelling district, shall not be less
than five thousand (5,000) square feet nor less than forty (40) feet
Section
400.300
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.305
100:728
in width; shall only be used for open space or an office building;
and any buildings placed thereon shall meet the required setbacks
of the applicable district regulations, subject to setback exceptions
established under Article IV, Section 400.145, of this Chapter.
2. In any event, a non-conforming lot of record shall not be used for
the development of a freestanding principal structure, unless:
a. Such lot was owned separately and individually from adjoining
tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size
and width at such location would not have been prohibited by
the zoning ordinance adopted by the City; and
b. Has remained in separate and individual ownership from
adjoining tracts of land continually during the entire time that
creation of such lot has been prohibited by the applicable
zoning ordinance.
3. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the combination of a nonconforming
lot of record, or portions thereof, with another
adjoining lot, or lots, so as to create zoning lots which comply with
the requirements of this Chapter. Such consolidations may be
accomplished under the subdivision procedures specified in
Chapter 410 of the Washington Municipal Code or treated as a
zoning lot as defined in Article II of this Chapter.
B. Non-Conforming Structures.
1. Non-Conforming Structures Associated With Conforming Uses. Any
non-conforming structure which is associated with a conforming
use may remain as a non-conforming structure, subject to the
following provisions:
a. Enlargement, Repair, Alterations. Any such structure may be
enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled; provided,
however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or
remodeling shall either create any additional non-conformity
or increase the degree of existing non-conformity of all or any
part of such structure, except as may be permitted under
Section 400.305(C) of this Article.
b. Damage Or Substandard Conditions. Any such structure shall
be subject to the provisions of Section 400.310 of this Article.
c. Moving. No such structure shall be moved, in whole or in part,
to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the
entire structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of
this Chapter after being moved.
2. Dimensional Non-Conformity Associated With Non-Conforming
Uses. Any dimensional non-conformity associated with a nonconforming
use may remain non-conforming, subject to the
Section

GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
400.305
100:729
Section 400.310. Damage Or Substandard Conditions. [R.O. 1992

regulations contained in Sections 400.300 and 400.310 of this
Article.
C. Exceptions To Non-Conforming Dwellings. A one-family or two-family
dwelling which lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this
Chapter, or amendment thereto, and which fails to comply with the
dimensional requirements of this Chapter may be expanded and such
expansion may encroach upon required building setbacks; provided,
however, that such addition shall only be permitted to extend to the
horizontal or vertical plane of the building's exterior wall or the
building's height which is in non-conformance with a required setback
or building height limitation. In other words, the addition shall not
create a dimensional non-conformity that is greater than the existing
dimensional non-conformity.
D. Other Dimensional Non-Conformities. Any other dimensional nonconformities
may remain non-conforming, so long as any modification
to a building site or the structures thereon, as may be permitted by this
Article, does not create any increase in the degree of such other
dimensional non-conformity and no reduction in required off-street
parking shall be permitted, except as may be provided for under Article
VI of this Chapter.
A. Restoration. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 405 as applies to
signs, nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit the restoration
of any structure and its use where such structure has been damaged, by
any means, to an extent less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement
value (excluding the value of the land, the cost of preparation of land,
and the value of any foundation associated with such structure) at the
time of damage, as determined by the Zoning Administrator; provided,
however, that the restoration of such structure and its use in no way
increases any former non-conformity, and provided that restoration of
such structure is begun within six (6) months of such damage and
diligently prosecuted to completion within one (1) year following such
damage.
B. Damage. When a building, the use of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Chapter, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or
the public enemy, to the extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%)
of its value, it shall not be restored except in conformity with the
district regulations of the district in which the building is situated.
When a building, the use of which does not conform to the provisions of
this Chapter, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or the public
enemy, to the extent of less than seventy-five percent (75%) of its value,
it may be restored if the Board of Adjustment finds some compelling
public necessity requiring the continuance of the non-conforming use.

relationships between doors and windows should be compatible
with the architectural style and character of the landmark and with
surrounding structures within a historic district.
3. Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces. The relationship of a
structure within a historic district to the open space between it and
adjoining structures should be compatible.
4. Roof Shape. The design of the roof should be compatible with the
architectural style and character of the landmarks and surrounding
structures in a historic district.
5. Landscaping. Landscaping should be compatible with the
architectural character and appearance of the landmark and of
surrounding structures and landscapes in historic districts.

structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.

of their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
4. Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building. These
changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this
significance shall be recognized and respected.
5. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
6. Distinctive architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be
based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.

1. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment on any matter over which the
Board is herein specifically granted jurisdiction may be taken by
any person aggrieved, by any neighborhood organization as defined
in Section 32.105, RSMo., representing such person, or by an
officer, department or board, other than the Board of Adjustment,
or Bureau of the City affected by any decision of the Zoning
Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time,
as shall be prescribed by the Board of Adjustment by general rule,
by filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a notice
of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator
shall immediately transmit to the Board all the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from is taken.
2. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a fee of sixty dollars
($60.00) as and for the fee for the appeal. No appeal shall be
allowed unless the appeal fee has been paid to the City.
B. Stays Of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to
the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him/her
that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application or notice to the Zoning Administrator on due cause shown.
C. Hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
appeal, give not less than fifteen (15) days' notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation, as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the
hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
A. Powers. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
1. Powers Relative To Errors. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this Chapter.
2. Powers Relating To Variations. Where, by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at
the time of the original adoption of the regulations, or by reason of
exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of property,
which conditions are not generally prevalent in the neighborhood,
the strict application of the area regulations of this Chapter would
result in peculiar and exceptional difficulties to, or exceptional and
undue hardship upon, the owner of such property, the Board is
Section
400.540
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
400.545
100:770
hereby empowered to authorize, upon an appeal relating to such
property, a variation from such strict application so as to relieve
such difficulties or hardships.
3. Powers Relative To Exceptions. Upon appeal, the Board is hereby
empowered to permit the following exceptions:
a. To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of
a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record.
b. To permit the reconstruction of a non-conforming building
which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or by
the public enemy to the extent of less than seventy-five percent
(75%) of its value where the Board shall find some compelling
public necessity requiring a continuance of the non-conforming
use.
c. To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of
premises in any location for a public service corporation for
public utility purposes which the Board deems reasonably
necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
d. To add to the permitted uses in the C Commercial and M
Industrial Districts when the Board has determined that a use
is comparable to those already permitted in such district.
e. To interpret the provisions of this Chapter where the street
layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as
shown on the map fixing the several districts, which map is on
file in the office of the City Clerk.
f. To vary the parking regulations of this Chapter whenever the
character or use of the building is such as to make unnecessary
the full provision of parking facilities or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the
use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an advantage
or a convenience.
g. To vary such other regulations as shall appear in the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Washington, Missouri, where such
variance is necessary to prevent exceptional and undue
hardship upon the owner of such property, to the extent
authorized by Missouri law.
4. Board May Affirm, Modify, Or Reverse Decision. In exercising the
above-mentioned powers, such Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all
the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. In
considering all appeals to this Chapter, the Board shall, before

making any finding in a specific case, first determine that the
proposed change will not constitute a change in the District Map
and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, or increase the congestion in public streets, or increase
the danger of fire or materially diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area, or in any other
respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and
welfare of the City of Washington. Every change granted or denied
by the Board shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact
based on sworn testimony and evidence specifying the reason for
granting or denying the variation.
5. Vote Of Four (4) Members Of Board Required To Reverse. The
concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under
this Chapter, or to effect any variation in this Chapter.
A. Petition To The County Circuit Court. Any person jointly or severally
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment or of any officer,
department, board or bureau of the City may present to the circuit
court having jurisdiction in the County a petition, duly verified, stating
that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the grounds
of the illegality and asking for relief therefrom. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the Board.
B. Court Proceeding. Upon the presentation of such petition, the court
may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board for review of the
data and records acted upon, or it may appoint a referee to take
additional evidence in the case. The court may reverse or affirm or may
modify the decision brought up for review.

Design And Location Requirements
Section 405.025. Computation Of Area And Height. [R.O. 1992
§ 405.025; Ord. No. 16-11557, 8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017]
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height.
A. Computation Of Area Of Individual Signs. The area of a sign face [which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other with only one (1) face] shall
be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits
of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework,
bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such face or wall otherwise
meets Zoning Code regulations and is clearly incidental to the display
itself.
B. Computation Of Area Of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with
more than one (1) face shall be computed by adding together the area
of all sign faces visible from any one (1) point. When two (2) identical
sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed
from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of
the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches
apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of
the faces.
C. Computation Of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the lower of:
1. Existing grade prior to construction; or
2. The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of
locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot
reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the
sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a
public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to
the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
D. Computation Of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area For A Lot. The
permitted sum of all individual signs on a lot shall be computed by
applying the formula contained in Table B, Maximum Total Sign Area,135
135. Editor's Note: See Section 405.035 for Table B.

to the lot frontage, or principal building face area, as appropriate,
for the zoning district in which the lot is located. Lots fronting on
two (2) or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each
street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a
particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area
allocation that is derived from the lot frontage or building face on that
street.
A. Permitted Signs. Signs shall be allowed on private property in the City
in accordance with and only in accordance with Table A in Section
405.035 below. If the letter "A" appears for a sign type in a column, such
sign is allowed without prior permit approval in the zoning districts
represented by that column. If the letter "P" appears for a sign type in a
column, such sign is allowed only with prior permit approval in the
zoning districts represented by that column. Special conditions may
apply in some cases. If the letter "N" appears for a sign type in a
column, such a sign is not allowed in the zoning districts represented by
that column under any circumstances.
B. Permitted Signs Subject To Qualifications. Although permitted under
the previous Subsection, a sign designated by a "P" or "A" in Table A in
Section 405.035 shall only be allowed if the sum of the areas of all
building and freestanding signs on the lot conforms to the maximum
permitted sign area as determined by the formula for the zoning district
and/or highway/street in which the lot is located as specified in Tables
B, C-1 and C-2.
A. Permitted Types And Standards. All signs shall be designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with the permitted types and
standards as set forth in Tables A, B, C-1 and C-2 in this Section and all
signs shall comply with applicable provisions of Title V, the Building
Code of the City of Washington.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the division of land
within the City of Washington in order to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare. The platting of land is the first step in the
process of urban development. The arrangement of land parcels in the
community for residential, commercial and industrial uses and for
streets, alleys, schools, parks, drainageways and utility easements will
determine to a large degree the design, character and conditions in the
urban area. The quality of the urban areas is of public interest. These
regulations and standards for the platting of a subdividing of land for
urban use are to make provision for adequate light, air, open space,
drainage, traffic circulation, utilities and other needs to ensure the
development and maintenance of a healthy, attractive and efficient
community.
B. Intent. These regulations are designed specifically and intended to:
1. Protect, provide for and promote the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity, and general welfare of
the residents of the City of Washington.
2. Guide the future growth and development of the City in accordance
with the Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and approved by the City Council.
3. Provide for adequate light, air, and privacy; to secure safety from
fire, flood and other danger; and to prevent the overcrowding of the
land and undue conflict or congestion of people, traffic, or other
human activities.
4. Protect and conserve the value of buildings and improvements, and
to minimize the adverse impact of development on adjoining or
nearby properties.
5. Establish a beneficial relationship between the uses of land and
buildings, and the municipal street system; to require the proper
location and design of streets and building lines; to minimize traffic
congestion, and to make adequate provision for pedestrian traffic
circulation.
6. Establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for
subdivision and resubdivision in order to further the orderly layout
and use of land; and to ensure proper legal descriptions and
136. Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed the prior Subdivision Regulations, adopted

documentation of subdivided land for the protection of both buyers
and sellers of land.
7. Encourage the wise use and management of natural resources; to
provide adequate and safe recreational areas; to maintain the
natural beauty and topography of the City, and to ensure
appropriate development with regard to these natural features; to
minimize the pollution of air, ponds and streams; to ensure the
adequacy of stormwater drainage and detention as well as erosion
control facilities.
8. Encourage and require the design and development of residential
and commercial land and subdivisions of land that provide
necessary public facilities and improvements, including streets,
facilities for storm drainage, water, sewerage, school sites and park
areas in accordance with City standards.
A. Minimum Requirements And Interpretation Of Provisions.
1. The provisions of this Chapter shall be considered the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and
welfare. Where provisions of this Chapter impose greater
restrictions than those of any statute, other ordinance or
regulation, the provisions of this Chapter shall be controlling.
Where the provisions of any statute, other ordinance or regulation
impose greater restrictions than this Chapter, the provisions of
such statute, other ordinance or regulation shall be controlling.
2. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Chapter, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity
and general welfare. It is not intended by this Chapter to interfere
with or abrogate or annul any ordinance, rules, regulations or
permits previously adopted or issued, and not in conflict with any of
the provisions of this Chapter or this Title, or which shall be
adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the development of
property, the use of buildings or premises, and likewise not in
conflict with this Chapter or this Title; nor is it intended by this
Chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements,
covenants or other agreements between parties; except, that if this
Chapter imposes a greater restriction, this Chapter shall control.
3. Whenever any provision of this Chapter refers to or cites a section
of the relevant State law or rules and regulations and that section is
later amended or superseded, this Chapter shall be deemed
amended to refer to the amended section or the section that most
nearly corresponds to the superseded section.

B. Outline Of Procedures.
1. It is recommended that each applicant first confer with the City
Engineer, or authorized representative, to become familiar with the
applicable rules and regulations through a pre-design conference
before submitting a preliminary subdivision plat. The subdivider
should thus become thoroughly informed of the subdivision, zoning
and setback requirements and of the Comprehensive Plan for the
City or for any portion of the City affecting the territory in which
the proposed subdivision is to be located.
Section
410.030
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
410.035
100:825
2. Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, before any contract
is made for the sale of any part of the subdivision, and before any
permit for the development of or construction of any improvement
on any land in such proposed subdivision shall be granted, the
applicant shall apply for and secure approval of such proposed
subdivision in accordance with the following procedures, which
include the following:
a. Pre-design conference.
b. Sketch plat review (optional).
c. Technical design conference (optional).
d. Preliminary subdivision plat and subdivision construction
plans.
e. Final plat.
3. Prior to or at the time of submission of the Preliminary Subdivision
Plat, the applicant shall pay a processing fee determined as follows:
a. Subdivisions containing two (2) lots or fewer: seventy-five
dollars ($75.00).
b. Subdivisions containing more than two (2) lots: seventy-five
dollars ($75.00) plus seven dollars ($7.00) per lot in excess of
two (2) lots.
C. Pre-Design Conference. A developer contemplating the development of
a new subdivision should request a preapplication review conference
with the City subdivision review team. The objective of this procedure is
to provide for an informal review of a proposed subdivision with the
developer and appropriate City staff. This informal review will give the
developer an opportunity to become familiar with the applicable
subdivision regulations and to discuss the subdivision requirements
before incurring substantial expense in making detailed plans. The
developer should prepare and bring to the conference a rough sketch of
the proposed subdivision.
D. Sketch Plan Review. Prior to submitting a preliminary plat for the
subdivision of land it is recommended that the subdivider or developer
submit to the Planning and Zoning Commission a sketch plan for the
tract to give the Commission an opportunity to review the project, make
any necessary suggestions, and approve the concept of the
development prior to the developer submitting the preliminary plat.
The sketch plat allows for an initial review of planning and can
accommodate appropriate changes in lot configuration and density at
minimum design costs. The sketch plat shall include the following
information, all of which may be based on sources of information other
than field survey data:
1. The location of the tract in relation to the surrounding area;
Section
410.035
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
410.035
100:826
2. The approximate location of all existing structures within the tract
proposed to be retained and wooded areas within the tract and
within two hundred (200) feet thereof;
3. The names of the owners of all property adjoining the tract as
disclosed by the most recent Assessor's record;
4. All existing streets, roads, and approximate location of wet and dry
weather watercourses, floodplain areas, sink holes, and other
significant physical features within the tract and within two
hundred (200) feet thereof;
5. Proposed preliminary construction plans;
6. Approximate location of proposed streets and property lines;
7. A rough sketch of the proposed site plan;
8. North arrow and scale; and
9. Direction of and approximate distance to nearest existing major
street intersection.
E. Technical Design Conference. After the Planning and Zoning reviews
and comments on the sketch plan, a technical design conference is
recommended. The voluntary technical design conference provides an
opportunity for the applicant to voluntarily review with the City
Engineer, the City Planner and other appropriate City personnel, the
City's design and construction standards as they affect the applicant's
development objectives. This procedure will enable the applicant to
receive the benefit of input from City personnel prior to the design of
the subdivision construction plans and the preliminary plat.
F. Preliminary Subdivision Plat. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by
a licensed land surveyor. The survey work for a preliminary subdivision
plat should provide sufficient information regarding a proposed
subdivision of land to allow the Commission to evaluate the site
development concept as it relates to the City's goals and objectives in
general and for the area being subdivided in particular, and to decide
on the merits of the proposed subdivision. Plans shall be drawn at a
horizontal scale of not more than one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet, and
a vertical scale of one (1) inch equals ten (10) feet, and map sheets shall
be no greater than twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches. The
following information should be included on the preliminary plat:

sign one (1) copy of the preliminary plat and return the same to the
developer or subdivider not later than seven (7) days after approval
is given.
5. Effect Of Approval. Upon receipt of the signed copy of the
preliminary plat and approved construction plans, the developer or
subdivider shall be authorized to begin construction of the
minimum improvements as required herein on the entire
subdivision or the section or plat of the subdivision so approved. All
minimum improvements shall be installed and approved before the
final plat is submitted to the City unless written approval is given
by the City Council to complete said improvements as the
subdivision is developed.
a. In lieu of the completion of the minimum improvements
previous to the final approval of a plat, the City Council shall
accept, at the option of the developer, an escrow secured with
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited with the City.
The City may accept a surety bond and such bond shall be in an

release of the escrow, letter of credit or bond, the City shall
accept a replacement escrow or letter of credit from the
successor developer in the form allowed in Subsection
(G)(5)(a) and in the amount of the escrow or letter of credit
held by the City at the time of the property transfer and, upon
receipt of the replacement escrow or letter of credit, the City
shall release the original escrow or letter of credit in full and
release the prior developer from all further obligations with
respect to the minimum improvements if the successor
developer assumes all of the outstanding obligations of the
previous developer. The City may accept a surety bond from

full and release the prior developer from all further obligations
with respect to the minimum improvements.
c. Any escrow or bond amount held by the City to secure actual
construction and installation on each component of the
improvements or utilities shall, upon request, be released
within thirty (30) days of completion of each category of
improvement or utility work to be installed, minus a maximum
retention of five percent (5%) which shall be released upon
completion of all improvements and utility work. The City shall
inspect each category of improvement or utility work within
twenty (20) business days after a request for such inspection.

bond amount are duly posted with the United States Postal
Service or other agreed-upon delivery service or when the
escrow funds or bond amount are hand delivered to an
authorized person or place as specified by the owner or
developer.
d. If the City has not released the escrow funds or bond amount
within thirty (30) days as provided in this Section or provided a
timely inspection of the improvements or utility work after
request for such inspection, the City shall pay the owner or
developer in addition to the escrow funds due the owner or
developer, interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1 1/
2%) per month calculated from the expiration of the thirty-day
period until the escrow funds or bond amount have been
released. Any owner or developer aggrieved by the City's
failure to observe the requirements of this Section may bring a
civil action to enforce the provisions of this Section. In any civil
action or part of a civil action brought pursuant to this Section,
the Court may award the prevailing party or the City the
amount of all costs attributable to the action, including
reasonable attorneys' fees.

Management Standards.
A. Compliance. No subdivision plat shall be approved unless it conforms to
the following minimum standards of design.
B. Streets.
1. Relation To Adjoining Streets. Except for existing dead-end streets
or situations where topography or other factors make it
impractical, relationships to adjoining streets shall be as follows:
a. Proposed streets generally shall connect with streets already
established, or provide for future connections to adjoining
unsubdivided tracts, or shall be reasonable projections of
streets in the nearest subdivision tracts.
b. Stub streets shall be constructed to the property lines when
required to provide for future connections to adjoining
undeveloped tracts. Reasonable projections of streets in
nearby subdivisions or water, storm, or sanitary sewer line
easements shall establish the location of stub streets.
c. All stub streets in excess of four hundred fifty (450) feet in
length measured from the center line of the street intersection
to the property line or plat boundary shall be provided with a
temporary turnaround. Permits will not be issued for building
construction on lots abutting a temporary turnaround as shown
on any recorded subdivision plat unless and until the
temporary facility is actually constructed and has been
approved by the City Engineer. In general, the temporary
turnaround shall meet the design requirements of a cul-de-sac
turning circle as specified in Section 410.050(B)(5) below. The
paved area beyond the required paved width of the roadway
may be of a type that can be more easily removed once the
street is extended or connected to an adjoining street. The
pavement type and material for the temporary paved areas
shall be as permitted by the City Engineer.
d. The arrangement of rights-of-way in a subdivision shall provide
for the continuation of existing streets or rights-of-way in
Section
410.045
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
410.050
100:837
adjoining areas, unless the Commission deems such
continuation undesirable for reasons of topography or design.
e. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major street, the City Engineer may require frontage or service
streets, double frontage lots with screen planting, and nonaccess
strips at the rear of such lots.
f. In situations where development is proposed on a lot or lots
with driveways intersecting City collector or major streets, onsite
turnaround capability is required in order to eliminate
having to back out onto streets.
g. A subdivision entrance street shall intersect the major or
collector street with an interior angle between seventy degrees
(70°) and ninety degrees (90°) and be positioned to provide
adequate sight distance along each intersecting roadway as
determined by the City Engineer.
h. Wherever possible subject to review by the City Engineer, a
street or driveway intersection with any street shall be located
so as to provide adequate sight distance with respect to
topographic conditions (i.e., the crest of a hill) in order to avoid
situations where the location of the intersection may impede
the ability to see oncoming traffic.
2. Extension Of Streets. Where, in the opinion of the Commission, it is
desirable to provide future street access to adjoining areas, the
streets and rights-of-way in the subdivision shall be extended by
the provision of a right-of-way for street purposes from the end of
pavement to the property line of the subdivision. The street
arrangements shall not be such as to cause undue hardship to
owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and
providing convenient access to it. However, nothing herein shall be
construed to require that private streets in one (1) subdivision shall
provide access to adjacent land.
3. Widths of Rights-Of-Way.
a. Streets shall have the following rights-of-way:
(1) Major as indicated by the Comprehensive Plan, not less
than sixty (60) feet.

Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows
one (1) or more lots containing more than one (1) acre of land and there
are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into
smaller building sites, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets
and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a
requirement of the plat.
A. General. Where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that
extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict
compliance with these regulations, it may approve variations or
exceptions to these subdivision regulations so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such
variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent
and purpose of these regulations; and further provided that the City
Council shall not recommend variations unless it shall make findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
1. The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is
located.
Section
410.055
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
410.065
100:843
2. The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property.
3. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations
are carried out.
4. The variation will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
zoning order, Master Plan or major highway plan.
B. Exceptions For Commercial And Industrial Developments. In instances
where larger commercial or industrial developments are created as
part of a planned development created under the provisions of Chapter
400, Section 400.115, of the Zoning Code, or where existing
developments were created under prior code provisions of a similar
nature, property may be further subdivided without frontage on a
public or private street subject to the following conditions:
1. The overall development (shopping center or industrial park, for
example) comprising the subject property shall have been
subdivided in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter.
2. The original subdivision for the development shall have access to
public or private streets which comply with the requirements of
this Chapter.
3. Any resulting lot proposed for subdivision not having access to a
public or private street shall have appropriate evidence in the form
of a plat and access easements or rights-of-way grants upon the
adjoining lot or lots that provides access in perpetuity to the lot
proposed for subdivision.
4. These provisions are not intended to promote the creation of flag
lots for properties or developments that are not part of larger
planned development that are comprised of multiple commercial or
industrial users.
C. Conditions. In recommending variations and exceptions, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may require such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or
requirements of these regulations.
D. Private Streets. Private streets can be requested only as part of a
planned development. Justification demonstrating unique or peculiar
characteristics associated with a proposed development must be shown
as to why a public street is not appropriate. All private streets must be
approved by City Council as part of a final development plan approval.
Private street signs must be purchased by the developer and be a color
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Private streets existing prior to

Statutory Authorization; Findings Of Fact; Purposes
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization. [R.O. 1992 § 415.010;
Ord. No. 16-11557, 8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017138]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 77.260, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Washington, Missouri
ordains as follows.
Section 415.015. Findings Of Fact. [R.O. 1992 § 415.015; Ord. No.
16-11557, 8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017]
A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of the City of Washington, Missouri (hereinafter referred
to as "the City") are subject to inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
1. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
2. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods,
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the
depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any
one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's
FIS, and illustrative materials for Franklin County, Missouri, dated
138. Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed the prior Flood Damage Prevention
Regulations, adopted 9-19-2011 by Ord. No. 11-10882 and included in the Code as Ch.
495.

September 14, 2018, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
[Ord. No. 18-11890, 8-6-2018]
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of flood-fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in
Article I, Section 415.015(A); to establish or maintain the City's
eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements
of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, to be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

such enclosure elevated to the base flood elevation. Such enclosed
areas shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet
or exceed the following minimum criteria:
a. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
c. Flood-resistant materials only shall be utilized to the base flood
elevation plus two (2) feet. All utilities shall be placed above
the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet. These utilities shall
include sanitary sewer facilities, water facilities and all

permitted in an enclosed lower area shall be limited to that
which is incidental and accessory to the principal use of the
structure.
B. Standards For Lowest Floor Elevations. It shall be unlawful to construct
any structure susceptible to flood damage due to backflow through the
sanitary sewer system, unless the lowest floor, including basement, is
elevated two (2) feet or more above the elevation of the base flood.
A. Installation Requirements. All manufactured homes to be placed within
all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the City's
FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
In the event that over-the-top frame ties to ground anchors are used,
the following specific requirements (or their equivalent) shall be met:
1. Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four (4) corners of
the manufactured home with two (2) additional ties per side at the

16-11557, 8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017139]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide minimum standards,
controls and criteria for stormwater management. The principal design
consideration in this Chapter is to minimize the harmful physical and
economic effects of erosion, sedimentation and flooding from
stormwater runoff. This is to be accomplished through the requirement
of special measures to mitigate erosion, both during and after
construction, the detention and controlled discharge of the differential
runoff from the development and a well-designed stormwater
conveyance system.
B. Intent. The intent of this Chapter is to ensure that the drainage of
surface waters will not be changed by new construction, or that if
surface water drainage is to be changed, reasonable provision has been
made for collection and diversion of such surface waters into public
areas or drains which the property owner or developer has a right to
use, and that such surface waters will be planned for so as to reduce the
likelihood of damage to adjacent properties.

quality, of surface water draining onto other properties;
2. Will damage other properties;
3. Does not conform to the general drainage laws of the State, the
ordinances of the City, and, in particular, the rules, regulations, and
standards of this Chapter; and
4. Alters or removes wetlands from their present location without
City, State, Federal permits as may be required.
A. Sediment And Erosion Control Standards.
1. General. Sediment and erosion control will be accomplished by
applying conservation practices that will reduce the potential for
damage from these hazards. Control practices use trapping,
filtering or diversion techniques to protect adjacent properties
from land disturbance activities.
Section
420.020
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
420.035
100:883
2. NPDES Stormwater Permits. Construction sites, where the area to
be disturbed is one (1) acre or more, must apply for a stormwater
discharge permit from the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources. If required, the applicant must obtain and submit proof
of an NPDES stormwater permit to the City, before plans will be
approved. Permit requirements are set forth in 10 CSR20-6.200 of
the Missouri clean water laws.
3. When Controls Are Required. Sediment and erosion control shall be
implemented whenever necessary, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, to prevent damage to off-site property, drainage facilities
or watercourses. Generally, standard vegetative and structural
practices, as specified below, that filter, divert or promote the
settlement of sediment particles from storm runoff shall be
provided in the following situations:
a. To prevent sediment-laden runoff from leaving disturbed areas.
b. To isolate disturbed areas from erosive surface runoff
associated with significant undisturbed areas.
c. To protect storm drainage conveyance systems at operable
inlets.
4. Types Of Controls.
a. The stormwater management plan shall be selected, installed,
operated and maintained to adequately control erosion,
capture sediment and prevent pollution. To achieve these goals
BMPs in accordance with the concepts and methods described
in either of the following two (2) documents should be utilized.

above publications. Engineering professionals are encouraged
to design innovative ways to address site specific conditions.
5. Filter Strip. Clearing and grubbing within twenty-five (25) feet of
the top of an existing stream bank should be avoided. If the twentyfive-
foot filter strip is disturbed, site specific erosion controls that
protect the stream bank shall be implemented.
6. Construction Plans.
a. The applicant shall submit a sediment and erosion control plan
which must be approved by the City Council prior to
preliminary plat approval. The plan shall include a contoured
development map clearly indicating the pattern of surface
Section

WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
420.035
100:884
water runoff, both upstream and downstream of the
development, the existing and proposed grading contours and
the planned sedimentation and erosion control facilities. The
phasing of construction activities shall be presented. Such
phasing shall identify the sequence of construction activities
and the related BMPs to include clearing, installing BMP, rough
grading, installing utilities, paving streets, final grading and
vegetative cover.
b. The City Council shall have authority to require proper
controls as specified herein. The City Engineer may require a
revised plan to be submitted for approval at any time due to
changing site conditions.
B. Design Criteria.
1. Purpose. A development's stormwater drainage system shall be
designed to:
a. Protect natural waterways.
b. Convey upstream and on-site stormwater runoff to a natural
watercourse or to a storm drainage facility.
c. Provide protection from the design storm event and address
the major storm so as to prevent major property damage and
loss of life.
2. Rainfall Frequency. All facilities shall be designed to carry a tenyear
storm of a duration which produces the maximum peak flow
rate of stormwater runoff. The stormwater conveyance system shall
be designed to allow for a 100-year storm to pass through the
subdivision without destroying or damaging property or inundating
dwellings. Design information which substantiates both conditions
shall be provided. See Figure A for rainfall curves for the two-, five-,
ten-, fifteen-, twenty- and 100-year frequencies.140
3. Calculation Of Runoff.
a. The method of calculating and routing stormwater runoff shall
be as stated herein. The drainage area shall consider all onand
off-site lands contributing to the proposed development's
drainage system. Capacity for such facilities shall be based on
the maximum potential water shed development permitted by
the Zoning Ordinance.141
b. Either the Rational Method or the TR-55 Method for
calculating stormwater runoff may be used for watersheds up
to ten (10) acres.
140. Editor's Note: Figure A is included as an attachment to this Chapter.

c. Figures A (rainfall intensity - referenced above) and B (runoff
factors) shall be utilized with the Rational Method.142
d. For watersheds larger than ten (10) acres, the SCS TR-55
Method shall be utilized. Other methods to determine peak
runoff must be approved by the City Engineer prior to
acceptance.
e. The minimum percentage of imperviousness to be used in
design shall be based on the zoning district as shown in the
following table:

R-2 Two-Family 60%
R-3 Multiple Family 70%
C-1 Limited Commercial 85%
C-2 General Commercial 85%
C-3 Central Commercial 90%
M-1 Industrial 90%
M-2 Industrial 90%
PD Planned Development
Districts
TBD based on plan type
Parking, streets, roofs 100%
f. The minimum percentage of imperviousness for Planned
Development Districts shall be dictated by the development
plan proposed for the specific district.
g. Special uses, such as schools, churches, etc., shall have the
differential runoff computed and approved by the City
Engineer.
h. Special circumstances may dictate that the developed
impervious area may differ from that shown in the above table.
An example may be single-family lots of larger than ten
thousand (10,000) square feet. Calculations prepared by a
registered professional engineer may be submitted to the City
142. Editor's Note: Figures A and B are included as attachments to this Chapter.

Engineer for his/her evaluation to determine if a minimum
impervious area which differs from that shown in the above
table may be utilized. Likewise, the City Engineer may
determine that the percent of impervious area for a particular
development differs from that shown in the above table.
i. See Figure B143 for the runoff factor to be utilized for various
impervious conditions and rainfall durations.
4. Open Channels.
a. Open channels consist of swales, ditches or depressions, both
natural and man-made, that convey water. Channels shall be
protected from scour and erosion by providing a channel lining
adequate to sustain the velocity of the ten-year design storm. If
velocities in channels exceed five (5) feet per second during
ten-year design storms, then erosion control other than
vegetation shall be provided in channel construction. Total
accumulation contained by man-made berms/swales shall be a
maximum of four (4) cubic feet per second.
b. Manning's Equation shall be used for calculating the hydraulic
capacity of open channels.
c. Acceptable improvements to channels include fabrics, gabion
lining, concrete channels, concrete slope paving, cribbing, bin
walls, etc. The roughness coefficient for each material shall be
per manufacturer or as indicated below:
n= Amount Channel/Pipe Type
0.012 For cast-in-place concrete, box culverts and
reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) over 48
inches in diameter
0.013 For concrete pipe less than 48 inches in
diameter
0.015 For vitrified clay pipe
0.020 For grouted rip rap
0.024 For corrugated metal pipe
0.033 For gabion walled channels
d. Channels shall have the hydraulic capacity to carry the tenyear
design storm runoff within the channel bed and banks.
Out-of-bank flow may be permitted on land slopes parallel to
the channel where it can be shown that no erosion damage or
serious property damage will result. Channels function as part
of the major drainage system and shall be evaluated for the
100-year design storm to determine the impacts of runoff on
143. Editor's Note: Figure B is included as an attachment to this Chapter.
Section
420.035
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section

100:887
adjacent property. The channel's hydraulic capacity shall be
increased where adjustments to channel geometry provide
significant protection to adjacent properties during the
100-year event.
5. Closed Conduit Storm Sewers.
a. Pipe sizes for closed conduit flow shall be based on the tenyear
design storm runoff and minimum allowable velocities.
The system shall provide for the cleaning of sediment and
other deposits by maintaining a minimum velocity of three (3)
fps during the ten-year storm.
b. Manning's Equation, the most common method of estimating
the capacity and flow resistance in closed conduits, shall be
utilized.
c. Closed conduit storm sewer systems shall convey the ten-year
design storm to a point of discharge by gravity or pressure
flow. In surcharge conditions, the hydraulic grade line shall be
calculated to reflect losses in pipes and structures and shall
not rise to an elevation greater than the three (3) feet above
the top of the sewer or two (2) feet below the inlet sill,
whichever is lower.
d. Generally, gravity flow occurs where the capacity of pipe run
exceeds the design flow and the outfall point does not control
discharge. Storm sewer systems may be designed for pressure
flow when the hydraulic grade line is above the crown of the
pipe. The decision to design a pressure flow system may be
based on aesthetics, the need to submerge outfalls, economics,
limitations associated with reduced pipe sizes or grade
constraints in outfalling the system.
6. Inlets. Calculations shall be submitted to demonstrate the capacity
of all inlets. Such calculations must consider the cross-slope of the
pavement, depth of water at the curb face, size of opening and the
longitudinal grade of street. Street inlets and inlets in parking
areas shall reduce the spread and depth of flow to acceptable levels
during the ten-year design storm. The acceptable level of flow for a
minor access or local access street would maintain an eight-foot
travel lane with a maximum one-inch depth. One clear ten-foot
travel lane must be maintained for a collector street, and two (2)
clear ten-foot travel lanes must be maintained for a major street.
Any area inundated by water ponding at an inlet during the tenyear
storm event shall be located within an easement or right-ofway.
The effects of the 100-year storm event shall also be analyzed
to ensure no property damage or dangerous conditions result.
Inlets located on continuous grades may be designed to permit a
portion of flow to bypass the structure; however, calculations for
the downstream structure must consider the bypass.

7. Plans And Calculations.
a. A drainage map shall be developed from a base reproduction of
the site plan or grading plan. The existing and proposed
contours shall be shown, normally at two-foot intervals, for the
subject property, extending off-site one hundred (100) feet or
less as determined by the Department for proper design of the
proposed improvements. Contour intervals other than the
above shall be used as determined by the site topography. Only
United State Geological Survey datum shall be used. Locations
and elevations of bench mark references are available from the
Engineering Department.
b. The location of existing and proposed property lines, streets,

stormwater management system which has not been accepted
Section
420.035
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
420.035
100:889
for maintenance by the City. The responsibility for
maintenance of the system in subdivision projects shall remain
with the developer until such time as the stormwater
management system escrow for such development has been
released. Upon release of escrow, the maintenance
responsibility goes to vested property owners within the
subdivision.
b. The final plat of the subdivision shall contain language
substantially as follows: "The owner of each lot within this
subdivision shall maintain the stormwater management system
serving this subdivision unless the stormwater management
system has been accepted for maintenance by the City of
Washington, Missouri. The maintenance costs shall be shared
equally with each owner of any lot served by the stormwater
management system." There shall also be recorded with the
final plat of the subdivision deed restrictions containing the
same language.
c. The responsibility for maintenance in single-lot development
shall remain with the general contractor and owner until final
inspection of the development is approved and an occupancy
permit is issued. After occupancy, the maintenance of the
management system shall be vested in the owner of the
project.
d. All such privately owned and maintained systems shall be
subject to periodic inspection by the City Engineer or his/her
representative. The City of Washington, Missouri, may, upon
failure of the responsible party to maintain the systems,
maintain the system and charge the cost thereof against the
responsible party. The costs shall be certified to the City Clerk
who shall cause a special tax bill therefor against the property
to be prepared and to be collected by the Collector with other
taxes assessed against the property. The special tax bill from
the date of its issuance shall be a first lien on the property until
paid and shall be prima facie evidence of the recitals therein
and of its validity and no mere clerical error, informality in the
same or in the proceeding leading up the issuance shall be a
defense thereto. Such tax bills if not paid when due shall bear
interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum.
e. A proper access easement to such stormwater management
systems shall be provided, and a minimum ten-foot wide hard
surface designed to support construction traffic with a
maximum twelve percent (12%) grade shall be provided within
such easement. A permeable, flexible plantable concrete block
pavement system is preferred in residential areas.
2. Storage Capacity.
Section
420.035
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
420.035
100:890
a. The rates (pre-developed and post-developed) of runoff shall be
determined for the two-, twenty- and 100-year rainfall
frequencies. The storm duration shall be the twenty-four-hour
event when the SCS TR-55 method is utilized and a minimum
twenty-minute event when the Rational Method is utilized.
Rainfall data shall be determined using the most current
twenty-four-hour rainfall data published by the National
Weather Service (NWS) Technical Paper 40 (TP40).
b. Stormwater shall be detained on site or adjacent property
under agreement and metered out at the rate of an
undeveloped site for the above frequencies and minimum
duration to prevent possible flooding and erosion downstream.
Design criteria to establish this differential runoff rate shall be
as provided in Subsection (B), Design Criteria. Note that
stormwater pipes shall be sized to carry the total developed
tributary upstream water shed. No reduction in pipe size shall
be permitted because of detention.
c. Detention basin volume will be based on providing adequate
storage for the 100-year storm event of the required duration.
Each post-developed runoff hydrograph (two- and 100-year)
shall be routed through the detention facility while satisfying
the appropriate allowable release rate. The routing
computation shall be based on an application of the continuity
principle. The discharge rate shall be based on the maximum
head conditions in the detention facility.
3. Shared Facilities And Regional Detention. The City retains the right
to require on-site detention storage in all cases in which the
proposed development will generate excess runoff that adversely
affects the carrying capacity of the receiving watercourse and/or
adversely affects adjoining property owners. In certain cases the
applicant may make use of off-site or regional detention facilities, in
lieu of on-site facilities, as described below:
a. Off-Site facility, two (2) or more developments: if two (2) or
more developments, including that of the applicant, have
provided for a common system.
b. Off-site facility by City: if an off-site stormwater management
system has been either constructed or programmed or
identified for construction by the City and the applicant has
agreed to contribute to or participate in the construction
thereof. Such contribution shall be determined per the
following Subsection (E)(3)(b)(1).
(1) Stormwater Management Fund.
(a) Eligibility. It is determined that no immediate adverse
effects will result to adjacent property and a
contribution is made to the Stormwater Management
Section
420.035
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
420.035
100:891
Improvements Fund. Such fund is described in
Subsection (E)(3)(b)(1)(c), Establishment Of Fund,
below. Developments which have a differential runoff
of three (3) cfs or less for the ten-year, twenty-minute
event utilizing the Rational Method will be considered
as prime candidates for a contribution in lieu of on-site
detention. It is the City's intention to provide regional
detention storage to accommodate these smaller
developments. The City Council will render all
decisions concerning participation in the Stormwater
Management Fund.
(b) Contribution. The contribution shall be an amount
equal to a cost estimate prepared by a professional
engineer for site specific improvements necessary to
provide detention as provided herein. Such estimate
shall not include the cost of any land necessary for
detention purposes. All cost estimates for site specific
detention facilities shall be subject to review and
approval by the City Engineer. The developer may
request that the City Engineer provide the necessary
cost estimate.
(c) Establishment Of Fund. The Stormwater Management
Improvements Fund shall be and is hereby created.
Said fund shall be reserved for funding improvements
to stormwater systems owned and maintained by the
City and for no other purposes unless authorized in
the ordinance. All contributions made by parties
developing within the City in accordance with
Subsection (E)(3) of this Section shall be deposited to
said fund. Said fund shall be deposited in an interestbearing
account.
c. Other Management Techniques. Management techniques
other than detention facilities may be utilized by the
development, provided that the techniques proposed meet the
intent of this Section and provide a benefit to the watershed
that equals or exceeds the benefit that a detention facility
would provide. Such techniques would include pervious
pavement systems and improved vegetation conditions.
4. General Design Features.
a. Dry Bottom Basins. A stormwater detention facility, natural or
artificial, which normally drains completely between spaced
runoff events, may be constructed to temporarily detain the
stormwater runoff so that the rate at which it is released is the
same rate as before development. The following features shall
be incorporated into the design of any detention basin:
Section
420.035
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
420.035
100:892
(1) Freeboard. Detention storage areas shall have adequate
capacity to contain the storage volume of tributary
stormwater runoff with at least two (2) feet of freeboard
above the water surface.
(2) Outlet Control Works. Outlet works shall be designed to
limit peak outflow rates from detention storage areas to or
below peak flow rates that would have occurred prior to
the proposed development.
(3) Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components
or devices and shall function without requiring attendance
or control during operation, unless specifically approved
by the City Engineer.
(4) Emergency Overflow/Spillway. Emergency structures shall
be provided to permit the safe passage of runoff generated
in excess of the 100-year design storm event. Antivortex
measures shall be provided.
(5) Maximum Depth. The maximum planned depth of
stormwaters stored shall not normally exceed five (5) feet.
(6) Side Slopes. The maximum side slopes for gassed basins
shall not normally exceed one (1) foot vertical for three (3)
feet horizontal.
(7) Limits Of Ponding. In no case shall the limits of maximum
ponding be closer than thirty (30) feet horizontally from
any building and less than two (2) feet vertically below the
lowest sill elevation.
(8) Interior Drainage. The basin should be designed to drain
within a twenty-four-hour period. Flows through the
detention basin should be handled by paved ditch from
inflow structure to outflow structure to minimize erosion.
(9) Multipurpose Basin. If the detention basin is to have other
uses, the design of the basin bottom should include
underdrains to expedite drying of the bottom between
runoff events.
(10) Aesthetics. Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing
configurations which will enhance public acceptability.
b. Wet bottom basin: a stormwater retention facility, natural or
artificial, which maintains a fixed minimum water elevation
between runoff events. Wet bottom basins may also be used to
temporarily detain the differential runoff from the
development. In addition to the general design features
enumerated above for dry bottom basins, the following
Section
420.035
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
420.035
100:893
features should also be incorporated into the design of any wet
bottom basin:
(1) Normal Pool Depth. In order to minimize weed growth, the
normal pool depth should be four (4) feet minimum.
(2) Depth For Fish. If fish are to be kept in the pond, at least
one-fourth (1/4) of the area of the permanent pool should
have a minimum depth of ten (10) feet.
(3) Facilities For Emptying. In order to ease cleaning of the
pond or shoreline maintenance, the pond design should
include provisions for emptying the pond.
(4) Low Flow By-Pass. The design of any pond may include a
low flow by-pass channel or pipeline to divert runoff that
can be accommodated by downstream drainageways.
(5) Side Slopes Below Normal Pool. The side slopes below the
normal pool elevation may exceed the maximum side slope
permitted above normal pool (3:1 slope). The design shall,
however, include provisions for a safety ledge having a
depth of water not greater than three (3) feet immediately
adjacent to the shoreline.
(6) Forebay. In order to minimize siltation of the pond, a
forebay should be included in the design. Calculations for
sediment volume and forebay sizing shall be submitted to
the City Engineer.
c. Rooftop Storage. Detention storage may be met in total or in
part by detention on roofs. Details of such design, which shall
be included in the building permit application, shall include the
depth and volume of storage, details of outlet devices and
down drains, and elevations of overflow provisions. Direct
connection of roof drains to sanitary sewers is prohibited.
d. Parking Lot Storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to
provide temporary detention storage of stormwater on all or a
portion of their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to
slowly empty the stored waters. Depth of storage shall be a
maximum of eight (8) inches.
e. Other Detention Methods. All or a portion of the detention
storage may also be provided in underground or surface
detention facilities, to include basins, tanks or swales, etc.
Emergency overflow conditions shall be considered in all
methods.
5. Plans And Calculations.
a. The following must be submitted for the design of a detention
facility:

control plan has been submitted and approved by the Director of Public
Works or authorized representative. Financial assurance must be given
by the developer/property owner for one hundred thirty percent (130%)
of the estimated cost of the revegetation plan.
F. Sediment And Erosion Control Plan. Where natural vegetation is
removed during grading operations, it shall be replaced as specified
herein. The sediment and erosion control plan shall indicate the
proposed phasing of the project to include conveyance systems,
detention facilities, clearing, rough grading and construction, final
grading, landscaping. When grading operations are substantially
complete or have been suspended for thirty (30) days, revegetation
shall occur. Such revegetation shall meet the below criteria for either
temporary or intermediate seeding.
1. Temporary Seeding. This is the establishment of fast-growing
annual vegetation to provide economical erosion control for up to
twelve (12) months and reduce the amount of sediment moving off
the site. This practice applies when the landscape is anticipated to
be disturbed within the next twelve (12) months. The required
application rates are as follows: one (1) bushel of wheat or oats per
acre; 10-20-10 fertilizer at four hundred (400) pounds per acre;
eighty (80) to one hundred (100) bales of straw mulch per acre.
2. Intermediate Seeding. This is the establishment of perennial
vegetation on disturbed areas for periods longer than twelve (12)
months. This type of vegetation provides economical long-term
erosion control and helps prevent sediment from leaving the site.
The required application rates are the same as for temporary
seeding with the addition of forty (40) to fifty (50) pounds per acre
of fescue grass seed. The application of fescue is not required
during the period of May 15 to August 15. However, it shall be
applied as soon as weather conditions permit following August 15.
G. Reseeding. Reseeding shall occur at any time at the direction of the
Director of Public Works if necessary to obtain the desired erosion
control benefits. Vegetation types other than those specified herein may
be utilized upon approval of the Director.

1992 § 430.010; Ord. No. 16-11557, 8-15-2016, effective 3-1-2017]
It is hereby determined and declared by the Council that in certain portions
of the City obsolete, decadent, substandard, insanitary or blighted areas
exist occasioned by inadequate planning, excessive land coverage, lack
of proper light, air or open space, defective design or arrangement of
buildings, lack of proper sanitary facilities, or the existence of buildings
which, by reason of age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design, or
physical deterioration, have impaired the economic value of large areas,
infecting them with blight, and that such areas are characterized by
depreciated values, impaired investments, reduced or negligible income
and consequent tax delinquencies; that such conditions exist in areas where
obsolete, decadent, substandard, insanitary, outworn or outmoded
industrial, commercial or residential buildings prevail, and the same are
conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality; juvenile
delinquency and crime; that such conditions occur chiefly in areas which
are subdivided into small parcels with multiple ownership and frequently
with confusion as to title; that their assembly for purposes of clearance,
replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction and redevelopment is difficult
and costly; that the existence of such condition and the failure to clear,
replan, and rehabilitate, reconstruct or redevelop these areas results in
progressive deterioration, in a loss of population by the areas, causes
a wasteful expenditure of public funds for policing, and occasions large
outlays for the creation of public facilities and services elsewhere; that
it is impossible and uneconomic for individual owners to independently
undertake to remedy such conditions; that such conditions require the
employment of capital on an investment basis, allowing, however, the widest
latitude in the amortization of any indebtedness created thereby; that such
conditions further require the acquisition of adequate areas at fair prices,
the clearance of such areas through demolition of existing obsolete,
decedent, inadequate, unsafe or insanitary buildings and the redevelopment
of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate planning as to land
use and construction policies; that the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation,
reconstruction and redevelopment of such areas on a large-scale basis are
necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and purposes for which
private property may be acquired by purchase or eminent domain; and
that such obsolete, decadent, substandard, insanitary and blighted areas

project in accordance with the provisions of the development plan, in
the manner and at the time fixed therein for the performance of the
various stages thereof, the Zoning Administrator, upon the written
request of such corporation, shall conduct an investigation and report
to the City Planning and Zoning Commission; and if the City Planning
and Zoning Commission determines that the project has been so
completed, it shall recommend to the City Council that a certificate of
full compliance be issued to such corporation for each State, and the
City Council may authorize the Mayor to issue a certificate of
compliance which shall be conclusive evidence of such compliance,

have power to make and adopt such rules and regulations necessary
and proper to effectuate the purposes of this Chapter.
A. Report. The report of the City Planning and Zoning Commission upon
each development plan shall be filed with the City Clerk, accompanied

the Council may, if it deems desirable, authorize the Mayor to enter into
a contract on behalf of the City with the proposer or proposers of the
plan, such contract to contain the provisions as embodied in the plan,

this Chapter shall be incorporated by reference into such contract,
and a provision that the terms, conditions or provisions of the contract
can be neither modified nor eliminated except by mutual agreement
between the City and the proposer or proposers of the plan; provided,
however, that no such contract shall be construed as an enlargement
of the authority conferred upon the City by the Urban Redevelopment
Corporations Law. The City Clerk shall submit such ordinance, together
with such report and plan, to the Council at its next regular meeting
thereafter.
B. Council Actions. The Council shall be entitled to take any of the

development plan, the Council shall make the following findings and
declarations:

area, and that the clearance, redevelopment, replanning,
rehabilitation or reconstruction thereof is necessary for the public
convenience and necessity.

property within a blighted area by exercise of the power of eminent
domain, such acquisition by the exercise of the power of eminent
domain is for the public convenience and necessity.

name or, in the name of nominees. It may acquire real property by gift,
grant, lease, purchase or otherwise.

corporation operating pursuant to a redevelopment agreement with the
City for a particular redevelopment area, which agreement was
executed prior to or on December 31, 2006, shall have the right to

acquired in like manner, provided that no real property belonging to
the City of Washington, Franklin County, or the State, or any political
subdivision thereof may be acquired without its consent.
D. Certificate Of Public Convenience And Necessity. If the corporation
proposing a development plan seeks to acquire by eminent domain in its
own name, or is requesting that the City acquire all or any part of the
real property described in the development plan, the Council shall, by
the ordinance approving such plan, determine that the public
convenience and necessity will be served by the development plan and

of public convenience and necessity authorizing and empowering such
corporation to acquire by the exercise of eminent domain such real
property in fee simple or other estate, provided that such real property
shall be devoted to the purposes and used subject to the conditions

E. Deposit When City Acquires Property For Corporation.
1. Deposit Amount. If the person or corporation proposing a
development plan seeks to have the City acquire by eminent
domain or otherwise, and thereafter clear, all or any part of the real
property described in the development plan, such person or
corporation shall, at the time hereinafter provided, deposit in
escrow with the City Clerk, subject to the provisions of this
Chapter, a sum of money in cash or negotiable Federal or municipal
securities of a cash market value equal to the cost estimated by the
City Planning and Zoning Commission to be incurred by the City in
acquiring and clearing such real property, conditioned as hereafter
provided that such deposit shall constitute a bid for such real

Department.
4. Custody Of Securities. All securities deposited in escrow with the

box under the joint control of the Mayor and City Clerk. Access to
such box may be had at any time by both of such persons.
F. Encumbrance Of Property. An urban redevelopment corporation may
borrow funds and secure the repayment thereof by mortgage, which
shall contain reasonable amortization provisions and shall be a lien
upon no other real property except that forming the whole or a part of a
single development area. Any mortgage on the real property in a
development area, or any part thereof, may create a first lien, or a
second or junior lien, upon such real property.
G. Disposal Of Property. An urban redevelopment corporation may sell or
otherwise dispose of any or all of the real property acquired by it for the
purpose of a redevelopment project. The ordinance approving any
development plan, and any contract entered into pursuant thereto, may
provide that in the event of the sale or other disposition of real property
of any urban redevelopment corporation by reason of the foreclosure of
any mortgage or other lien through insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings, or by order of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by
voluntary transfer or otherwise, the partial tax relief provided under
Section 430.095 of this Chapter shall inure to any purchaser of such
real property so long as such purchaser shall continue to use, operate
and maintain such real property in accordance with the provisions of
the development plan. If such ordinance and contract do not so provide
and the purchaser of such real property shall continue to use, operate
and maintain such real property in accordance with the provisions of
the redevelopment plan, the Council may grant the partial tax relief
provided in Section 430.095. If such real property shall be used for a
purpose different than that described in the redevelopment plan, or if
the purchaser does not desire the property to continue under the
redevelopment plan, or if the ordinance approving the plan does not
provide for continuing tax relief and the City Council shall refuse to
grant the purchaser continuing tax relief, the real property shall be
assessed for ad valorem taxes upon the full true value of the real
property and may be owned and operated free from any of the
conditions, restrictions or provisions of this Chapter.
A. Assessment Or Payment Of General Ad Valorem Taxes. Once the
requirements of this Section have been complied with, the real property
of urban redevelopment corporations acquired pursuant to this Chapter
shall not be subject to assessment or payment of general ad valorem
taxes imposed by the City affected by this law, or by the State or any
political subdivision thereof, for a period not in excess of ten (10) years
Section
430.090
WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
430.095
100:932
after the date upon which such corporations become owners of such
real property, except to such extent and in such amount as may be
imposed upon such real property during such period, measured solely
by the amount of the assessed valuation of the land, exclusive of
improvements, acquired pursuant to this Chapter and owned by such
urban redevelopment corporation, as was determined by the Assessor
of the County in which such real property is located, or, if not located
within a County, then by the Assessor of such City for taxes due and
payable thereon during the calendar year preceding the calendar year
during which the corporation acquired title to such real property. The
amounts of such tax assessments shall not be increased during such
period so long as the real property is owned by an urban redevelopment
corporation and used in accordance with a development plan
authorized by the City.
B. Property Tax Exempt Prior To Ownership. In the event, however, that
any such real property was tax exempt immediately prior to ownership
by any urban redevelopment corporation, such Assessor or Assessors
shall, upon acquisition of title thereto by the urban redevelopment
corporation, promptly assess such land, exclusive of improvements, at
such valuation as shall conform to but not exceed the assessed
valuation made during the preceding calendar year of other land,
exclusive of improvements adjacent thereto or in the same general
neighborhood, and the amount of such assessed valuation shall not be
increased during the period set pursuant to Subsection (A) of this
Section so long as the real property is owned by an urban
redevelopment corporation and used in accordance with a development
plan authorized by the City. For the next ensuing period not in excess of
fifteen (15) years, ad valorem taxes upon such real property shall be
measured by the assessed valuation thereof as determined by such
Assessor or Assessors upon the basis of not to exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the true value of such real property, including any
improvements thereon, nor shall such valuations be increased above
fifty percent (50%) of the true value of such real property from year to
year during such next ensuing period so long as the real property is
owned by an urban redevelopment corporation and used in accordance
with an authorized development plan. After a period totaling not more
than twenty-five (25) years, such real property shall be subject to
assessment and payment of all ad valorem taxes, based on the full true
value of the real property, provided that after the completion of the
redevelopment project, as authorized by law or ordinance whenever
any urban redevelopment corporation shall elect to pay full taxes, or at
the expiration of the period, such real property shall be owned and
operated free from any of the conditions, restrictions or provisions of
this Chapter, and of any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted pursuant
thereto, any other law limiting the right of domestic and foreign
insurance companies to own and operate real estate to the contrary
notwithstanding.

C. Tax Abatement Or Exemption. No tax abatement or exemption
authorized by this Section shall become effective unless and until the
City Council:
1. Furnishes each political subdivision whose boundaries for ad
valorem taxation purposes include any portion of the real property
to be affected by such tax abatement or exemption with a written
statement of the impact on ad valorem taxes such tax abatement or
exemption will have on such political subdivisions and written
notice of hearing to be held in accordance with Subsection (C)(2) of
this Section. The written statement and notice required by this
Subsection shall be furnished as provided by local ordinance before
the hearing and shall include, but need not be limited to, an
estimate of the amount of ad valorem tax revenues of each political
subdivision which will be affected by the proposed tax abatement
or exemption, based on the estimated assessed valuation of the real
property involved as such property would exist before and after it is
redeveloped.
2. Conducts a public hearing regarding such tax abatement or
exemption, at which hearing all political subdivisions described in
Subsection (C)(1) of this Section shall have the right to be heard on
such grant of tax abatement or exemption.
3. Enacts an ordinance which provides for expiration of development
rights, including the rights of eminent domain and tax abatement,
in the event of failure of the urban redevelopment corporation to
acquire ownership of property within the area of the development
plan. Such ordinance shall provide for a duration of time within
which such property must be acquired, and may allow for
acquisition of property under the plan in phases.
D. Payments In Lieu Of Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law
to the contrary, payments in lieu of taxes may be imposed by contract
between the City and an urban redevelopment corporation which
receives tax abatement or exemption on property pursuant to this
Section. Such payments shall be made to the Collector of Revenue of
the County by December 31 of each year payments are due. The City
Council shall furnish the Collector a copy of any such contract requiring
payment in lieu of taxes. The Collector shall allocate all revenues
received from such payment in lieu of taxes among all taxing authorities
whose property tax revenues are affected by the exemption or
abatement on the same pro rata basis and in the same manner as the ad
valorem property tax revenues received by each taxing authority from
such property in the year such payments are due.
E. Applicability. The provisions of Subsection (C) of this Section shall not
apply to any amendment or future amendment to a phased development
plan approved by the City Council prior to the effective date of the
provisions of Subsection (C) of this Section and upon which
construction has been in progress pursuant to such phased plan.

interlineations in it or by issuing a new tax bill in lieu of the erroneous
one, but when a tax bill is corrected by interlineations the date of making

bill. In any action brought on any such tax bill the court shall have power
to correct any error in the amount of the tax bill, and in any case where
it may be shown that the work done was not as good as required by the
contract, the court may give judgment for the reasonable value of the work
chargeable against the land described in the tax bill. The City Clerk shall
keep a record of all tax bills issued by the City in a special book provided for

shall file with the City Clerk; and thereupon such Clerk shall note the filing
of the receipt on the margin of the abstract of the tax bill, and shall mark
the latter canceled and shall affix his/her name to such cancellation, with
the date thereof. Such cancellation shall have the effect to extinguish all
liability or right of action of such tax bill. The Collector, on the presentation
to him/her of such tax bill by its owner, shall pay to him/her the amount
thereof, take his/her duplicate receipt therefor, one (1) of which he/she shall
file with the City Clerk, who shall note it on the margin of abstract of the
tax bill, and the other the Collector shall retain. The Collector shall be liable

Article. If the Council shall, in the resolution provided for in Section 505.110
declare that the cost of the proposed work, not to exceed an amount per

borne by the general revenue, and only that part of the cost limited to such
stated amount per foot shall be charged against the abutting property. In

at a greater sum than was stated in the notice required by Section
505.140.
B. The City Council is hereby empowered to adjust or reduce such
assessment which is determined to be excessive or levied at a greater
sum than was stated in the notice. If such adjustment or reduction
results in the collection of special taxes insufficient to pay the cost of
work done or improvements made, the City may pay the difference
between cost accrued and special taxes collected out of the general
revenue.

No person shall make or cause to be made, or help, aid or assist therein,
any excavation on any public street, highway, alley or other public place or
any public easement or right-of-way without first having made application
to the City Engineer for a permit for such excavation and receiving from
the City Engineer a written permit to proceed. Before such permit shall be
granted, the applicant shall deposit an amount based on the City Engineer's
estimated cost of restoration of the excavated pavement. Such deposit
may be used to restore the street, highway, alley or other public place,
public easement or right-of-way in as good condition as it was before the
excavation was made and in accordance with the conditions provided in this
Article. In addition to such deposit the applicant shall pay an equal amount
to compensate the City for the restoration of any excavated pavement. A
permit fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) shall also be paid.

The deposit shall be returned to the depositor not later than six (6) months
after the work shall have been completed, inspected, and the place restored
to its original condition and in accordance with the provisions of this
Article. This maximum six-month time frame shall serve as a warranty
period. Factors that will determine the length of deposit time shall include
the extent of backfill required, the type of pavement restoration, and the
traffic conditions the excavation will experience. If the restored excavation
fails due to backfill settlement the deposit will be forfeited. The City shall
thereafter cause the excavation to be restored utilizing the forfeited deposit
to pay for the costs of restoration. If the deposit is not sufficient to pay
the entire costs thereof, the depositor shall be required to pay the balance
thereof. Any excess deposit shall be returned to the depositor.

[R.O. 1992 § 505.850; Ord. No. 4459 § 1 9-16-1974]
If the City has caused to be constructed or reconstructed any sewer,
boulevard, street, alley, sidewalk, curb and gutter or other local
improvements, and to pay the cost of the improvement has levied a special
assessment against private property and issued special tax bills pursuant
thereto, and the assessment or any part therefor or the special tax bills or
any part thereof are adjudged invalid or unenforceable either in whole or in
part by the final judgment of any Appellate Court of competent jurisdiction
for any reason other than the failure of the contractor who has done the
work to fully comply with his/her contract, the City may, by ordinance,
make a new assessment or reassessment upon all land benefitted by the
improvement, and in so doing, may if necessary, create a new assessment
district and define its boundaries.
Section 505.710. Proposed Reassessment — Hearing Of
Objections.153 [R.O. 1992 § 505.860; Ord. No. 4459 § 2, 9-16-1974]
Before any ordinance making provision for such reassessment or the
creation of such assessment district shall be put upon its passage the City
Council shall appoint a day upon which it will hear and consider any and
all objections to such ordinance and shall give public notice of the time and
place and matter thus to be considered which said notice shall be addressed
to all persons interested, shall set forth in full the pending ordinance,
shall state that at the appointed time and place all landowners within the
assessment district defined by said ordinance and all persons interested,
may appear before the City Council and be heard upon all matters pertinent
to said ordinance, and shall be published once a week for two (2) weeks,
the last publication to be at least one (1) week before such day of hearing
in some newspaper in general circulation published in the City. After said
hearing has been had, said ordinance may be passed, rejected or amended
as justice may require.

Such ordinance shall set forth the total amount of such new assessment and
shall provide in what manner it shall be apportioned among the various lots
and parcels of land included within the assessment district in said ordinance
defined, giving due credit to each and every lot and parcel of land entitled
thereto for all payments on a previous assessment for the improvement in
question that shall appear from the City records to have been made on

§ 505.880; Ord. No. 4459 § 4, 9-16-1974]
The total amount of such new assessment shall be in such sum as is
equitable under all circumstances. It shall in no case exceed that part of the
previous assessment that is invalid and is unpaid at the time the ordinance
levying the new assessment is introduced and where, because of lack of
competitive bidding, or other cause, the value of the improvement, when
made, was less than the contract price thereof, then the new assessment
shall not exceed the fair value of the improvement in said time less all
payments made on the original assessment and the amount of such part
of the original assessment as is valid. No lot or parcel of land shall be
assessed by said ordinance in a greater amount then the difference between
the amount of the benefits it shall have received from the improvement
and the credits to which it is entitled under Section 505.720; provided,
however, that if through error or misconstruction, the amount of the new
assessment should, in any case, be excessive under this provision because
of the failure to give a proper credit or credits under Section 505.720, the
new assessment shall not thereby be avoided, but any person owning or
pecuniarily interested in any property which shall not have received due
credit under the aforesaid provision shall be entitled to a proper reduction
in an amount, in any proceeding brought to enforce such assessment or tax
bill, or in any appropriate proceeding instituted for the purpose by him/her
or them in the Circuit Court of the County.
Section 505.740. Ordinance To Be Conclusive.156 [R.O. 1992
§ 505.890; Ord. No. 4459 § 5, 9-16-1974]
The final passage of any ordinance under the provisions of this Article shall
be deemed a conclusive determination that the amount of the assessment
therein made is in conformity with Section 505.730 and that each lot or
parcel of land within the assessment district by such ordinance defined has
been benefitted by the improvement in question in an amount at least equal
to the assessment charged against it by such ordinance, plus all credits to
which it is entitled under Section 505.720.
Section 505.750. New Tax Bills Issued.157 [R.O. 1992 § 505.900; Ord.

As soon as may be after such ordinance has come into effect, special tax
bills in favor of the record holder of the original defective bills against
the various lots, tracts and parcels of land included within the assessment
district in said ordinance defined shall be issued pursuant thereto by the

improvements.

Assessment.158 [R.O. 1992 § 505.910; Ord. No. 4459 § 7, 9-16-1974]
This Article shall be liberally construed so as to prevent private property
that has been in good faith benefitted by local public improvements from
escaping payment of its just share of the value thereof; and shall apply to
all cases wherein original assessments for local improvements are made.
No reassessment shall be made under this Article unless the ordinance
authorizing it is passed and becomes effective within two (2) years after
the previous assessment has been declared to be avoided, in whole or in
part. Parts of previous assessments which are not invalid under the ruling of
some Appellate Court of competent jurisdiction are not in any way affected
by Sections 505.700 through 505.750.

mains of the City at any points in the streets of the City from such water
mains to the building served, unless such water service pipe is made or
therefor and payment of such rate in advance, make use of any
hose connection with the water system for sprinkling streets.
8. The City reserves the right to shut off the supply of water from any
consumer at any time when, and so long as, the service pipe
through which such consumer may be supplied or any meter or
other part of such pipe may be out of order for the proper supply of
water through same.
9. The Superintendent shall have the right and it shall be his/her duty
to inspect meters and all other fixtures and appliances for the use
of water whenever deemed necessary by him/her or the City for the
purpose of regulating such use, keeping an accurate account
thereof and preventing waste, leakage, or other violations of the
rules and regulations; and for such purpose it shall be the duty of
the water consumers to allow the Superintendent access to their
valves and meters at reasonable times and intervals; and for refusal
to allow such access, upon order of the City, the water supply may
be cut off and withheld from any person so refusing.

line at the point five (5) feet from the building to allow for the change from
K copper to high-density PVC pipe. The curb valve shall be Mueller inverted
Minneapolis pattern or its equal. The curb box shall be Mueller Minneapolis
pattern with top section one and one-fourth (1 1/4) inches in diameter, or
its equal. The curb valve and box shall be the property of the owner or his/
her agents and shall be kept in such condition by him/her so that access
to the curb valve may be had at any time by representatives of the Water
Department. All pipes shall be laid to a depth of not less than three (3)
feet under the ground measured from the established grade of the street or
alley. All service pipe shall be not less than three-fourths (3/4) inch at the
time of installation. All service lines shall also have installed an approved
valve on the inlet side of the meter at the immediate entry into the building
or meter pit. Upon completion of installation of service lines, the City shall
retain ownership of the service line from the main to the shutoff valve at the
customer's property line, and the consumer shall retain ownership of the
service line from and including the curb valve to the meter.

A. Every consumer, before using water from City water mains, excepting
the rules and regulations shall install at his/her cost an approved water
meter, said meter shall be installed horizontally in the service line, and
shall be set at the immediate entry of the building to be served. Where
it becomes necessary that a meter be set outside a residence or
building, said meter shall be installed in a meter yolk equipped with a
shutoff valve on the inlet side. The meter and yolk shall be properly
Section
700.020
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section

100:1055
installed within a meter pit. The meter yolk, style and size of the pit
shall be approved by the Board of Public Works or its representative,
prior to installation.
B. In any case, where water is to be used for an underground lawn
sprinkling system, a separate meter may be installed for such sprinkling
operations, at the expense of the consumer. Water measured through
this meter shall be billed as water usage only, and shall not have sewer
service charges assessed. Location of sprinkler service meters shall be
approved by members of the City Water Department prior to sprinkler
system start up. All sprinkler and irrigation systems shall be equipped
with an approved backflow device as explained in Section 700.140 of
the Code.
C. All meters shall be subject to inspection by representatives of the Water
Department at reasonable hours. The Water Department reserves the
right to test, repair, or replace the meter if necessary. Such test, repair,
or replacement shall be at the expense of the City, providing the meter
is not larger than two (2) inches.
D. Any customer may request a meter test of the meter on their property.
The City shall perform such test, if the request is reasonable, by
comparing the meter to a calibrated meter or other accurate standards
using approved industry methods. If the results of each test show that
the meter is accurate within two percent (2%), the customer requesting
the test shall pay the City for all expenses incurred in making the test. If
the meter is found to register two or more percent (2%+) above or
below normal, the City will bear the expense of the tests and the
readings of that meter previously taken for billing purposes shall be
corrected for the disputed time period, not to exceed ninety (90) days,
and the customer's bill shall be adjusted upward or downward
according to the percentage of inaccuracy found.
E. Charges for performing a meter test shall be the actual cost of labor
and equipment, plus appropriate overhead, as incurred by the City of
Washington, unless otherwise set by City ordinance.
F. The City of Washington encourages customers to use discretion in
requesting meter tests in order to avoid unnecessary expenses, because
meters - like any mechanical device -become worn with use, which
increases friction and results in the meter running slower than normal.
It is only in rare cases when a meter will register more than the actual
quantity. The City of Washington will advise customers in these matters
when requested to do so.
G. All meters sized five-eighths (5/8) inch through one (1) inch in need of
repair or found to be inaccurate in excess of industry standards will be
repaired or replaced at the expense of the City of Washington. All
meters in excess of one (1) inch shall be kept in repair by the consumer
at his/her expense.

water, or any device, either permanent or temporary, through
which backflow can occur is considered a cross-connection and is
strictly prohibited.
2. Representatives of the Board of Public Works shall have the right to
inspect any property at any time if they suspect that a crossconnection
has been allowed to occur. All consumers shall allow
access to their property by the Superintendent of the Board of
Public Works or his/her agent at reasonable times and intervals for
the purpose of inspecting the property for possible crossconnections.
3. If a cross-connection is found to exist, the City Board of Public
Works shall notify the consumer and allow fifteen (15) days for the
customer to either remove the cross-connection or install an
approved backflow device to eliminate the hazard. If action has not
been taken to correct the problem within the allowable time of
fifteen (15) days, the City shall have the right to discontinue
service.
4. If in the opinion of the Superintendent of the Board of Public Works
a serious hazard to the health of the citizens of the community is
posed by a cross-connection, the City will discontinue the service
immediately without the fifteen-day notice. All attempts will be

own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted
to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before
construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to
the POTW after the effective date of this Chapter shall be permitted
to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the City. Review and approval of
such plan and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter. In the case of
an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to
immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
B. Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. At least once every two (2)
years, the Superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant

response.
C. Written Notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge,
the user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or
any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification
relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may
be imposed by this Article or other applicable law.
D. The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge after
informal notice to the user whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately
suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond,
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
1. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the
period of endangerment has passed.
2. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the
Superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination
hearing.
3. Nothing in this Subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this Subsection.
E. Notice To Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call on in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employees shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification
procedures.

monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in Section
705.800(A)(2)(d), (e), and (f) of this Chapter, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
[Comment: Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the EPA publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures
for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April
1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and
analytical procedures approved by the EPA Administrator.]

WASHINGTON CITY CODE Section
705.800
100:1130
1. The Superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under Section 705.780 of this Chapter.
2. The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under Section 705.780 of this Chapter or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under Section 705.790(C) of this
Chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
3. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of fifteen percent (15%) or
greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
F. Reports Of Potential Problems.
1. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature,
a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the Superintendent of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user.
2. Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage,
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
Chapter.
3. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in Subsection (F)(1) above.
Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a
discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
G. Reports From Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
H. Notice Of Violation/Repeal Sampling And Reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
Section
705.800
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
705.800
100:1131
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within
thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is
not required to resample if the Superintendent monitors at the user's
facility at least once a month, or if the Superintendent samples between
the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this
sampling.
I. Notification Of The Discharge Of Hazardous Waste.
1. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain
the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user; an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged
during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place
no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this Subsection (I)(1) need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted
under Section 705.800(E) of this Chapter. The notification
requirement in this Section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
under the self-monitoring requirements of Section 705.800(A) ,(C),
and (D) of this Chapter.
2. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection (I)(1)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes
are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(e) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
3. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA183
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
183. Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 6921.

purpose of this Chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the City or their representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose
of inspection, sampling, records examination, or copying, or in the
performance of any of their duties. The City, approval authority and (where
the NPDES State is the approval authority) EPA shall have the right to
set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must
notify the Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of
the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of such regulations.
4. In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
5. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Chapter, a permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
A. The City shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems.
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical
or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed
in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facilities to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
C. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City's
requirements and all applicable local construction specifications.
Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following
written notification by the City.

comply with this Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall
be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be acceptable to the
City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will not in any way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operations shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to
the user's initiation of the changes.
B. The Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily
newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a
list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
significant non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term "significant non-compliance" shall mean:
1. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater
measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily
maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter
by any amount;
2. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater
measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a sixmonth
period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum

required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
7. Failure to accurately report non-compliance; or
8. Any other violation(s) which the Superintendent determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
C. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon
request.
A. Confidential Information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the
Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available
to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests,
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes,
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information
should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately
upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES
program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR
