PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Nixa, Missouri. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Prior Code, as supplemented through October 16, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Prior Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Paula B. Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Brian Bingle, City Administrator, Ms. Judy Long, City Clerk, and Mr. Pat Sweeney, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

For the purpose of this section, the terms "vicious" and "dangerous" are considered synonymous, and from this point forward the use of one term shall be applicable to the other. A dog or other animal shall be considered dangerous by virtue of:

An offensive animal shall be any dog or other animal that inflicts a non-severe injury substantially different in nature than that which is described under subsection (a) of this section or exempt under this subsection (b) of this section, and shall be determined after an investigation by the animal control officer. 
(c)  Otherwise, a dog or animal may be declared vicious/dangerous if: 
(1)  A written complaint (citation) is signed by the individual attacked or their legal guardian, or by the animal control officer, police officer or his designee.

(d)  Any dog or other animal having a dangerous dog or animal complaint initiated against such animal shall be securely impounded at an approved location by the animal control officer until determination of guilt occurs in municipal court for the city or circuit court of the county. The owner of said dog or other animal shall be responsible for all costs incurred per sections of this Code while said animal is impounded. Any animal not reclaimed (if allowed by the court) by its owner within five days after the judicial action is completed shall be disposed of pursuant to this Code. 
(e)  Any person charged with a violation of this section who, having been duly notified fails to appear in the municipal court for the city or circuit court of the county, shall, upon order of the court, waive their right to redeem their dog or other animal. The dog or other animal shall be disposed of pursuant to this Code. 
(f)  Any dog or other animal deemed dangerous under this Code shall not be sold or given away without prior notification to the animal control officer. The person buying or receiving said animal shall provide their address and/or any other pertinent information desired by the animal control officer. 
(g)  No dog or other animal shall be declared dangerous pursuant to any part of this section if the threat, injury or damage caused by said dog or animal was sustained by a person who, at the time, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog or animal, or was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog or animal, or was committing or attempting to commit any crime. Nor shall any dog or other animal be declared dangerous if it was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel or offspring. Dogs utilized as part of a K-9 police program and supervised by police personnel are exempt from these regulations during the performance of official duty. 
(h)  Upon the declaration of "dangerous" for any dog or other animal by any court, the following sanctions may be imposed upon the owner: 
(1)  Any dog or other animal that inflicts a severe or fatal injury upon a human being may be deemed an imminent threat to the public and ordered removed from the city limits or humanely euthanized by the court. 
(2)  Upon conviction of any person for violating any required portion of these sanctions, the municipal court judge may, in addition to the usual judgment, order the animal control officer to forthwith take up and humanely euthanize said animal. 
(3)  Sanctions imposed by the court are to be implemented to the animal control officer's satisfaction within seven days after the court ruling, or the dog or other animal may not be reclaimed and may be disposed of pursuant to this Code.

Sec. 14-26. - Nuisance abatement. 
(a)  Summary abatement of nuisances. 
(1)  Procedure. Whenever a complaint is made to the code compliance official or upon discovery of the existence of a nuisance, as defined in this chapter, the code official shall promptly cause to be inspected the property on which it is alleged that such nuisance exists. Upon discovery of a nuisance, the code compliance official may order the owner or other person creating, keeping, maintaining, or permitting the same to abate it. Should the code official find that a public nuisance exists, and the public health, welfare or safety may be in immediate danger, then summary abatement procedures shall be implemented and the inspecting official or department may cause the nuisance to be removed or abated. Summary abatement costs shall be certified by the city clerk and assigned to the annual real estate tax bills for the property. 
(2)  Notice. When summary abatement is authorized, notice to the owner, agent, or occupant of the property is not required. Following summary abatement, the code compliance official shall cause to be posted on the property liable for the abatement a notice describing the action taken to abate the nuisance. 
(b)  Abatement of nuisances in other cases. 
(1)  Procedure. Whenever a compliant is made to the code compliance official or upon discovery of a nuisance that does not pose an immediate danger to the public health, welfare or safety, the code compliance official shall submit a written report of the property on which the nuisance exists to the city administrator or his designee. If the code compliance official declares the existence of a nuisance, but the nature thereof is not such as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, then the city administrator, or his designee, may order the abatement of the nuisance after notice and a hearing pursuant to sections 14-27 and 14-28. 
(2)  Abatement by owner. Within ten days after service of the notice to abate the nuisance, the owner or individual in possession of the affected property shall remove and abate such nuisance or show that actions for abating the nuisance have been commenced. Such showing shall be made by filing a written statement or other proof of such actions with the code compliance official. 
(c)  Abatement by city. If the city administrator or his designee, after a hearing in compliance with this section, finds that the nuisance or dangerous condition exists, the chief of police or the code compliance official shall have authority to enter upon the property and abate the nuisance found thereon. In abating such nuisance, the chief of police or code compliance official may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete the abatement of the nuisance. If it is practicable to salvage any material derived in the aforesaid abatement, the chief of police or code compliance official may sell the salvage material at private or public sale and shall keep an accounting of the proceeds thereof. 
(d)  Proceeds from sale of private property. The proceeds, if any, obtained from the sale of any material salvaged as a result of an abatement of public nuisance by the code compliance official or chief of police shall be deposited into the general fund of the city and any deficit between the amount so received and the cost of the abatement shall be filed with the city clerk. The city clerk shall certify said costs and submit a special tax bill to the assessor so that the costs can be added to the annual real estate tax bill for the property. Should the proceeds of the sale of the salvaged material exceed the cost of abatement, the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the owner of the property from which the public nuisance was abated when a proper claim to the excess is established. 
(e)  Authorized action. In abating a public nuisance, the code compliance official or chief of police may call upon any of the city departments or divisions for whatever assistance shall be deemed necessary or may by private contract cause the abatement of the public nuisance. 
(f)  Statement of costs. The city is hereby empowered to charge and collect all costs of any abatement which is performed by the city, including administrative expenses, which shall be determined by the code compliance official, chief of police, planning and development department officials or his designees and/or municipal court. Said costs shall be reported to the city administrator or his designee in an itemized document titled "certificate of cost" showing the costs of abatement, administrative expenses and any outstanding penalties. Said costs shall be assessed and billed to the owner, occupant or entity having control of the property upon which the violation exists along with a notice advising that a special tax bill shall be issued and that the costs of the abatement will be added to the annual real estate taxes assessed against the property if the costs are not paid within 30 days. The person or entity causing, maintaining, or permitting the nuisance shall be personally liable to the city for the cost of such abatement. 
(g)  Appeal of cost statements. The property owner, occupants, or entities having control of the property may object to the assessment discussed in subsection (f) of this section. Such objections must be made in writing with 20 days from the date of mailing of the notice discussed in subsection (f) of this section. If no objections are received within the 20-day period, the city clerk is to proceed with the procedures set forth in subsection (h) of this section. If an objection is received, the city clerk shall refer the matter to the city administrator, or his designee, for administrative review. After administrative review, the city administrator, or his designee, shall make a written determination that the amount of the charges shall be canceled, reduced or remain the same. The city administrator, or his designee, may reduce or cancel the proposed assessment if it is determined that: no notice of order to remove the nuisance was provided; or the work performed for abating the nuisance was not in compliance with this chapter; or the computation of charges was not in compliance with this chapter. A copy of this determination shall be furnished to the person making the objections together with a notice of the person's right to appeal. The decision of the city administrator, or his designee, may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of RSMo ch. 536 by any person aggrieved, provided such appeal is filed within 30 days after the date of personal service or mailing of the city administrator's or his designee's decision. 
(h)  Special tax bills and liens upon property. In the event the person or persons billed fails to pay within the 30-day period set forth in this section, the city administrator, or his designee, shall certify the amount thereof to the city clerk. The city clerk shall take any and all steps necessary for a special tax bill to be issued and/or for the costs of the abatement to be added to the annual real estate taxes assessed against the property. The cost of the abatement as determined by the city administrator, or his designee, shall be certified to the city clerk not sooner than 30 days after issuance of the city administrator's, or his designee's written findings, if not sooner paid. The special tax bill, if issued, shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owners and shall be a lien on the property until paid. If the special tax bill is added to the annual real estate bill for the property and is not paid, the real estate taxes shall be considered delinquent and the collection thereof shall be governed by the laws applicable to delinquent real estate taxes. Such special tax bills, if not paid when due, shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum. 
(i)  Claim of lack of notice. If, after a lien has been entered, there is a written request of the owner who alleges that the owner did not receive notice of the proposed assessment, the city clerk shall refer the matter for review pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. The lien may be canceled or reduced by the city administrator, or his designee, in administrative review, if it is determined that the owner did not receive notice of the proposed assessment, did not previously have knowledge of the lien or of the nuisance abatement work constituting the basis of the lien and could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, have had such knowledge, and, in addition, that the circumstances are such that a reduction or cancellation of the charges would have been appropriate had the matter been reviewed pursuant to this section prior to assessment. Upon receipt of a certification from the city administrator, or his designee, pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, the city clerk shall cancel or reduce the lien if required by determination of the city administrator. Even if the lien is reduced or eliminated under this section, the individuals, firms, corporation, or other owners of the property at the time at which the notice was served shall be personally liable for the amount of assessment including all interest, civil penalties and other charges.

(3)  Make written findings of fact from the evidence offered at said hearing as to whether or not the building in question is a dangerous building within the terms of section 14-73.

If the evidence does not support a finding that a building or structure is a dangerous building, no order shall be issued. 
(5)  If the owner, occupant, mortgagee or lessee fails to comply with the order within 30 days, the building commissioner shall cause such building or structure to be repaired, vacated or demolished as the facts may warrant; and the building commissioner shall certify the cost of the work borne by the city for such repair, vacation or demolition to the city clerk as a special assessment represented by a special tax bill against the real property affected; said tax bill shall be lien upon said property and shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner.

(6)  As to damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by and arising out of any fire, explosion or other casualty loss, if an order is issued by the building commissioner as provided in subsection (5) of this section, and a special tax bill or assessment is issued against the property, it shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner.

This subsection shall apply only to a covered claim payment that is in excess of 50 percent of the face value of the policy covering a building or other structure: 
a.  The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to 25 percent of the covered claim payment, and shall pay such moneys to the city to deposit into an interest-bearing account.

If the city has proceeded under the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, all moneys in excess of that necessary to comply with the provisions of subsection (5) of this section for the removal of the building or structure, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured. 
(7)  If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in subsection (6) of this section, at the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period not more than ten years. The tax bill from date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property and a personal debt against the property owner until paid. 
(8)  Subsection (6) of this section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and structures. 
(9)  Subsection (6) of this section does not make the city a party to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable to any party for an amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance policy. 
(10)  The building commissioner may certify in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim under subsection (6) that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In this event, the building commissioner shall issue a certificate within 30 days after receipt of proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without the deduction pursuant to subsection (6) of this section. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other person making the claim to provide the insurance company with the written certificate provided from this subsection.

b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection;

b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 20-183, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown; 
b.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 20-183, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway; 
c.

(a)  The city administrator, after considering pumping capacity, water level in storage tanks, water level in production wells, water usage rates, weather and drought conditions and such other factors as may be deemed relevant, may declare a Stage I, II or III Emergency, and when so declared, no person shall use or draw water from the city's water distribution system in violation of the restrictions on usage applicable to the state of emergency declared by the city administrator. 
(b)  Prior to declaring a state of emergency, the city administrator shall enter into the records of the city findings of fact upon which he based his decision and shall thereupon enter his order declaring an emergency, specifying whether the emergency is of a Stage I, II or III type. He, and all city agents, officers, and employees upon whom he may call for assistance, shall thereupon proceed to implement the provisions of this section as the conditions may require. 
(c)  The fact of the declaration of emergency, the type of emergency, and the restrictions on usages applicable to that type of declaration shall be disseminated to the general public through the local broadcast and print media and in such other manners as the city administrator may determine is reasonably calculated to inform the residents of and visitors to the city of the declaration. If reasonable efforts to bring the declaration of emergency to the public have been made, considering the seriousness of the conditions, the time available, and the media or means available for the dissemination of information, lack of knowledge of the declaration of emergency shall be no defense to a violation of this section. 
(d)  (1)  As used herein, the term "Stage I Emergency" means that it shall be unlawful for water to be used from the water distribution system for the watering of grasses, lawns, gardens, trees, shrubs, or similar vegetation; to wash any building, sidewalks, driveways or any outdoor structure; to fill or refill any pools, hot tubs, tanks or other vessels not used for direct public health and welfare except when done in compliance with a watering schedule established by the city administrator and advertised to the public pursuant to Subsection (c) of this section. It shall be unlawful to wash motor vehicles of any type, trailers of any type, and other automotive or boating equipment except when done in compliance with a watering schedule established by the city administrator or at a car wash that has, prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, been issued a business license by the city for that purpose. 
(2)  Water rates for 5/8 × ¾ residential service connections during a Stage I Emergency will be adjusted. All water used in excess of 15,000 but less than 25,000 will be charged at a rate 25 percent higher than the regular rate per 1,000 gallons. All water used in excess of 25,000 will be charged at a rate 50 percent higher than the regular rate per 1,000 gallons. 
(3)  Bulk water rates during a Stage I Emergency will be charged at a rate 50 percent higher than the regular rate for bulk water per 1,000 gallons. 
(e)  (1)  As used herein, the term "Stage II Emergency" means that it shall be unlawful for water to be used from the water distribution system for the watering of grasses, lawns, gardens, trees, shrubs, or similar vegetation; to wash any building, sidewalks, driveways or any outdoor structure; to fill or refill any pools, hot tubs, tanks or other vessels not used for direct public health and welfare. It shall be unlawful to wash motor vehicles of any type, trailers of any type, and other automotive or boating equipment by any means except at a car wash that has, prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, been issued a business license by the city for that purpose; or to draw water from the city water system from any faucet or outlet when such water is not being used for ordinary and usual domestic, commercial, or industrial purpose. 
(2)  Water rates for 5/8 × ¾ residential service connections during a Stage II emergency will be adjusted. All water used in excess of 15,000 but less than 25,000 will be charged at a rate 25 percent higher than the Stage I rate per 1,000 gallons. All water used in excess of 25,000 will be charged at a rate 50 percent higher than the Stage I rate per 1,000 gallons. 
(3)  Bulk water rates during a Stage II Emergency will be charged at a rate 50 percent higher than the Stage I rate for bulk water per 1,000 gallons. 
(f)  (1)  As used herein, the term "Stage III Emergency" means that conditions on the distribution system are critical and all efforts are for securing the water supply for the health and welfare of the citizens. During a Stage III emergency, it shall be unlawful to use water in any manner for the watering of grasses, lawns, gardens, trees, shrubs, or similar vegetation under any conditions or by any means; or to wash any motor vehicle, trailer, or other automotive or boating equipment; or to wash any building, sidewalks, driveways or any outdoor structure under any conditions or by any means, including at a commercial car wash, or to fill or refill any pools, hot tubs, tanks or other vessels not used for direct public health and welfare. 
(2)  Water rates for 5/8 × ¾ residential service connections during a Stage III Emergency will be adjusted. All water used in excess of 15,000 but less than 25,000 will be charged at a rate 25 percent higher than the Stage II rate per 1,000 gallons. All water used in excess of 25,000 will be charged at a rate 50 percent higher than the Stage II rate per 1,000 gallons. 
(3)  Violations for a Stage III Emergency may result in the loss of service. During a Stage III Emergency, the city may curtail service by removing the water meter and capping the service until outstanding accounts have been satisfied per subsection (h)(4) of this section. Further violation may result in the loss of service until the state of emergency is reduced to Stage I. 
(4)  During a Stage III Emergency, no bulk water service is available. A bulk service customer who uses water during a Stage III Emergency shall be charged a rate of 100 percent higher than the Stage II rate per 1,000 gallons and the loss of service until the Emergency level has been removed. Further use shall be considered theft. 
(g)  At the next regular or special meeting of the city council following the declaration of an emergency of either stage by the city administrator, the city council shall review the findings of fact and declaration of the city administrator. After making such review, the council shall either confirm the actions of the city administrator, reduce the stage of emergency or overturn the declaration in its entirety; provided, however, that no action of the council to reduce the stage of emergency declared by the city administrator or to overturn a declaration of emergency shall be effective unless such action is approved by the majority vote of all the members of the council then-elected or appointed and serving on the council. Further, no action of the council in reducing the stage of emergency or overturning the action of the city administrator in declaring an emergency shall be a defense to a charge of violating the provisions of this section for acts which occurred after the declaration became effective, but prior to its modification or reversal by the city council. 
(h)  The following additional provisions shall be applicable to the provisions of this section: 
(1)  A declaration of emergency made under this section shall continue in full force and effect unless and until the stage of the declaration is increased or reduced (in which event, the prior declaration shall be superseded as of the date and time of the entry of the new declaration), or released by written order of the city administrator or reduced or reversed by action of the city council. 
(2)  In declaring a state of emergency, the city administrator may, if circumstances justify, make the declaration applicable only for specified hours of the day or for certain specified days. 
(3)  No culpable mental state shall be required for a person charged with the violation of the provisions of this section to be found guilty of such violation. The owner or occupant of the premises upon which such illegal use shall occur shall also be deemed guilty of a violation occurring upon any such premises, regardless of the person who shall have committed such illegal use. The preceding sentence shall not be construed as relieving the person actually making such illegal use from responsibility therefor. 
(4)  The water service of any person found guilty of knowingly violating the provisions of this section may be disconnected from the water distribution system, and, if so disconnected, shall not be reconnected until he shall have paid all costs of water used and a disconnection/reconnection fee in the amount established by ordinance which shall be placed in the city water fund. 
(i)  Guidelines and examples for emergency declaration considerations. Because of continually varying conditions on the water distribution system, weather and other environmental factors, any one or combination of occurrences may be considered as benchmarks for the city administrator in making an emergency declaration. Some examples include: 
(1)  Water level in a well or wells that is reduced to within 50 feet above the top of the pump. 
(2)  Water usage in excess of pumping capacity for sustained periods beyond normal operations. 
(3)  Storage capacity in one or more towers being reduced during peak periods below minimum levels for sustained periods. 
(4)  System component failure, such as a well pump failure, large water leak or large fire combined with any of subsections (i)(1)(3) of this section or during peak usage times that could cause any of the above factors to occur. 
(j)  City facilities and operations. During a declared water system emergency, all city departments and facilities shall reduce certain operations that may contribute to further escalation of the emergency. During declared periods, all departments shall: 
(1)  Reduce all outdoor watering to the level implemented for other users. During a Stage I Emergency, reduce outdoor watering to only recreational fields, shrubs, flowerbeds and trees. 
(2)  During Stage II and III Emergency, stop all outdoor watering. Cease all nonessential outdoor watering of grass areas in yards and open spaces. 
(3)  During all stages, cease all vehicle and equipment and other washing except where necessary for operations. 
(4)  During Stage I Emergency, reduce hydrant or system flushing to only essential operations necessary to maintain the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. Increase discretion with increased stages.

(Prior Code, § 17-59; Ord. No. 1747, § 17-59, 8-8-2012)  
Sec. 22-219. - Grease trap installation for food service establishments (FSE). 
(a)  The objective of fats, oils and grease (FOG) management by removal before it reaches the sewer collection system is to minimize blockages and the resulting sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) from occurring and to protect the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and other residential and commercial entities tributary to the city's wastewater collection system, and ultimately protect human health and the natural resources of the state. No FSE shall discharge, cause to be discharged or place objects to be discharged along with any wastewater with an animal/vegetable FOG concentration in excess of 100 milligrams per liter (100 mg/l) as determined by the approved analytical test for total recoverable oil and grease derived from animal/vegetable sources listed in 40 CFR 136 or in concentrations and/or quantities which will harm the city treatment works as determined by the public works director or his appointed officer. 
(b)  Any laboratory analysis of wastewater effluent from FOG management equipment in excess of the city local limit for FOG will warrant immediate increased frequency of cleaning of FOG maintenance equipment. Should any FSE fail to meet the city limit for FOG within their wastewater effluent (100 mg/l) or be identified as the source for repeated grease buildup within the wastewater collection system, the city may require the FSE to replace any or all FOG management equipment as described in this section. If FOG management equipment is not currently in place, the city may require the installation of FOG management equipment to comply with FOG wastewater limits. 
(c)  All businesses, where FOG is cleaned from eating and food preparation utensils or equipment, shall be required to install an approved grease trap or interceptor to intercept any FOG before it enters the city's wastewater system. The FOG management equipment shall be continuously maintained in satisfactory and effective operation at the FSE's expense. The cleaning of the FOG equipment shall be conducted as detailed in this section. A record of all FOG management equipment maintenance activities, including cleaning records or hauled waste manifests, shall be maintained on the premises for a minimum of three years and shall be made available to the city upon request. 
(d)  All solid and liquid material from within the FOG interceptor shall be removed from the unit during pumping and cleaning. Decanting or discharging of removed wastewater and /or associated material back into a FOG interceptor is prohibited. The decanting process is not an acceptable cleaning procedure. All FOG interceptors shall be completely cleaned when 25 percent of the operating depth of the FOG interceptor is occupied by solids, either above the water level or below, or at a minimum of once every three months, whichever is more frequent. Some FSEs will need to clean their outdoor FOG interceptor monthly or bi-monthly, while others might need to clean their FOG interceptor every three months. If the contact person can provide data demonstrating that less frequent cleaning of the FOG interceptor will result in FOG or related settled material less than of 25 percent of the operating depth of the FOG interceptor, the city may allow a less frequent cleaning schedule, with cleaning frequency not to exceed every six months. 
(e)  A contact person shall be designated by each FSE or other business that requires a grease trap and shall serve as the responsible party for all compliance with this section. The contact person name and current information, including phone number and address shall be provided to the city water quality superintendent. Any changes in the information shall be promptly provided to the city by the FSE. 
(f)  The contact person shall be responsible for the proper removal of all material from within the FOG management equipment, which shall comply with all federal, state and city laws concerning transport and disposal of all material from the FOG management equipment. The contact person shall also ensure that the FOG interceptor is inspected when pumped to ensure that all internal fittings and fixtures are present and in good condition and functioning properly. All material inside an interceptor, including both solids and liquids, shall be removed during pumping. All solids are to be scraped from the walls and sides of the interceptor to maintain internal volume capacity. A maintenance log shall be maintained on the premises and shall include all copies of FOG disposal manifests detailing applicable dates, hauler name and means of disposal for the material. The maintenance log shall be made available to the city for inspection upon request. Interceptor cleaning and inspection records shall be maintained at the premises for a minimum of three years and shall be made available to the city for inspection upon request. 
(g)  Should the party responsible for adequate operation, maintenance, and/or cleaning of a FOG interceptor and all related plumbing fail to fulfill their maintenance obligation, the city may issue an NOV to have the FOG interceptor and related equipment cleaned and/or repaired at the expense of the property owner within 14 calendar days. Upon inaction of the responsible party to correct the NOV, the city shall schedule the required cleaning to be done at the expense of the owner. The city will present a bill containing all costs of the work, including all associated enforcement and administrative costs to the responsible party. If determined necessary by the water quality superintendent, the city may curtail water service to minimize blockages and potential sanitary sewer overflows from occurring and to protect the POTW and other residential and commercial entities tributary to the city's wastewater collection system. 
(h)  Any facility in violation of this section shall also be held liable for any other damages or costs created by the violation to the public sewer. 
(i)  A grease recovery unit may be used to reduce the volumetric size of the grease trap subject to approval by the city. The grease recovery unit design, specifications, and satisfactory investigation of the unit's record of performance in a similar installation shall be considered. 
(j)  Where surface runoff from a garbage compactor or grease dumpster is generated, a grease interceptor shall be installed between the compactor and the POTW. All stormwater shall be prevented from entering the wastewater collection system. 
(k)  A grease interceptor or automatic grease removal device shall be required to receive drainage from all fixtures and equipment with the potential for grease laden waste located in all food preparation areas. Fixtures and equipment shall include pot sinks, pre-rinse sinks; soup kettles or similar devices; work stations; floor drains or sinks to which kettles are drained; mop sinks; kitchen floor drains; culinary sinks; automatic hood wash units and dishwashers without pre-rinse sinks. Grease interceptors and automatic grease removal devices shall receive waste only from fixtures and equipment that allows fats, oils or grease to be discharged. Where the lack of space or other constraints prevent the installation or replacement of a grease interceptor, one or more grease interceptors shall be permitted to be installed on or above the floor and upstream of an existing grease interceptor. 
(l)  The size of the grease interceptor or automatic grease removal device will depend upon the sewage flow rate, the amount of grease discharged and the number of seats and/or type of food being prepared. Sizing shall be determined in accordance with ASME A112.14.3 Appendix A, ASME 112.14.4, CSA B481.3 or PDI G101. Hydro-mechanical grease interceptors or automatic grease removal devices equipped with manholes for access shall be equipped with a manhole for each chamber on the interceptor. Hydro-mechanical grease interceptors and automatic grease removal devices shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Where manufacturer's instructions are not provided, devices shall be installed in compliance with ASME A112.14.3, ASME 112.14.4, CSA B481.3 or PDI G101. Design for all grease interceptor sizing shall be completed by a licensed architect or engineer and submitted to the city and Christian County Health Department for approval. 
(m)  The city may require the FSE to install or replace FOG management equipment due to changes to menu and food preparation practices. Replacement equipment design and sizing shall meet all the requirements of this section. 
(n)  Any FSE qualified to use an indoor grease interceptor as approved under section (i) above must also utilize an inline solids trap upstream of the interceptor unit. This solids trap should be cleaned daily, at a minimum, or more often if wastewater flow is impeded in any way by solids collected within the unit. Solids removed from the solids trap are to be disposed of in the trash where other solids waste from the FSE is disposed. The solids may require bagging to prevent contact with humans or animals and to prevent contact with insects that may spread disease or endanger human health. 
(o)  A sampling manhole shall be installed for all required interceptors in accordance with city technical specifications standard details to monitor the entire building or individual tenant space. 
(p)  Where a food service establishment can document, to the satisfaction of the city's building code official, water quality superintendent and county health department, that all food preparation occurs off premises, or in such establishments as a church, senior center, or civic club where food preparation on-site does not exceed but once per month, the applicant's engineer shall design and the establishment shall install a grease trap in conformance with the city's adopted international plumbing code. At no time shall a grease trap be installed with less than 70-pound capacity. All establishments required to install a grease trap shall install an exterior sampling pit in conformance with the city's general conditions, and technical specifications. 
(q)  The city, at any time, may take grab samples and conduct laboratory analysis of the wastewater discharged from any FOG management equipment to ensure compliance with city limits for FOG in wastewater (100 mg/l). City staff may visually inspect wastewater within the sampling manhole to determine the need for increased frequency of cleaning of FOG management equipment. Any buildup of grease within the sampling manhole piping shall indicate the need for an increase in cleaning frequency, regardless of any past operational procedures. Provided that authorized city personnel find through testing at the sampling manhole or by other means that food preparations or discharge of oils and grease at the establishment is in greater quantities than that which was documented at the time of its approval, the owner/operator of the establishment shall receive an NOV providing not more than 60 days to bring the property's use into conformance with the original approval or install a grease trap that is in conformance with the design and sizing as described in (j) above. If the owner/operator fails to bring the property into conformance within the notice of violation, the city may penalize such establishment by initiating a stop work order and curtail water service until such time as the establishment is brought into conformance with this article. 
(r)  More than one business may connect to a common FOG interceptor such as a multi-tenant building with a single sewer service, provided the grease trap sizing criteria for the common service area does not exceed the capacity of the FOG interceptor in use or planned for use as required elsewhere in this section. Each FOG generator shall be listed on a permit issued to each user of the unit. Again, failure to maintain local FOG limits will require the installation of additional FOG management equipment to maintain rule compliance as set forth in this section. 
(s)  Prior to permitting, FOG interceptors serving more than one FSE and/or business must provide documentation of a signed and legal maintenance agreement between responsible parties, such as but not limited to: 
(1)  POAProperty owners' associations. 
(2)  CAMCommon area maintenance. 
(3)  Agreement between owner/operator showing physical responsibility for operation, maintenance, and cleaning of the FOG interceptor and all related piping and equipment. 
(t)  Chemical and /or biological additives that cause or could cause fats, oils and/or grease fractions to be released from the FOG management equipment are not permitted without the written approval of the city department of public works. The city does not endorse chemical or biological treatment, as these materials could potentially cause accumulated FOG material to liquefy only to coagulate elsewhere in the wastewater collection system. 
(u)  Renderable or recyclable FOG shall not be disposed into any sewer, septic tank or FOG interceptor. All renderable FOG shall be stored in a separate, covered, leak-proof container, stored out of the reach of vermin and collected by an approved waste hauler. 
(v)  Small quantities of FOG scraped or removed from pots, pans, dishes, grills and utensils shall be discarded into a trash receptacle for proper and legal solid waste disposal. All applicable federal, state, and city solid waste laws, rules and regulations shall apply to the disposal of solid waste containing FOG contaminated material. 
(Prior Code, § 17-60; Ord. No. 1747, § 17-60, 8-8-2012; Ord. No. 1928, 1-17-2017; Ord. No. 1930, 2-20-2017)  
Sec. 22-220. - Preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities. 
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.

Sec. 22-221. - Control manholes, meters and other appurtenances. 
When required by the city sewer inspector, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city sewer inspector. The manhole shall be installed by the owner, at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(Prior Code, § 17-62; Ord. No. 1747, § 17-62, 8-8-2012)  
Sec. 22-222. - Measurements, tests and analyses. 
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)

Sec. 22-228. - Pretreatment discharge requirements. 
Users requiring the use of pretreatment prior to discharge to the city's collection system shall be subject to the conditions, terms, and limitations as established in section 22-243 in addition to the following: 
(1)  The city may require any user that, in their opinion, discharges nondomestic effluent thereby threatening the integrity of the city's treatment works, to provide sampling, analysis and/or a professional evaluation of current or predicted discharge characteristics. The sampling, analysis, and estimation of present and future discharge, shall be provided and supervised by qualified personnel and evaluated by methods acceptable to the city and in accordance with state and federal regulations. Analysis may require, but is not limited to the measurement of suspended solids and BOD concentrations. In addition, pH levels and flow rates shall be measured continuously with proper monitoring and recording equipment. Information acquired from monitoring equipment and tests shall be well documented, preserved, and made available to the city for their convenient review. The city may use information obtained through sampling and analysis as a basis to impose and raise surcharge fees and future sampling/analysis requirements. Further, the results of analysis may be used as justification to restrict or deny discharge to the city and to establish responsibility and assess fines for any damage sustained by the city's treatment works. A set of plans and specifications indicating sampling equipment locations and sampling methods shall be submitted to the city for review and consideration. Required sampling equipment shall consist of, as a minimum, a refrigerated sampler. The city must approve all sampling sites, equipment and procedures prior to allowing the discharge of effluent. 
(2)  Safety and tampering prevention methods shall be outlined on plans and specifications and shall meet all city, state and federal guidelines. The city reserves the right to require additional safety and security measures if it concludes such measures are necessary to protect the welfare of their collection system and its components. The maintenance and operation of all equipment related to the discharge, storage and monitoring of waste shall be performed by qualified personnel and shall be done under the direct supervision of an experienced technician. To protect against tampering or the use, intentional or accidental, by untrained or unqualified personnel, all valves, manholes, and other items which allow for the discharge of effluent, relate to the operation of the pretreatment system, or provide access to sampling, recording and other monitoring equipment shall be locked and sufficiently secured at all times. Access to the above equipment shall be locked and sufficiently secured at all times. Access to the abovementioned items shall be allowed only to appropriately trained personnel and selected city employees. The city shall be supplied with means to access monitoring, recording and sampling equipment and shall be allowed the opportunity to inspect and observe operation of the treatment facility and all safety and security devices at their discretion. Monitoring, sampling and other related equipment shall be supplied by the user and will be accompanied by the appropriate equipment to allow for the adjustment of flow and pH levels and for the complete and immediate shut off of discharge should levels fail to meet the city's requirements as previously established. In addition, a secondary power source independent of other power sources shall be supplied by the user and shall be capable of maintaining treatment operations and monitoring equipment, which occur prior to the discharge of effluent. The secondary power source shall be maintained in operational condition and will be immediately available in the event of any planned or unplanned disruption of the primary power source. 
(3)  Users, which have waste that is considered high strength, when compared to the term defined in section 22-102, "normal domestic wastewater," shall have all components of their waste assessed and approved by the city. Any waste not approved by the city shall be separated entirely from the waste approved for discharge. The user shall provide necessary safety features which allow for the isolated containment of the unapproved waste. Disposal and handling of the unapproved waste shall be done only by appropriately qualified personnel. The waste not approved for discharge shall be stored and handled in such a manner that mishandling, spill or accidental release of the waste will not reenter the collection system either through the floor drains, sinks or other courses. Additionally, the city may also require a city representative to be present to observe and/or direct the disposal, discharge or collection of the users waste and effluent, which does not have the approval of the city. Dates and times at which the city is to be present shall be arranged and approved by the city. Reasonable reimbursement may be required to the city from the user to cover the expense associated with having city personnel on site. The discharge of waste requiring the city's supervision, without an appropriate city representative present, may result in the discontinuation of service by the city and reimbursement by the user to the city for fines and damages to the city's treatment works. 
(4)  Any user discharging high strength wastewater in a volume and/or strength found to be acceptable to the city shall be subject to payment of a surcharge as indicated in section 22-243. Further, any user, under the inspection of the city and qualified individuals, which is found to be directly responsible for damage to the city's treatment works resulting in the improper discharge of waste shall be responsible in full for the financial payment of any ensuing fines and damages, or other compensations as assessed by city, county, state and/or other federal agencies. Payment of fines or other compensation shall be in an amount and schedule as set by qualified city personnel and approved by the city council. At the city's discretion, the user may be denied services by the city indefinitely and without prior notification should the user be found responsible for damage to the treatment system.

Sec. 101-69. - Membership and vacancies. 
(a)  The commission shall consist of the city engineer as an ex officio member, plus nine citizens of the city at large to be known as citizen members. Citizen members of the commission shall be appointed by the mayor with the approval of the city council, for a term of four years and until their successors are appointed and qualified; two citizen members shall be appointed in November of each year for four-year terms.

Such contacts include meetings with project proponents, residents, property owners, and citizens separate from commission meetings; communication between commission members outside the meeting forum; or telephone calls or letters which attempt to influence a commissioner's opinion on a matter which will be subject to the commissioner's vote. The planning commissioners shall indicate to the person contacting them that such contact is inappropriate and all testimony needs to be offered at the hearing to ensure a fair hearing for all parties. Commissioners should discourage such contacts and should avoid expressing any opinion as to the merits of the case. When ex parte contact occurs, the planning commissioner is responsible for notifying the development department director and for conveying the substance of the communication at the next commission meeting at which the matter discussed is under consideration.

ARTICLE III. - PERMITS AND PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL 
 
Sec. 101-127. - Permits required. 
(a)  Subject to section 113-3, the use made of property may not be substantially changed (see section 117-97), substantial clearing, grading, or excavation may not be commenced, and buildings or other substantial structures may not be constructed, erected, moved, or substantially altered except in accordance with and pursuant to one of the following permits: 
(1)  An approved use permit issued by the city planner. 
(2)  A special-use permit issued by the city council. 
(3)  A preliminary plat approval issued by the city council. 
(4)  A sign permit issued by the city planner. 
(b)  Approved use permits, special-use permits, preliminary plat approvals and sign permits are issued under this subpart only when a review of the application submitted, including the plans contained therein, indicates that the development will comply with the provisions of this subpart if completed as proposed. Such plans and applications as are finally approved are incorporated into any permit issued, and except as otherwise provided in section 101-147, all development shall occur strictly in accordance with such approved plans and applications. 
(c)  Physical improvements to land to be subdivided may not be commenced except in accordance with a preliminary plat approval issued by the city council for major subdivisions, or after final plat approval by the planning and zoning commission for minor subdivisions. 
(d)  An approved use permit, preliminary plat approval, special-use permit, or sign permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant (except that applications submitted by an agent shall be issued in the name of the principal); shall identify the property involved and the proposed use; shall incorporate by reference the plans submitted; and shall contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing authority. All such permits issued with respect to tracts of land in excess of one-acre (except sign permits and approved use permits for single-family and two-family residential uses) shall be recorded in the county registry after execution by the record owner as provided in section 101-146. 
(Prior Code, § 23-60)  
Sec. 101-128. - No occupancy, use, or sale of lots until requirements fulfilled. 
Issuance of a preliminary plat approval, special-use, or approved use permit authorizes the recipient to commence the activity resulting in a change in land use or (subject to obtaining a building permit) to commence work designed to construct, erect, move, or substantially alter buildings or other substantial structures or to make necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except as provided in sections 101-134, 101-144, and 101-145, the intended use may not be commenced; no building may be occupied; and in the case of subdivisions, no lots may be sold until all of the requirements of this subpart and all additional requirements imposed pursuant to the issuance of a preliminary plat approval or special-use permit have been in compliance. 
(Prior Code, § 23-61)  
Sec. 101-129. - Who may submit permit applications. 
(a)  Applications for approved use, special-use, preliminary plat, or sign permits or minor subdivision plat approval will be accepted only from persons having legal authority to take action in accordance with the permit or the minor subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration, in general this means that applications should be made by the owners or lessees of property, or their agents, or persons who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon their ability to acquire the necessary permits under this subpart, or the agents of such persons (who may make application in the name of such owners, lessees, or contract vendors). 
(b)  The city planner may require an applicant to submit evidence of his authority to submit the application in accordance with subsection (a) of this section whenever there appears to be a reasonable basis for questioning this authority. 
(Prior Code, § 23-62)  
Sec. 101-130. - Applications to be complete. 
(a)  All applications for approved use, special-use, preliminary plat, or sign permits must be complete before the permit-issuing authority is required to consider the application. 
(b)  Subject to subsection (c) of this section, an application is complete when it contains all of the information that is necessary for the permit-issuing authority to decide whether or not the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this subpart. 
(c)  In this subpart, detailed or technical design requirements and construction specifications relating to various types of improvements (streets, sidewalks, etc.) are set forth in the technical specifications book. It is not necessary that the application contain the type of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to determine compliance with appendix A at the end of this article, so long as the plans provide sufficient information to allow the permit-issuing authority to evaluate the application in the light of the substantive requirements set forth in this text of this subpart. 
(d)  However, whenever this subpart requires a certain element of a development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed requirements set forth in appendix A at the end of this article, then no construction work on such element may be commenced until detailed construction drawings have been submitted to and approved by the city planner. 
(e)  Failure to observe this requirement may result in permit revocation, denial of final subdivision plat approval, or other penalty as provided in article VI. 
(f)  The presumption established by this subpart is that all of the information set forth in appendix A at the end of this article is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. However, it is recognized that each development is unique, and therefore the permit-issuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the particular case. For applications submitted to the city council, the applicant may rely in the first instance on the recommendations of the city planner as to whether more or less information than that set forth in appendix A at the end of this article should be submitted. 
(g)  The city planner shall make every effort to develop application forms, instructional sheets, checklists, or other techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted. In cases where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the city planner to determine compliance with this subpart, such as applications for approved use permits to construct single-family or two-family houses, or applications for sign permits, the city planner shall develop standard forms that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required information. 
(Prior Code, § 23-63)  
Sec. 101-131. - Staff consultation before formal application. 
(a)  To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart, preapplication consultation between the developer and the planning staff is encouraged or required as provided in this section. 
(b)  Before submitting an application for a preliminary plat approval authorizing a development that consists of or contains a major subdivision, the developer shall submit to the city planner a sketch plan of such subdivision, drawn approximately to scale (one inch equals 100 feet). The sketch plan shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the developer; 
(2)  The proposed name and location of the subdivision; 
(3)  The approximate total acreage of the proposed subdivision; 
(4)  The tentative street and lot arrangement; 
(5)  Topographic lines; and 
(6)  Any other information which the developer believes necessary to obtain the informal opinion of the planning staff as to the proposed subdivision's compliance with the requirements of this subpart. 
(c)  The city planner shall meet with the developer as soon as conveniently possible to review the sketch plan. 
(d)  Before submitting an application for any other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the planning staff concerning the application of this subpart to the proposed development. 
(Prior Code, § 23-64)  
Sec. 101-132. - Staff consultation after application submitted. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a formal application for an approved use permit, a special-use permit, or a preliminary plat approval, or minor plat approval, the city planner shall review the application and confer with the applicant to ensure that he understands the planning staff's interpretation of the applicable requirements of this subpart, that he has submitted all of the information that he intends to submit, and that the application represents precisely and completely what he proposes to do. 
(b)  If the application is for a special-use permit or preliminary plat approval, the city planner shall place the application on the agenda of the planning and zoning commission when the applicant indicates that the application is as complete as he intends to make it. However, as provided in sections 101-139 and 101-140, if the city planner believes that the application is incomplete, he shall recommend to the planning and zoning commission that the application be denied on that basis. 
(Prior Code, § 23-65)  
Sec. 101-133. - Approved use permits. 
(a)  A completed application form for an approved use permit shall be submitted to the city planner by filing a copy of the application with the city planner in the development department. 
(b)  The city planner shall issue the approved use permit unless he finds, after reviewing the application and consulting with the applicant as provided in section 101-132, that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within his jurisdiction according to the table of approved uses; 
(2)  The application is incomplete; or 
(3)  If not completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this subpart (not including those requirements concerning which a variance has been granted or those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in article VII, nonconforming situations). 
(Prior Code, § 23-66)  
Sec. 101-134. - Authorizing use or occupancy before completion of development under approved use permit. 
In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoning-permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the zoning-permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this subpart prior to commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the city planner may authorize the commencement of the intended use of the occupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of this subpart are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a performance bond to ensure that all of the requirements of this subpart will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed 12 months) determined by the city planner. 
(Prior Code, § 23-67)  
Sec. 101-135. - Application for special-use permits and preliminary plat approvals. 
(a)  An application for a special-use permit shall be submitted to the city council with a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission by filing a copy of the application with the city planner in the development department. 
(b)  An application for a preliminary plat approval shall be submitted to the city council with a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission by filing a copy of the application with the city planner in the development department. 
(c)  Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the city council shall issue the requested permit unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within his jurisdiction according to the table of approved uses; 
(2)  The application is incomplete; or 
(3)  If not completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this subpart (not including those requirements concerning which a variance has been granted or those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in article VII, nonconforming situations). 
(d)  Even if the city council finds that the application complies with all other provisions of this subpart, it may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon information submitted at the hearing, that completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not: 
(1)  Will endanger the public health and safety; 
(2)  Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; 
(3)  Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located; or 
(4)  Will not be in general conformity with the land-use plan, thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the city council. 
(Prior Code, § 23-68)  
Sec. 101-136. - Special-use permits; conditions for approval. 
(a)  An application for a special-use permit shall be submitted to the city council with a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, by way of filing a copy of the application with the city planner in the development department. 
(b)  Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the city council shall issue the requested permit unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within the jurisdiction of the city according to the table of approved uses; 
(2)  The application is incomplete; or 
(3)  If the development is not completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this subpart (not including those requirements concerning which a variance has been granted or those not required of the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in article VII, nonconforming situations). 
(c)  In review of an application, the city council, following a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, may approve or conditionally approve the request pursuant to the following findings: 
(1)  The proposed use is consistent with the city comprehensive plan, this subpart and the intended uses of the zoning district as established in chapter 117, article II. 
(2)  The proposed use, together with the applicable conditions, will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the city. 
(3)  The proposed use is properly located relative to the community as a whole and to land uses and transportation and service facilities in the vicinity. 
(4)  The size and shape of the subject property is adequate to provide features needed to ensure reasonable compatibility with the land uses normally permitted in the surrounding area. Features may include, but are not limited to yards, open spaces, walls and fences, parking, loading, landscaping, and such features as may be required by this subpart or conditionally by the city council. 
(5)  Public utilities and facilities are, or will be, adequate to serve the proposed use. This included paved streets, of adequate width, for the quantity and type of traffic it will generate. 
(6)  The proposed use will not adversely affect nearby properties or their permitted uses. 
(d)  Even if the city council finds that the application complies with all other provisions of this subpart, it may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon information submitted at the hearing, that completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not: 
(1)  Will endanger the public health and safety; 
(2)  Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; 
(3)  Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is located; or 
(4)  Will not be in general conformity with the land use plan, thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the city council.

(a)  The burden of presenting a complete application (as described in section 101-130) to the planning and zoning commission and the city council shall be upon the applicant. However, unless the planning and zoning commission informs the applicant at the hearing in what way the application is incomplete and offers the applicant an opportunity to complete the application (either at that meeting or at a continuation hearing), the application shall be presumed to be complete. 
(b)  Once a completed application has been submitted, the burden of presenting sufficient evidence, to the planning and zoning commission and to the city council, to lead it to conclude that the application should be denied for any reasons stated in section 101-135(c)(1), (3) or (d), shall be upon the party or parties urging this position, unless the information presented by the applicant in his application and at the public hearing is sufficient to justify a reasonable conclusion that a reason exists to so deny the application. 
(c)  The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with the requirements of this subpart remains at all times on the applicant. The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the application should be turned down for any of the reasons set forth in section 101-135(d) rests on the party or parties urging that the requested permit should be denied. 
(Prior Code, § 23-69)  
Sec. 101-138. - Recommendations on special-use permit applications. 
(a)  When presented to the planning and zoning commission at the hearing, the application for a special-use permit shall be accompanied by a report with the planning staff's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with section 101-130 (applications to be complete) and the other requirements of this subpart, as well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the city council. 
(b)  If the staff proposed a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with section 101-130 or any other requirement of this subpart, it shall identify the requirements in question, and specifically state supporting reasons for those proposed findings or conclusions. 
(c)  The city council may, by general rule applicable to all cases, refer applications back to the planning and zoning commission to obtain further recommendations. 
(Prior Code, § 23-70; Ord. No. 1733, 4-16-2012)  
Sec. 101-139. - Recommendations on preliminary plat approval applications. 
(a)  Before being presented to the city council, an application for a preliminary plat approval shall be referred to the planning and zoning commission for action in accordance with this section. The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on a preliminary plat approval application pursuant to standard agenda procedures. In addition, the city council shall hold a public hearing. 
(b)  When presented to the planning and zoning commission, the application shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the planning staff's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with section 101-131 and other requirements in this subpart, as well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the city council. If the planning staff report proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with section 101-131 or any other requirement in this subpart, it shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions. 
(c)  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the application and the attached staff report in a timely fashion, and may, in its discretion, hear from the applicant or member of the public. Notice to the adjoining property owners is provided for in section 101-298. 
(d)  After reviewing the application, the planning and zoning commission shall report to the city council whether it concurs in whole or in part with the staff's proposed findings and conditions, and, to the extent there are differences, the planning commission shall propose its own recommendations and the reasons therefor. 
(Prior Code, § 23-71)  
Sec. 101-140. - City council action on preliminary plat approvals. 
In considering whether to approve an application for a preliminary plat approval, the city council shall proceed according to the following format: 
(1)  The city council shall consider whether the application is complete. If no member moves that the application be found incomplete (specifying either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete) then this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the city council that the application is complete. 
(2)  The city council shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of this subpart. If a motion to this effect passes, the city council need not make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a motion fails or is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with one or more of the requirements the application fails to meet. Separate votes may be taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the city council to be unsatisfied through this process. 
(3)  If the city council concludes that the application fails to comply with one or more requirements of this subpart, the application shall be denied. If the city council concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion to deny the application for one or more reasons set forth in section 101-135(d). Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. 
(Prior Code, § 23-72)  
Sec. 101-141. - City council action on special-use permits. 
In considering whether to approve an application for a special-use permit, the city council shall proceed in the same manner as when considering preliminary plat approval applications (section 101-140). 
(1)  The city council shall consider whether the application is complete. If the city council concludes that the application is incomplete, and the applicant refuses to provide the additional requested information, the application shall be denied. A motion to this effect shall specify either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete. If a motion to this effect is not made and concurred, this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the city council that the application is complete. 
(2)  The city council shall consider whether the application complies with all applicable requirements of this subpart. If a motion to this effect passes, then the city council need not make further findings concerning such requirements. If the motion fails to receive the necessary vote, or is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with one or more requirements of this subpart. Such a motion shall specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. A separate vote may be taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the city council to be unsatisfied through this process. As provided in section 101-135(d), if the city council concludes that the application fails to meet one or more of the requirements of this subpart, the application shall be denied. 
(3)  If the city council concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion to deny the application for one or more of the reasons set forth in section 101-135 and 101-142. Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. 
(Prior Code, § 23-73; Ord. No. 1733, 4-16-2012)  
Sec. 101-142. - Additional requirements on special-use permit applications. 
(a)  The city council may apply reasonable conditions of approval to assure compliance with the applicable regulations and standards, including those recommended by city staff. The following provides guidelines for additional conditions of approval: 
(1)  Conformity with site plan, architectural drawings, or statements submitted in support of the application, or as modified during the review process to protect the public health, safety and general welfare, and to secure the objectives of this subpart and comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Special buffer yards, screening and landscaping as needed to offset impacts to surrounding properties. 
(3)  Surfacing or parking areas for both public and non-public vehicular accommodations. 
(4)  Street dedications and improvements, including the provision for service roads or alleys, when practical. 
(5)  Dedications of utility easements, sites for public uses, and preservation of open space. 
(6)  Regulating points of vehicular ingress and egress. 
(7)  Regulations of signs. 
(8)  Landscaping and its maintenance. 
(9)  Maintenance of the grounds. 
(10)  Control of noise, vibration, odors, glare and other potentially dangerous or objectionable elements. 
(11)  Limits on time for the conduct of certain activities. 
(12)  Time period within which the proposed use shall be developed. 
(13)  Conditions addressing the orderly and efficient development of the city and consistency with the interest and purposes set forth in this subpart and comprehensive plan. 
(b)  The city council may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific requirements set forth in this subpart unless the development in question presents extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements. 
(c)  Without limiting the foregoing, the city council may attach a condition to a permit limiting the permit to a specified duration of operations. 
(d)  All additional conditions or requirements shall be entered on the permit. 
(e)  All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this section are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this subpart. 
(f)  A vote may be taken regarding application conditions or requirements, before consideration as to whether the permit should be approved or denied, for any of the reasons set forth in section 101-135. 
(Ord. No. 1733, § 23-73.1, 4-16-2012)  
Sec. 101-143. - Additional requirements on special-use and preliminary plat approvals. 
(a)  Subject to subsection (b) of this section, in granting a special-use or preliminary plat approval, the city council may attach to the permit such reasonable requirements in addition to those specified in this subpart to ensure that the development in its proposed location: 
(1)  Will not endanger the public health or safety; 
(2)  Will not injure the value of adjoining property or abutting property; 
(3)  Will be in harmony with the area in which it is located; and 
(4)  Will be in conformity with the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the city council. 
(b)  The city council may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific requirements set forth in this subpart unless the development in question presents extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements. 
(c)  Without limiting the foregoing, the city council may attach a condition to a permit limiting the permit to a specified duration. 
(d)  All additional conditions or requirements shall be entered on the permit. 
(e)  All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this section are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this subpart. 
(f)  A vote may be taken on application conditions or requirements before consideration of whether the permit should be denied for any of the reasons set forth in section 101-135. 
(Prior Code, § 23-74)  
Sec. 101-144. - Authorizing use, occupancy, or sale before completion of development under special-use or preliminary plat approvals. 
(a)  In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the special-use or preliminary plat approval recipient (exclusive of financial hardship) it would be unreasonable to require the permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this subpart before commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings or selling lots in a subdivision, the city council may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings or the sale of subdivision lots (insofar as the requirements of this subpart are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a performance bond to the city council to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed 12 months). 
(b)  When the city council imposes additional requirements upon the permit recipient in accordance with section 101-143 or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install amenities beyond those required by this subpart, the city council may authorize the permittee to commence the intended use of the property or to occupy any building or to sell any subdivision lots before the additional requirements are fulfilled or the amenities installed if it specifies a date by which or a schedule according to which such requirements must be met or each amenity installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the result of any one or more of the following: 
(1)  A performance bond is furnished to the city council; 
(2)  A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on the permit, thereby ensuring that the permit recipient's compliance will be reviewed when application for renewal is made; 
(3)  The nature of the requirements or amenities is such that sufficient assurance of compliance is given by section 101-238 (penalties and remedies for violations) and section 101-239 (permit revocation). 
(c)  With respect to subdivisions in which the developer is selling only undeveloped lots, the city council may authorize final plat approval and the sale of lots before all the requirements of this subpart are fulfilled if the subdivider provides an escrow secured with cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited with the city or a performance bond to the city council to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within not more than 12 months after final plat approval. 
(Prior Code, § 23-75)  
Sec. 101-145. - Completing developments in phases. 
(a)  If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with this section, then, subject to subsection (c) of this section, the provisions of section 101-128 (no occupancy, use, or sale of lots until requirements fulfilled) and section 101-144 (exceptions to section 101-128) shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development. 
(b)  As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this subpart that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage. 
(c)  If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of his application for development approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of one or more phases or stages of the entire development. 
(d)  Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied, and no subdivision lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the permit, provided that: 
(1)  If the improvement is one required by this subpart then the developer may utilize the provisions of section 101-144(a) or (c). 
(2)  If the improvement is an amenity not required by this subpart or is provided in response to a condition imposed by the city council, then the developer may utilize the provisions of section 101-144(b). 
(Prior Code, § 23-76)  
Sec. 101-146. - Expiration of permits. 
(a)  Approved use, special-use, preliminary plat, and sign permits shall expire automatically if, within one year after the issuance of such permits the use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work is necessary before commencement of such use. 
(b)  If, after some physical alteration to land or structure begins to take place, such work is discontinued for a period of one year, then the permit authorizing such work shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of section 101-147. 
(c)  The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six months the date when a permit would otherwise expire pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section if it concludes that: 
(1)  The permit has not yet expired; 
(2)  The permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith; and 
(3)  Conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. 
Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six months upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of article VII (nonconforming situations), this section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this section becomes effective. 
(Prior Code, § 23-77)  
Sec. 101-147. - Effect of permit on successors and assigns. 
(a)  Approved use, special-use, preliminary plat, and sign permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then: 
(1)  No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and 
(2)  The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the property had actual or record notice (as provided in subsection (b) of this section) of the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their interest. 
(b)  Whenever an approved, special-use, or preliminary plat permit is issued to authorize development (other than single-family or two-family residences) on a tract of land in excess of one acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the property signs a written acknowledgment that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the county registry and indexed under the record owner's name as grantor. 
(Prior Code, § 23-78)  
Sec. 101-148. - Amendments to and modifications of permits. 
(a)  Insignificant deviations from the permit (including approved plans) issued by the city council or the city planner are permissible, and the city planner may authorize such insignificant deviations. A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. 
(b)  Minor design modifications or changes in permits (including approved plans) are permissible with the approval of the city council. Such permission may be obtained without a formal application, public hearing, or payment of any additional fee. For purposes of this section, minor design modifications or changes are those that have no substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. 
(c)  All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed as new applications. If such requests are required to be acted upon by the city council or board of adjustment, new conditions may be imposed in accordance with section 101-143, but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing his request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit. 
(d)  The administrator shall determine whether amendments to and modifications of permits fall within the categories set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section. 
(e)  A developer requesting approval of changes shall submit a written request for such approval to the city planner, and that request shall identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be given in writing. 
(Prior Code, § 23-79)  
Sec. 101-149. - Reconsideration of city council or board of adjustment action. 
(a)  Whenever the city council disapproves a conditional-use or special-use permit application or the board of adjustment disapproves an application for a variance, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application, such action may not be reconsidered by the respective board at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that: 
(1)  Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have substantially changed; or 
(2)  New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented at a previous hearing. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed with the city planner within the time period for an appeal to superior court (see section 101-240). However, such a request does not extend the period within which an appeal must be taken. 
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the city council or board of adjustment may at any time consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in some substantial way from the one previously considered. 
(Prior Code, § 23-80)  
Sec. 101-150. - Applications to be processed expeditiously. 
Recognizing that inordinate delays in acting upon appeals or applications may impose unnecessary costs on the appellant or applicant, the city shall make every reasonable effort to process appeals and permit applications as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to ensure that all development conforms to the requirements of this subpart. 
(Prior Code, § 23-81)  
Sec. 101-151. - Maintenance of common areas, improvements, and facilities. 
The recipient of any approved use, special-use, preliminary plat, or sign permit, or his successor, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas, improvements, or facilities required by this subpart or any permit issued in accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements, or facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by the appropriate public authority. As illustrations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this means that private roads and parking areas, water and sewer lines, and recreational facilities must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended, and required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping, or shading must be replaced if they die or are destroyed. 
(Prior Code, § 23-82)  
Sec. 101-152. - Application requirements. 
(a)  As provided in section 101-130, it is recognized that the charts in this section outline the city's application packages and required submittal requirements. From this information the city shall determine whether the development proposal would comply with all of the requirements of this subpart. The permit issuing authority may require more information or accept less information according to the particular proposal. 
(b)  Any submittal that does not meet the requirements as stated in this section shall constitute an incomplete application and shall be returned to the applicant. 
(c)  The only opportunity for waiver or adjustment of any of these requirements is by the planning and development manager, following a preapplication conference. 
(d)  All plans for the same project shall be submitted at the same scale. Projects that require several applications shall have all plans submitted at the same scale, with a separate plan for each application. 
(e)  Plans shall, where possible, include information on as few sheets as possible while still presenting information in a clear and concise manner. The title of the project shall be prominently placed in the upper right quadrant of the plan. All sheets shall be consecutively numbered. 
(f)  The application package and plan submittal requirements contained in this section are the minimum amount of information that must be submitted in order for the review process to begin. The applicant may need to submit additional information in order to demonstrate satisfaction of review criteria. All exhibits and information used to demonstrate satisfaction of review criteria must be made part of the plan documents and will be kept on file with the city. 
(g)  In circumstances where an application is either postponed or tabled by the planning and zoning commission or the city council for a period greater than four months, the applicant must re-notify all property owners within 185 feet, by certified mail, of the new hearing date in conformance with the notification requirements of this section.

Sec. 101-173. - Appeals. 
(a)  An appeal from any final order or decision of the city planner may be taken to the board of adjustment by any person aggrieved. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board. An appeal is taken by filing with the city planner and the board of adjustment a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed with the city planner and the board of adjustment when delivered to the development department, and the date and time of the filing shall be entered on the notice by the planning staff. 
(b)  An appeal must be heard within a reasonable time after the date of the decision or order appealed from. 
(c)  Whenever an appeal is filed, the city planner shall transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record relating to the action appealed from. 
(d)  An appeal stays all actions by the city planner seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the city planner certifies to the board of adjustment that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the board of adjustment or a court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after notice to the city planner. 
(e)  The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the board of adjustment shall have powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
(Prior Code, § 23-101)  
Sec. 101-174. - Variances. 
(a)  An application for a variance shall be submitted to the board of adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the city planner in the development department. Applications shall be handled in the same manner as applications for special-use permits in conformity with the provisions of sections 101-129, 101-130, and 101-131. 
(b)  A variance may be granted by the board of adjustment if it concludes that strict enforcement of this subpart would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of this subpart will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. It may reach these conclusions if it finds that: 
(1)  If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this subpart, he can make no reasonable use of his property; 
(2)  The hardship of which the applicant complains is one suffered by the applicant rather than by neighbors or the general public; 
(3)  The hardship relates to the applicant's land, rather than personal circumstances; 
(4)  The hardship is unique, or nearly so, rather than personal circumstances; 
(5)  The hardship is not the result of the applicant's own actions; and 
(6)  The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming situation in violation of article VII of this chapter, nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use of land. 
(c)  In granting variances, the board of adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. 
(d)  A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. 
(e)  The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the approved use permit or the approved use permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any applicable requirement of this subpart. 
(Prior Code, § 23-102)  
Sec. 101-175. - Interpretations; boundaries of city. 
(a)  The board of adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and to pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and similar questions. If such questions arise in the context of an appeal from a decision of the city planner, they shall be handled as provided in section 101-173. 
(b)  An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the board of adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the city planner in the development department. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the board of adjustment to make the necessary interpretation. 
(c)  Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of alleys, streets, highways, streams, or railroads shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines or city limits shall be construed as following those lot lines or limits. 
(d)  Interpretations of the location of floodway and floodplain boundary lines may be made by the city planner. 
(Prior Code, § 23-103)  
Sec. 101-176. - Requests to be heard expeditiously. 
(a)  When an appeal is taken to the board of adjustment in accordance with section 101-173, the city planner shall have the initial burden of presenting to the board of adjustment sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion. 
(b)  The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the board of adjustment to reach the conclusions set forth in section 101-174, as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance. 
(Prior Code, § 23-104)  
Sec. 101-177. - Board of adjustment action on appeals and variances. 
(a)  With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or findings of facts that support the motion. If a motion to reverse or modify is not made or fails to receive the four-fifths vote necessary for adoption (see section 101-97), then a motion to uphold the decision appealed from shall be in order. This motion is adopted as the board of adjustment's decision if supported by more than one-fifth of the board's membership (excluding vacant seats). 
(b)  A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or more of the six criteria set forth in section 101-174 are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the board of adjustment's decision if supported by more than one-fifth of the board's membership (excluding vacant seats).

(b)  All persons who intend to present evidence to the permit-issuing board, rather than arguments only, shall be sworn. 
(c)  All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested permit or appeal (crucial findings) shall be based upon reliable evidence. Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of law) shall be preferred whenever reasonably available, but in no case may crucial findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is not reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to the particularly reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously disputed. 
(Prior Code, § 23-113)  
Sec. 101-211. - Modification of application at hearing. 
(a)  In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the city council, the applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and specifications submitted. 
(b)  Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the city council cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before it, the board may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the development department. 
(Prior Code, § 23-114)  
Sec. 101-212. - Record. 
(a)  Accurate minutes shall be kept of all such proceedings, but a transcript need not be made. 
(b)  Whenever practicable, all documentary evidence presented at a hearing as well as all other types of physical evidence shall be made a part of the record of the proceedings and shall be kept by the city for at least two years.

Sec. 101-236. - Persons liable. 
The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any situation that is contrary to the requirements of this subpart may be held responsible for the violation and suffer the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided.

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this subpart or pose a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the city planner may seek enforcement without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties or remedies authorized in section 101-238. 
(Prior Code, § 23-122)

Sec. 101-239. - Permit revocation. 
(a)  An approved use, sign, special-use, or preliminary plat approval may be revoked by the permit-issuing authority (in accordance with the provisions of this section) if the permit recipient fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance with the plans submitted, the requirements of this subpart, or any additional requirements lawfully imposed by the city council.

ARTICLE VII. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 
 
Sec. 101-259. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Dimensional nonconformity means a nonconforming situation that occurs when the height, size, or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located. 
Effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived , means, whenever this article refers to the effective date of this subpart, the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this subpart if the amendment, rather than this subpart as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation. 
Expenditure means a sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation. The term "expenditure" also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures, as well as any other substantial changes in position. 
Nonconforming lot means a lot existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived (and not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this subpart) that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located. 
Nonconforming project means any structure, development, or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived, this subpart and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned. 
Nonconforming sign means a sign (see section 113-2) that on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived does not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this subpart, particularly chapter 113, signs. 
Nonconforming situation means a situation that occurs when, on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived, an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and setback requirements) is not used for purposes made unlawful by this subpart. Nonconforming signs shall not be regarded as nonconforming situations for purposes of this article but shall be governed by the provisions of section 113-5. 
Nonconforming use means a nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located. (For example, a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use.) The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property. (For example, all the activity associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use.) 
(Prior Code, § 23-131)  
Sec. 101-260. - Continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this subpart and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in sections 101-261 through 101-266, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived may be continued. 
(b)  Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of section 101-266. 
(Prior Code, § 23-132)  
Sec. 101-261. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformance with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in section 113-5, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use (e.g., a two-family residence) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot. 
(b)  When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements (section 117-228) cannot reasonably be complied with, then the entity authorized by this subpart to issue a permit for the proposed use (the city planner or the city council) may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that: 
(1)  The proposed property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations; 
(2)  These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and 
(3)  The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(c)  For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(d)  This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with section 101-264. 
(e)  Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date this section becomes effective, an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed. 
(Prior Code, § 23-133)  
Sec. 101-262. - Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations. 
(a)  Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in an activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in: 
(1)  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or 
(2)  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements. 
(b)  Subject to subsection (d) of this section, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this subpart, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to section 101-266 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building. 
(c)  The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount to only changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other subsections of this section occur. 
(d)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements. This subsection is subject to the limitations stated in section 101-265 (abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations). 
(e)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, whenever there exists a lot with one or more structures on it; and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot; and the parking or loading requirements of chapter 111, article V, that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without additional land, and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with section 111-208: 
(1)  Parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required; and 
(2)  Such satellite parking is reasonably available. 
If such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special, or preliminary plat approval is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it becomes reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit. 
(Prior Code, § 23-134)  
Sec. 101-263. - Repair, maintenance and reconstruction. 
(a)  Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than 25 percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with an approved use permit issued pursuant to this section. 
(b)  If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 25 percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with an approved use permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to an approved use permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in section 101-262(d). 
(c)  For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section: 
(1)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement. 
(2)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsection (a) or (b) of this section by doing such work incrementally. 
(3)  The "appraised valuation" shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the land valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser. 
(d)  The city planner shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work: 
(1)  No violation of section 101-262 will occur; and 
(2)  The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this subpart applicable to the existing use (except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use). 
(e)  Compliance with a requirement of this subpart is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(Prior Code, § 23-135)  
Sec. 101-264. - Change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists. 
(a)  A change in use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) that is sufficiently substantial to require a new approved use, special-use, or preliminary plat approval in accordance with section 101-127 may not be made except in accordance with subsections (b) through (d) of this section. However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed. 
(b)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this subpart applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this subpart is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status. 
(c)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this subpart applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this subpart to issue a permit for that particular use (the city planner or city council) issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this subpart, that: 
(1)  The intended change will not result in a violation of section 101-262; and 
(2)  All of the applicable requirements of this subpart, that can reasonably be complied with, will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this subpart is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created. 
(d)  If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming, then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this subpart to issue a permit for that particular use (city planner or city council) issues a permit authorizing the change. The permit-issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to other findings that may be required by this subpart, that: 
(1)  The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either an approved use, special-use, or preliminary plat approval; 
(2)  All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection (c) of this section are satisfied; and 
(3)  The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for. 
(Prior Code, § 23-136)  
Sec. 101-265. - Abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations. 
(a)  When a nonconforming use is: 
(1)  Discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days; or 
(2)  Discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use; 
the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes. When a residential property is being actively marketed for tenants to continue the use, the use is not deemed to have stopped. 
(b)  If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is: 
(1)  Discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days; or 
(2)  Discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity; 
then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the pre-existing use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected. 
(c)  For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
(d)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived, the 180-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived. 
(Prior Code, § 23-137; Ord. No. 1641, 3-8-2010)  
Sec. 101-266. - Completion of nonconforming projects. 
(a)  All nonconforming projects approved before the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived can be continued. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. 
(b)  When it appears from the developer's plans that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under this subsection. The permit-issuing authority shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in addition to other relevant factors: 
(1)  Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural, or engineering work. 
(2)  Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not yet completed. 
(3)  Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or with approved but uncompleted phases, that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations.

(a)  Whenever a request to amend this subpart is initiated by the city council, planning and zoning commission, the board of adjustment, or city staff, the city attorney in consultation with the planning staff shall draft an appropriate ordinance and present that ordinance to the city council so that a date for a public hearing may be set. 
(b)  Any other person may also petition the city council to amend this subpart. The petition shall be filed with the city planner and shall include, among the information deemed relevant by the city planner: 
(1)  The name, address, and phone number of the applicant; 
(2)  A description of the land affected by the amendment if a change in a zoning district classification is proposed;

(a)  No ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this subpart may be adopted until a public hearing has been held on such ordinance. 
(b)  The city planner shall publish a notice of the public hearing on any ordinance that amends the provisions of this subpart one time in a paper with local circulation 15 days prior to the public meeting. 
(c)  With respect to minor map amendments, the applicant shall mail written notice of the public hearing to the record owners for tax purposes of all properties whose zoning classification is changed by the proposed amendment as well as the owners of all properties any portion of which is within 185 feet of the property rezoned by the amendment.

(5)  State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be made following the public hearing. 
(f)  The planning staff shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions set forth in this section. However, it is the city council's intention that no failure to comply with any of the notice provisions (except those set forth in subsection (b) of this section) shall render any amendment invalid. 
(Prior Code, § 23-343)  
Sec. 101-299. - City council action on amendments.

(Prior Code, § 23-344)  
Sec. 101-300. - Ultimate issue before city council on amendments. 
In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this subpart, the central issue before the city council is whether the proposed amendment advances public health, safety, or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the mayor and excluded. In particular, when considering proposed minor map amendments: 
(1)  The city council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that if the change is granted the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the city council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification. 
(2)  The city council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large. 
(Prior Code, § 23-345)  
Sec. 101-301. - Protests to zoning district changes.

b) Screening is provided in the form of a wood privacy fence or other suitable material providing 12-month opaque screening of the storage area. 
c) In circumstances where a rear storage area has street frontage (i.e., corner lots or rear street access), the street buffer yard requirements shall apply. 
4 Parking lots containing 15 or fewer spaces and are less than 35 feet in width are exempt from providing five percent interior green area. 
(Prior Code, § 23-238)  
Sec. 105-27. - Landscaping standards on lot. 
All commercial development is required to contain a minimum amount of landscaping in those areas designated as landscaped buffer yards. The requirement is that a certain number of landscape plant units as described in this section be planted per 1,000 square feet of required plantable area. Table 1.2 depicts the landscaping installation. 
TABLE 1.2 LANDSCAPE INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS 
	Minimum Number of 
Plant Units-Buffer Yard 	Interior Parking Lot Island 
Planting Requirements 
O, NC 	Two shade trees & five shrubs planted per 1,000 sq. ft. of buffer yard area, OFT. 1, 2, 3 	One shade tree & four shrubs planted per island 
GC 	Three shade trees & 6 shrubs planted per 1,000 sq. ft. of buffer yard area, OFT. 1, 2, 3 	One shade tree & five shrubs planted per island 
HC 	Three shade trees & 6 shrubs planted per 1,000 sq. ft. of buffer yard area, OFT. 1, 2, 3 	One shade tree & five shrubs planted per island 
M-1, M-2 	One shade tree & three shrubs per 1,000 sq. ft. of buffer yard area, OFT. 1, 2, 3 	One shade tree planted per island. 
 
1 Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the green space areas not occupied by landscape material. 
2 OFT means "or fraction thereof." Unless otherwise specified, trees do not have to be equally spaced, but may be grouped. The formulas above are to be used to determine the minimum amount of landscape treatment to be placed in the buffer yards; placement upon the site shall be determined by the owner and shown on the landscape plan. 
3 Plant materials at vehicular entrances should be located so as to maintain safe sight distances. 
(Prior Code, § 23-239)  
Sec. 105-28. - Interior parking lot landscaping requirements. 
(a)  The parking lot landscaping requirement serves several purposes: 
(1)  It provides necessary green space to give relief to expansive parking areas with nothing but asphalt; 
(2)  The trees provide shade and serve as windbreaks; and 
(3)  Planting islands also assist with vehicular circulation. 
(b)  Any parking lot of 15 or more spaces and/or containing a width greater than 35 feet shall provide interior landscaping. The following provisions are intended to require a percentage of green space for the entire parking lot, excluding the access drive (refer to Table 1.1 for percentage requirements). Diagram (A) below illustrates what areas of the vehicle accommodation area are considered when determining the total area of parking lot. Landscaped areas outside the parking lot may not be used to meet the interior planting requirements. 
(c)  Planting islands are required as a part of the green space percentage in the interior parking lot area. Diagram (B) below illustrates the parking island dimensions. The dimensions of a parking island must be the same as a parking stall, and must be curbed to protect the landscaping and trees. Planting islands shall be located within the parking lot, such that each island or planter is surrounded on at least three sides by parking lot or an access road to the parking lot. One parking island is required for every 15 parking spaces required on site. If 13 or more spaces remain, a parking island is required. The planting islands must be evenly spaced among the parking spaces in the lot and serve as vehicular circulation whenever possible. 
(d)  Landscaping treatments are required to be planted in the interior parking lot planting islands. Landscaping vegetation offers shade from the heat and sun. Table 1.2 contains the amount of landscape treatment required per planting island, the balance of the islands shall be planted in grass or other vegetative ground cover. Required trees must be planted within the island leaving a four-foot clearance for car doors to open from the adjacent parking lot. 
 
(Prior Code, § 23-240)  
Sec. 105-29. - Minimum tree and shrub planting or preservation requirements. 
Standards have been established for installation of all plant materials within the city. These requirements must be followed in order to receive approval of the site work and final occupancy or approval of the development. 
(1)  Trees shall not be placed where they interfere with site drainage or where they shall require frequent pruning in order to avoid interference with overhead power lines. A minimum of 75 percent of all required trees shall be shade trees. 
(2)  Immediately upon planting, trees shall be a minimum of eight feet tall and shall have a minimum caliper (widest width of trunk) of two inches. 
(3)  When more than ten trees are to be planted to meet the requirements of this article, a mix of species shall be provided. The number of species to be planted shall vary according to the overall number of trees required to be planted. The minimum number of species to be planted is listed in the table below. Species shall be planted in proportion to the required mix. This species mix shall not apply to areas of vegetation required to be preserved by law. 
Required Species Mix 
Required Number of Trees 	Minimum Number of Species 
1120 	2 
2130 	3 
3140 	4 
41 + 	5 
 
(4)  Hedges, where required, shall form a solid continuous visual screen of at least three feet in height immediately upon planting and shall be spaced 18 inches on center. Hedge plantings shall be maintained so as not to exceed a height of six feet. 
(Prior Code, § 23-241)  
Sec. 105-30. - Additional landscape treatment. 
(a)  All interior landscaped areas not dedicated to trees or to preservation of existing vegetation shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, shrubs, or other appropriate landscape treatment. Gravel or other pavement shall not be considered appropriate landscape treatment. 
(b)  In order to preserve sight distance, an unobstructed view shall be maintained within these triangular areas: 
(1)  At the intersection of two streets, or where a street intersects with an alley: a triangle defined by measuring 30 feet in length along each curb or edge of roadway from their point of intersection, the third side being a diagonal line connecting the first two. The city may require a greater distance in certain higher volume or higher speed traffic intersections. 
(2)  At the intersection of a driveway and street: two sides of the triangle defined by measuring 15 feet in length along the edge of the driveway and along the curb or edge of roadway line from their point of intersection, the third side being a diagonal line connecting the first two. 
In no instance shall vegetation or ornaments be planted or placed within these areas that exceed 36 inches above grade of the lower roadway. 
(c)  Except as provided below, all landscape areas at the front line of off-street parking spaces may be protected from encroachment or intrusion of vehicles through the use of wheel stops. Wheel stops shall have a minimum height of six inches above the finished grade of the parking area. Wheel stops shall be properly anchored and shall be continuously maintained in good condition by the property owner. Wheel stops shall not be placed in locations of anticipated intense pedestrian traffic. 
(d)  Trees and other vegetation shall be planted in soil and climatic conditions which are appropriate for their growth habits. Plants used in the landscape design shall be to the greatest extent: 
(1)  Appropriate to the conditions in which they are to be planted; 
(2)  Have non-invasive growth habits; 
(3)  Encourage low maintenance, high-quality design; and 
(4)  Be otherwise consistent with the intent of this article. 
(e)  Replacement requirements for vegetation that is required to be planted or preserved by this article shall be replaced with equivalent vegetation if it is not living within one year of issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Preserved trees for which credit was awarded but which subsequently die, shall be replaced by the requisite number of living trees according to the standards set forth in this article. 
(Prior Code, § 23-242)  
Sec. 105-31. - Enforcement and maintenance. 
(a)  The city planner or a person designated by him has the authority to enforce the requirements of this article. Final occupancy permits and/or final plats will be held for those who fail to complete landscaping requirements. The property owner will maintain, in good repair, all on-site trees and vegetation. 
(b)  The city planner or other person designated by him has the authority to deny the issuance of a final occupancy permit until landscaping is installed according to the requirements of this article and to the satisfaction of the site inspector. 
(Prior Code, § 23-243)  
Sec. 105-32. - Alternative methods of compliance. 
(a)  An application for alternative landscaping schemes is justified only when one or more of the following conditions apply: 
(1)  The site involves space limitations or is an unusually shaped parcel. 
(2)  Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such that full compliance is impossible or impractical. 
(3)  Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required buffer yard is larger than can be provided. 
(4)  Safety considerations require a change. 
(b)  The applicant shall describe in a letter to the development department which of the requirements set forth in the manual will be met with modifications where project conditions justify using alternatives, and how the proposed measures equal or exceed normal compliance. 
(Prior Code, § 23-244)  
Sec. 105-33. - List of recommended trees and shrubs. 
(a)  The following lists indicate plantings that would meet the landscaping requirements of this article. The lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora that would be appropriate for screening and shading purposes. Plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to four principal criteria: 
(1)  General suitability for the climate and soil conditions of this area; 
(2)  Ease of maintenance; 
(3)  Tolerance of city conditions; and 
(4)  Availability from area nurseries. 
(b)  When selecting new plantings for a particular site, a developer should first consider the types of plants that are thriving on or near that site. However, if an introduced species has proven highly effective for screening or shading in this area, it too may be a proper selection.

DIVISION 2. - SCREENING AND BUFFER YARDS 
 
Sec. 105-57. - City council findings concerning the need for screening requirements. 
The city council finds that: 
(1)  Screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust, and glare. 
(2)  Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area. Even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces, and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use. 
(3)  Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening. 
(4)  The provisions of this division are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Prior Code, § 23-247)  
Sec. 105-58. - General screening standard. 
Every development shall provide sufficient screening so that: 
(1)  Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development; 
(2)  The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as major streets or railroads.

Sec. 105-59. - Descriptions of screens. 
The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth in section 105-58. 
(1)  Opaque screen, type A is a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. 
(2)  Semi-opaque screen, type B is a screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. 
(3)  Broken screen, type C is a screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants. 
(Prior Code, § 23-249)  
Sec. 105-60. - Fences. 
(a)  Applicability of provisions. The regulations set forth in this section shall govern all fences to be constructed within the city. 
(b)  Site plan and building permit are required. No fence shall be permitted until all on-site utilities have been located and a permit has been issued in the manner now provided for by city ordinance for the issuance of building permits. 
(c)  Front yard fences. Except in districts zoned for commercial or industrial uses, no fence, barrier wall or other obstruction shall be placed or constructed between the parallel street right-of-way line and front setback line; however, it shall be permissible to construct a fence, which meets the following criteria: 
(1)  Visibility through the fence shall not be less than 50 percent; and 
(2)  The fence shall not exceed 48 inches in height when chain link or 36 inches when wood slats. 
(d)  Permitted: generally eight-foot limit. Except as set forth in this article, fences shall be permitted that do not exceed eight feet in height. 
(e)  Clearance from drainage easement, side-yard street frontage and meters, and gates required by city planner: 
(1)  Fences of drainage easements are only allowed in the following circumstances: 
a.  A drainage easement surrounding a detention/retention pond may be fenced, provided that a stormwater engineer provides information demonstrating that fencing of the drainage easement will not diminish the ability of the detention/retention facility to function as designed. Fences meeting the above criteria must be constructed using a chainlink or shadow box style fence. 
b.  A grass-lined drainage easement may be fenced in circumstances where the grass-lined ditch is designed to carry less than ten cubic feet per second of volume and has a drainage area of less than 2½ acres. Fences in a grass lined easement meeting the above criteria must be constructed using a chainlink or shadow box style fence. 
(2)  Fences constructed along the side yard adjacent to a street shall have a minimum of a ten-foot setback from the back of curb or setback to the property line, whichever is greater. 
(3)  If the electric meter is on the side of the house, no fence shall be constructed which obstructs the ability to read the electric meter. In circumstances where fulfilling this requirement would prohibit a property owner from obtaining a fence permit, a fence permit may be released if a gate is installed or visibility is given through the fence to allow safe access to read and/or repair said meter.

DIVISION 3. - SHADING 
 
Sec. 105-79. - City council findings and declaration of policy on shade trees. 
(a)  The city council finds that: 
(1)  Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival; 
(2)  Trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breath; 
(3)  Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems; 
(4)  Trees have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers; 
(5)  Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control; 
(6)  Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land, particularly parking areas; and 
(7)  For the reasons indicated in subsection (a)(6), trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values. 
(b)  Based upon the findings set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the city council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health, safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the city limits to protect certain existing trees and, under the circumstances set forth in this article, to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments. 
(Prior Code, § 23-261)  
Sec. 105-80. - Retention and protection of large trees. 
(a)  Every development shall retain all existing trees 18 inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development. 
(b)  No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more, and no impervious surface (including, but not limited to, paving or buildings) may be located within 12½ feet (measured from the centerline of the trunk) of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development. For purposes of this subsection, a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground. 
(c)  The retention or protection of trees 18 inches in diameter or more as provided in subsection (a) and (b) of this section unreasonably burdens a development if, to accomplish such retention or protection, the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer. 
(d)  If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in article V of chapter 111 cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces "lost" because of the provisions of subsection (a) and (b) of this section, up to a maximum of 15 percent of the required spaces.

Sec. 107-4. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of obstructions in any designated floodway causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Prior Code, § 22-2)  
Sec. 107-5. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter: 
(1)  To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 107-4; 
(2)  To establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22 (a)(3); and 
(3)  To meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
a.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
b.  Requires uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
c.  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Prior Code, § 22-3)

(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (b) through (f) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory of historic places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
(Prior Code, § 22-23)  
Sec. 107-79. - Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures.

The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with section 107-103(a)(3). 
(6)  The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provision of section 107-103(b)(2). No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood. 
(7)  Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
(8)  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by a federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
(9)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life an property. 
Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
(10)  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

(2)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures which will not increase the demand for public facilities. 
(3)  The replacement of a residential building or structure of the same size and use, as long as no additional dwellings are added as such term is defined by section 101-2. 
(4)  The replacement of a nonresidential building or structure with a building of the same size and use, as long as there is no increase in the demand for public facilities. 
(5)  Any building permit issued pursuant to a final plat that was validly approved as of the date that this chapter was adopted. 
(6)  Any building permit issued pursuant to a final plat, where: 
a.  The preliminary plat was validly approved as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; and 
b.  A final plat pursuant to the preliminary plat is approved by January 31, 2006, and a building permit or construction must occur by January 1, 2007. If a final plat is not approved by this date, impact fees shall be paid for all building permits for impact generating land development within the proposed subdivision. 
(7)  Public school districts. 
(d)  Time of payment. All impact fees except the police impact fee shall be collected for the shell building at the time of issuance of a building permit, and the police impact fee shall be paid at the time an infill permit is submitted by the tenant. 
(e)  Dedication of land or facilities. Any land or facilities agreed to be dedicated to the city as a condition of development approval shall be dedicated by either easement or deed, at the discretion of the city, no later than the time at which impact fees are required to be paid under this section.

(Prior Code, § 23-467; Ord. No. 1363, 8-2005)  
Sec. 109-9. - Individual assessment. 
(a)  Applicability. One, several, or all components of the impact fee shall be computed by the use of an individual assessment if: 
(1)  The city planner determines that the type of impact generating land development being commenced is not one of those types listed on the fee schedule in section 101-11, fee schedule; or 
(2)  The potential fee payer chooses to have the amount of the fee determined by the use of an individual assessment. 
(b)  Preparation of individual assessment. 
(1)  The potential fee payer shall prepare the individual assessment if the potential fee payer chooses to conduct the analysis. 
(2)  The person who prepares the individual assessment shall be a qualified professional in the preparation of impact analysis, and shall be approved by the city planner or a city official (whichever is appropriate), on the basis of professional training and experience. 
(c)  Individual assessment standards. The individual assessment shall determine if the proposed impact generating land development is designed or located so that the development will demand the use of public facilities more or less than that projected in the fee schedule. The city planner or a city official (whichever is appropriate) must approve the methodology in writing prior to the applicant undertaking the individual assessment study. 
(d)  Individual assessment procedure. 
(1)  Submission of application. An individual assessment shall be undertaken by submitting an application of assessment of fiscal impact for the facility component for which an assessment is requested. A potential fee payer may submit such an application at the fee payer's discretion. The city shall submit such an application for any proposed Impact generating land development interpreted as not one of those types listed on the fee schedule. 
(2)  Determination of completeness. Within 20 days of receipt of an application, the city planner shall determine if the application is complete. If it is determined that the application is not complete, a written statement shall be sent to the applicant, by mail, specifying the deficiencies. The application shall be deemed complete if no deficiencies are specified. The city planner shall take no further action on the application until it is deemed complete. 
(3)  Review of application. Within 30 days of the date the application is determined to be complete, the city planner shall review the application and render a written decision on whether the fee should be modified, and if so, what the amount should be. 
(e)  Calculation of individual assessment. If, on the basis of generally recognized principles of impact analysis, it is determined the data, information and assumptions used by the applicant to calculate the individual assessment satisfies the requirements of this section and the standards in subsection (c) of this section, the fee determined in the individual assessment shall be deemed the fee due and owing for the proposed impact generating land development. The adjustment shall be set forth in a fee agreement which shall be entered into pursuant to section 109-5(f). If the independent fee calculation study fails to satisfy the requirements of this section, the fee applied shall be that fee established in the fee schedule pursuant to section 101-11. 
(Prior Code, § 23-468; Ord. No. 1363, 8-2005)  
Sec. 109-10. - Appeal.

(Prior Code, § 23-470; Ord. No. 1363, 8-2005)  
Sec. 109-12. - Benefit districts. 
The city finds and determines that the public facilities that will be provided or expanded pursuant to this chapter provide a benefit to fee payers within any area within the incorporated boundaries of the city. Accordingly, the incorporated area of the city is hereby designated as a benefit district for the impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter. No impact fee collected pursuant to this chapter shall be expended for a public facility that is located outside of the benefit district, or that does not provide capacity that serves or is available to serve a fee payer within the benefit district. 
(Prior Code, § 23-471; Ord. No. 1363, 8-2005)  
Sec. 109-13. - Use of funds. 
(a)  Intent. Fees collected for each component under this chapter are expressly designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable to the proposed development. 
(b)  Establishment of trust fund and trust accounts. There is hereby established the city Impact Fee Trust Fund for the purpose of insuring that the fees collected pursuant to this chapter are designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable to new impact generating land development. A separate trust fund account shall be established for each public facility for which impact fees are allocated pursuant to this chapter. 
(c)  Deposit and management of trust fund. 
(1)  City. All fees collected by the city shall be immediately deposited into the appropriate trust account in the city Impact Fee Trust Fund. The term "appropriate trust account" means the account that is attributable to the public facility for which the impact fee was collected. Impact fees shall not be placed in trust accounts or expended for public facilities, or any other purpose, other than the specific public facility category for which the impact fee was collected. 
(2)  Investment of proceeds. All proceeds shall be invested in an interest bearing account. All income derived from these investments shall be retained in the trust fund until transferred or spent, whichever is appropriate. A record of each trust fund account shall be available for public inspection. 
(d)  Limitation on expenditure of fees in trust account. Proceeds collected pursuant to this chapter shall be spent only on capacity-adding public facilities within the city, the need for which is created by and the provision of which will substantially benefit new impact-generating land development. Impact fee proceeds shall not be appropriated for operation or maintenance costs. 
(e)  Annual recommendation for expenditure of fees. Each year, at the time the annual budget is reviewed, the city planner shall propose appropriations to be spent from the individual trust accounts to the city council which include recommendations for the expenditure of the fee monies. After review of the recommendations, the city council shall approve, modify, or deny the recommended expenditures of the trust account funds. Any amounts not appropriated from the trust accounts together with any interest earnings shall be carried over in the specific trust account to the following fiscal period. 
(Prior Code, § 23-472; Ord. No. 1363, 8-2005)  
Sec. 109-14. - Return of fees. 
(a)  Generally. Any fees collected shall be returned to the fee payer or a successor in interest if the fees have not been spent within seven years from the date the building permit for the development was issued, along with all interest earned. Provided, however, that the city council may by resolution extend for up to three years the date at which fees must be refunded. Such an extension shall be made upon a finding that within such three year period, specific capital improvements are planned and evidenced by the adoption and incorporation into the comprehensive plan, that these capital improvements shall be constructed within the next three years, that these improvements are reasonably attributable to the fee payer's impact generating land development; and that the fees whose time of refund is extended shall be spent for these capital improvements. Fees shall be deemed to be spent on the basis of: the first fee collected shall be the first fee spent. 
(b)  Procedure. The refund of fees shall be undertaken through the following process. 
(1)  Generally. A refund application shall be submitted within one year following the end of the seventh year from the date on which the building permit was issued on the proposed development. If the time of refund has been extended pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the refund application shall be submitted within one year following the end of this extension. The refund application shall include the following information: 
a.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee; 
b.  A copy of the certificate of occupancy permit; 
c.  A copy of the receipt issued by the city for payment of the fee; and 
d.  If applicable, evidence that the applicant is the successor in interest to the fee payer. 
(2)  Determination of completeness. Within 20 days of receipt of the refund application, the city planner shall determine if it is complete. If the city planner determines the application is not complete, a written statement specifying the deficiencies shall be sent by mail to the person submitting the application. Unless the deficiencies are corrected, the city planner shall take no further action on the refund application. 
(3)  Review and decision. When the city planner determines the refund application is complete, it shall be reviewed within 20 days. 
(4)  Standards. The refund application shall be approved if it is determined the fee payer or the fee payer's successor in interest has paid a fee which the city has not spent within the period of time permitted under this section. The refund shall include the fee paid plus interest earned. 
(5)  Appeal. Any fee payer or the fee payer's successor in interest may appeal the decision of a refund application by filing a petition with the city council within 30 days of the decision. In reviewing the decision, the city council shall use the standards established in subsection (b)(4) of this section (standards).

Chapter 111 - INFRASTRUCTURE, PARKING, ETC.  
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 111-1. - Utility ownership and easement rights. 
In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of water, wastewater or electrical power and intends that such facilities shall be owned, operated, or maintained by the city, the developer shall transfer to the city the necessary ownership or easement rights to enable the city to operate and maintain such facilities. 
(Prior Code, § 23-291)  
Sec. 111-2. - As-built drawings required. 
Whenever a developer installs or causes to be installed any utility line in any public right-of-way, the developer shall, as soon as practicable after installation is complete, and before acceptance of any water or wastewater line, furnish the city with a copy of such a drawing that shows the exact location of such utility lines. Such drawings must be verified as accurate by the utility service provider. Compliance with this requirement shall be a condition of the continued validity of the permit authorizing such development. 
(Prior Code, § 23-301)  
Sec. 111-3. - Utilities to be consistent with internal and external development. 
(a)  Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby developments, such utility facilities (e.g., water and wastewater lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be made conveniently and without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service. 
(b)  All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue damage to improvements or facilities located within the development. 
(Prior Code, § 23-300)  
Sec. 111-4. - Lighting requirements. 
(a)  Subject to subsection (b) of this section, all public streets, sidewalks, and other common areas or facilities in subdivisions created after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such streets, sidewalks, and other common areas. 
(b)  To the extent that fulfillment of the requirement established in subsection (a) of this section would normally require street lights installed along public streets, this requirement shall be applicable only to subdivisions located within the corporate limits of the city. 
(c)  All roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common areas and facilities in unsubdivided developments shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common areas and facilities. 
(d)  All entrances and exits in substantial buildings used for nonresidential purposes and in two-family or multifamily residential developments containing more than four dwelling units shall be adequately lighted to ensure the safety of persons and the security of the buildings. 
(Prior Code, § 23-297)  
Sec. 111-5. - Electric power. 
Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a source of electric power adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such subdivision. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  If the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing telephone line and the use can be served by a simple connection to such power line (as opposed to a more complex distribution system, such as would be required in an apartment complex or shopping center), then no further certification is needed. 
(2)  If the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing power line or a substantial internal distribution system will be necessary, then the electric supervisor must review the proposed plans and certify to the city that it can provide service that is adequate to meet the needs of the proposed use and every lot within the proposed subdivision. 
(Prior Code, § 23-298)  
Sec. 111-6. - Underground electricity. 
Underground electric service is an option for developers. The procedures are outlined in the underground electric policy for the city outlined in the Technical Specifications Manual. 
(Prior Code, § 23-299)  
Sec. 111-7. - Fire hydrants. 
(a)  Every development (subdivided or unsubdivided) that is served by a public water system shall include a system of fire hydrants sufficient to provide adequate fire protection for the buildings located or intended to be located within such development. 
(b)  The presumption established by this chapter is that to satisfy the standard set forth in subsection (a) of this section, fire hydrants must be located so that all parts of every building within the development may be served by a hydrant. Fire hydrants shall not be more than 400 feet apart in distance by street access. However, the water and wastewater superintendent may authorize or require a deviation from this standard if in his professional opinion another arrangement more satisfactorily complies with the standards set forth in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  The water and wastewater superintendent shall determine the precise location of all fire hydrants, subject to the other provisions of this section. In general, fire hydrants shall be placed six feet behind the curbline of publicly dedicated streets that have curb and gutter. 
(d)  The water and wastewater superintendent shall determine the design standards of all hydrants based on fire flow needs. Unless otherwise specified by the fire chief, all hydrants shall have two 2½-inch hose connections and one 4½-inch hose connection. The 2½-inch hose connections shall be located at least 2½ inches from the ground level. All hydrant threads shall be national standard threads. 
(e)  Water lines that serve hydrants shall be at least six-inch lines, and, unless no other practicable alternative is available, no such lines shall be dead-end lines. 
(Prior Code, § 23-302)  
Sec. 111-8. - Sites for and screening of dumpsters. 
(a)  Every development that, under the city's solid waste collection policies, is or will be required to provide one or more dumpsters for solid waste collection shall provide sites for such dumpsters that are: 
(1)  Located so as to facilitate collection and minimize any negative impact on persons occupying the development site, neighboring properties, or public rights-of-way; and 
(2)  Constructed according to specifications established by the solid waste collector to allow for the collection without damage to the development site or the collection vehicle.

(Prior Code, § 23-437)  
Sec. 111-68. - Street name assignments. 
(a)  The approval process for new street names may be initiated as part of any of the following development approval procedures. Applicants for preliminary subdivision plan review are encouraged to seek street name approval as part of the preliminary plat application. 
(b)  Preliminary plat for major subdivision. Street names may be submitted for approval with a preliminary plat for major subdivision. Approval of the preliminary plat with street names may be given at the time of preliminary plat approval. 
(c)  Final plat. Approved street names shall be shown on all final plats recorded at the county recorders office. 
(d)  Minor subdivision. Street names must be submitted for approval with a minor subdivision plat. When recorded, minor subdivision plats must reflect the approved street name. 
(Prior Code, § 23-438)  
Sec. 111-69. - Street name guidelines. 
(a)  Duplication of existing street names not permitted. To eliminate potential confusion and delay of emergency response, duplication of street names shall not be permitted. Streets with the same name but different street type designations shall be considered duplicate street names (e.g., Wasson Drive and Wasson Road are duplicates). Proposed street names and name changes shall be compared with existing street names of both the city and county name index to determine if the proposed street name would create a duplicate name. 
(b)  Similar or confusing spelling of street names not permitted. To eliminate confusion resulting from diction problems when individuals are reporting street names under stress, similar (text or phonetic) or confusing spelling of street names shall not be approved. The following are examples of the issues described above. 
Example 	Problem 
Stonehenge vs. Stonehedge 	Similar Spelling 
Rumplestiltskin 	Difficult to Spell 
Jotunheimen 	Obscure 
Phunny 	Phonetically confusing spelling 
 
(c)  Length of street names. Street names of 12 or fewer characters are encouraged to maximize visibility of street signs. New street names shall not contain more than 16 characters, which does not include either the direction (north, east, etc.) or the street type (lane, drive, etc.). Names shall not contain hyphens, apostrophes, or other non-letter characters. New street names shall not contain more than two words, exclusive of direction or street type. 
(d)  Use of directional indicators in street names. Directional indicators, such as north and west, shall not be included in street name proposals as a prefix or suffix to a street name. Upon acceptance by the E911 mapping department, the appropriate direction indicator shall be added as part of the approval process dependent upon located in relation to the east/west or north/south zero baseline. 
(e)  No separate name is to be used for a cul-de-sac that provides street frontage for three or less lots or units. The name shall be the same as that of the intersecting street. 
(f)  In circumstances where a street changes directions abruptly, generally greater than 45 degrees, a new street name shall be assigned.

Sec. 111-70. - Continuation of street names. 
(a)  The assignment of continuous street names, or street names assigned to grid lines, shall be given to new thoroughfares that have the same basic alignment with an existing street. 
(b)  To help reduce the total number of names within the system, new street names will not be issued to streets that fall within an address grid line with an established name. New street names can only be issued if a current linear street name cannot be used, or to designated collector and arterial thoroughfares that have a special or unique alignment and configuration. 
(c)  Street names shall not be changed due to a change in direction of the street, nor shall a new prefix be used for those streets that meet the criteria for using a directional indicator in the street name.

Secs. 111-71111-98. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 3. - ADDRESSING 
 
Sec. 111-99. - Addressing agency. 
The E911 mapping department shall establish and assign street address numbers in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. All buildings used for residential, commercial, institutional or governmental purposes shall be provided with an address identifying the building. 
(Prior Code, § 23-441)  
Sec. 111-100. - Address numbering grid. 
(a)  The purpose of the address numbering grid is to provide a more uniform and orderly spacing of block numbers. Each new subdivision parcel, each pad in a mobile home park, commercial unit, apartment, condominium, or townhouse shall be assigned an address on the street providing access to the parcels. Addresses will be assigned based on a grid system. 
(b)  The grid system allows a series of numbers to be assigned for approximately every 500 feet. The address grid includes the NW, NE, SW, and SE quadrants of the city and uses primary routes within the city as zero baselines. 
(Prior Code, § 23-442)  
Sec. 111-101. - Address grid baselines. 
(a)  The city E911 address numbering system shall be on a grid system dividing the address area into quadrants establishing zero baselines from which numbers are assigned. The grid baseline identifies the point at which block numbers will change in increments of 100. 
(b)  Assigned address numbers under the grid system will ascend numerically from 100 to the north and to the south based on Mount Vernon as the boundary zero baseline for streets that are aligned north and south of Mount Vernon. Streets that are aligned east and west shall be assigned address numbers ascending numerically from 100 to the east and to the west based on Main St. representing the boundary zero baseline. 
(Prior Code, § 23-443)  
Sec. 111-102. - Application of address grid. 
Application of the address grid will vary, as few streets run directly north, south, east or west. Most streets run at angles to the cardinal directions and often change direction. The primary consideration for assigning addresses on streets that diverge from the cardinal directions is the even distribution of address numbers. The grid shall be used to assist in assigning numbers by orienting the grid parallel to the direction of the street. In this manner, an appropriate distance between address numbers can be maintained. 
(Prior Code, § 23-444)  
Sec. 111-103. - Even/odd numbers. 
(a)  The north side of east/west streets and the east side of north/south streets shall be assigned odd numbers. 
(b)  The south side of east/west streets and the west side of north/south streets shall be assigned even numbers. 
(c)  The original odd or even designation shall be continued throughout the drive regardless of change in compass direction. 
(Prior Code, § 23-445)  
Sec. 111-104. - Streets; frequency of numbers. 
Every 25 feet of ground or fraction of a lot less than 25 feet fronting upon each street shall have one number. This will yield approximately 400 numbers per mile, 200 odd on one side and 200 even on the other side. 
(Prior Code, § 23-446)  
Sec. 111-105. - Private rights-of-way. 
In situations where three or more structures are located on a private, un-named right-of-way, the private drive shall be named. Once a street name has been approved a standard street name sign shall be installed. The structures shall then be numbered according to these principles using the number interval method. 
(Prior Code, § 23-447)  
Sec. 111-106. - Loop or circular streets. 
The properties fronting circle streets shall be numbered without regard to the change in direction. Continuous even or odd numbers shall be assigned around the outside, and the appropriate opposite even or odd number shall be assigned continuously around the inside of the circle. In some cases this will result in fewer numbers on the inside of the circle. Adjustments will be made where necessary to provide numbers with similar numeric value for properties which face each other along the street. 
(Prior Code, § 23-448)  
Sec. 111-107. - Corner lots. 
When assigning numbers to corner lots, the front door shall be used. When the front door is obscured or if the structure is best reached for emergency purposes by the driveway, assign the property number based on where the driveway falls on the road. 
(Prior Code, § 23-449)  
Sec. 111-108. - Curvilinear streets. 
To assign numbers, consideration must be given to the overall direction of the entire street and the pattern of existing and future development. The street numbers shall be determined from the grid axis that is most nearly at a right angle to the overall direction of the street. 
(Prior Code, § 23-450)  
Sec. 111-109. - Single-family lots. 
Addresses for single-family dwelling lots shall be assigned consecutively on the odd and even sides of the street. 
(Prior Code, § 23-451)  
Sec. 111-110. - Mobile home parks. 
Addresses for home sites in mobile home parks are assigned consecutively on the odd and even sides of the street. A separate street address number shall be assigned for each mobile home pad or lot. 
(Prior Code, § 23-452)  
Sec. 111-111. - Multifamily apartments. 
(a)  Multifamily housing units, such as apartments and condominiums, will have a separate whole number street address assigned to each individual building. Street addresses shall be assigned based on the normal criteria for assignment. 
(b)  Within the individual structures, separate dwelling units shall be assigned apartment numbers as secondary location indicators. Structures having multiple levels with dwelling units placed one above another will receive a consecutive whole unit number assigned from the left to right as viewed from the common entrance. The lowest floor shall begin with 101, 102, 103, etc., until all units have been assigned unit numbers. Successively higher floors shall begin with successively higher increments of 100s. The complete official street address for each unit will consist of the street address, street name, and unit number. 
(Prior Code, § 23-453)  
Sec. 111-112. - Commercial development. 
Commercial developments shall be numbered just as apartments, with one street address applied to each individual building, with additional addresses for the buildings consisting of suite numbers. Commercial buildings will be numbered with the middle of the building determining the number of the building with offices or businesses in the building numbered as suites (e.g.: 625 E. Mt. Vernon, Suite 34).

(e)  Whenever an extension of the city water department distribution system is necessary in order to serve an applicant whose premises are located within an area served by the city, the city shall extend its water mains along any public highways which are laid out in which grades have been established and which are dedicated to public use within its service area, provided: 
(1)  Such applicant, requesting extension of the city water distribution system shall execute and deliver, without cost, to the city, such easement indentures as in the opinion of the city are or may be required at the time such extension is made or may be required in the future to extend the water distribution system to an applicant located adjacent to the premises to be served by such extension. 
(2)  There is deposited with the city a nonrefundable cash deposit which equals in the amount the estimated cost of extending the water distribution system to the applicant. Said amount shall include the cost of a performance bond as well as a one-year maintenance bond on said extension. 
(f)  Where the provisions of subsection (e) of this section are otherwise satisfied and the applicant concerned has promptly and faithfully performed in the past all contractual obligations with the city and he is desirous of directly constructing at his own expense a water distribution extension rather than depositing estimated costs with the city and having the city construct such extension, the city council may approve such extension, provided that the authorized agent of the applicant, as shown by an executed power of attorney on file with the city, executes a form of contract acceptable to the city, which, among other provisions, provides that: 
(1)  In its entirety the extension is constructed in strict accord with the construction specifications, drawings and plans prepared by or on behalf of the city, and approval of such extension is given by the DNR. 
(2)  All work on construction and extension shall be at the applicant sole cost and subject to inspection by and approval of the city; that such construction is in strict accord with the extensions, constructions, specifications, drawings, and plans; and all expenses incurred by the city, as a result of the extension, including but not limited to preliminary engineering, preparation of specifications, drawings, performance bonds, one-year maintenance bond, plans and inspection of construction shall be paid by the applicant.

Editor's note Ord. No. 1996, § I, adopted May 29, 2018, amended Art. IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. IV, §§ 111-168111-181, pertained to telecommunication towers, and derived from Prior Code, § 23-39123-403; Ord. No. 1919, 12-19-2016. 
 
Sec. 111-168. - Purpose and legislative intent. 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Nixa's authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The city finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the city and its inhabitants. The city also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the city and of significant benefit to the city and its residents. To ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the city's land use policies, the city is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of [the] local ordinance [from which this article is derived] is to minimize the impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure and integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities, protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Nixa and to comply with applicable law, including the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Missouri Uniform Wireless Communication Infrastructure Deployment Act.

These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as satellite parking spaces. 
(b)  All such satellite parking spaces must be located within 400 feet of the use or building which is the subject of an application for joint use of parking. 
(c)  The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactorily written evidence that he has permission of the owner or other persons in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The written evidence shall at a minimum consist of a perpetual, mutual parking/access easement submitted for review by the city planner and duly filed and recorded with the county recorder; said easement shall include a specific time schedule for the availability of parking by use. The demand for available parking created by each of the uses must occur at separate times, thereby eliminating a conflict of need.

However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available. 
(Prior Code, § 23-333)  
Sec. 111-210. - Loading and unloading areas. 
(a)  Whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner. 
(b)  The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in question. The following table indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard set forth in this subsection. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more or less loading and unloading area if necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard. 
Gross Leaseable Area of Building 	Number of Spaces* 
1,00019,999 	1 
20,00079,999 	2 
80,000127,999 	3

*Minimum dimensions of 12 feet x 55 feet and overhead clearance of 14 feet from street grade required. 
(c)  Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use them can perform all maneuvering and staging on the lot without using the public right-of-way. 
(d)  No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirement for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities. 
(e)  Whenever: 
(1)  There exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; 
(2)  A change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot; and 
(3)  The loading area requirements of this section cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can be used practically for loading and unloading; 
then the developer need only comply with this section to the extent reasonably possible.

Sec. 113-2. - Scope. 
All signs and sign support structures shall conform to the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable provisions of this Code. When confronted with an infraction of the city's sign code regulations, the code administrator shall present a business card to identify himself and assist in making inquiries relative to the city's sign code. 
(Prior Code, § 23-311)  
Sec. 113-3. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this title is to promote the public safety and welfare: 
(1)  To improve the visual environment and foster economic development while providing adequate standards for meeting sign owners needs; 
(2)  To benefit the public and sign owners through improved sign legibility, readability and visibility; 
(3)  To provide equal opportunity for the display of commercial messages; 
(4)  To ensure the design, construction, installation, repair and maintenance of signs will not interfere with traffic safety, or otherwise endanger public safety; 
(5)  To ensure that city rights-of-way are not appropriated to private use or used in a manner inconsistent with the public interest; 
(6)  To reduce incompatibility between signs and their surroundings; 
(7)  To ensure that an adequate opportunity will be available to sign users without dominating the visual appearance of the area. 
(Prior Code, § 23-312)  
Sec. 113-4. - Conflicts with other provisions. 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions of any other ordinance or regulation applicable to signs. Signs located in areas governed by several ordinances and/or applicable regulations shall comply with all such ordinances and regulations. If there is a conflict between this chapter and any other ordinance or regulation, the more stringent shall apply. 
(Prior Code, § 23-313; Ord. No. 1526, 3-10-2008)  
Sec. 113-5. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be continued until they are required to be removed under this section. 
(b)  No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no conforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition. Nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 
(c)  A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this chapter. 
(d)  If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformance with all the provisions of this chapter, and remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign so damaged. 
(e)  The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformance (for example, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed). 
(f)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed 50 percent of the value (appraised or tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign. 
(g)  If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed within 30 days after such abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other party having control over the sign. 
(h)  If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with this article or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is blank if: 
(1)  It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; 
(2)  The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part; or 
(3)  The advertising copy paid for by a party other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed.

ARTICLE II. - PERMITS 
 
Sec. 113-29. - Display of signs; permit required. 
(a)  No sign shall be displayed in the city limits until the city has issued a permit for it, unless it is exempt from a permit in accordance with section 113-31. No permit shall be issued unless the applicant demonstrates that the proposed sign meets the requirements of this Code. All face changes, except changeable copy signs, shall require a permit. Mere repainting or changing the message of a sign shall not, in and of itself, be considered a substantial alteration. Minimum submittal requirements and sign permit applications are available in the planning and development department, www.nixa.com/planning and development/building. 
(b)  If plans submitted for an approved use permit, special use permit, or preliminary plat include sign plans in sufficient detail that the permit-issuing authority can determine whether the proposed sign or signs comply with the provisions of this chapter, then issuance of the requested approved use permit, special use permit, or preliminary plat shall constitute approval of the proposed sign or signs. 
(c)  No sign except a public sign shall be located on any city-owned utility pole or within public rights-of-way. 
(Prior Code, § 23-314; Ord. No. 1526, 3-10-2008)  
Sec. 113-30. - Permits to be withheld; illegal or prohibited signs on parcel.

Sec. 113-31. - Signs exempt from permit.

(c)  Signage falling within the above categories, except an off-site real estate sign, which can be posted Friday afternoon and removed Monday morning, may be erected off-site for a period not to exceed 48 hours. The signs may be no larger than two feet by two feet with a maximum height of three feet from the ground level. In addition to advertising language, the signs shall contain the date and location of the event. All pet, auction and garage sale signs must include a phone number where the sign owner can be reached. Property owner permission must be obtained prior to locating a sign off-site.

(5)  To ensure traffic safety through the safe and orderly movement of vehicles throughout the city. 
(Prior Code, § 23-351)  
Sec. 115-3. - Compliance with chapter. 
This chapter is intended to be a supplement to the requirements and regulations of this chapter working in conjunction with other city ordinances. This chapter attempts to better define the requirements of the subdivision process, and the review of and construction of public facilities. 
(Prior Code, § 23-353)  
Sec. 115-4. - Exceptions to the subdivision regulations.

(2)  The existence of an alternative design that will meet the spirit and intent of the standards and requirements set forth in this chapter, by providing orderly subdivision of land and providing public facilities. 
a.  Provide for the orderly subdivision of land. The city may require the development to be processed as a planned unit development if the complexity and interrelated design of the development more appropriately meets the intent of the PUD process. The PUD process shall provide flexibility to review the exception as a part of a creative and imaginative development design tailored to each unique site and surround areas; 
b.  Provide public facilities that will benefit the public without detriment to surrounding property owners or the city's ability to provide services and maintain public facilities; and

If a subdivider requests an exception under this article, the preliminary plat shall, whenever possible, indicate the exceptions outlined in the application and shall be reviewed and approved per article III of chapter 101, prior to consideration of the final plat. Exception requests that are considered after final plat may trigger the need to amend previously approve plans such as the preliminary and final plat or the memorandum of agreement for public improvements. Subdivision exceptions are allowed to be processed concurrent with planned unit development applications. 
(e)  Administrative exceptions for street design standards. The city's street superintendent may grant administrative approval for deviations from the city public improvements design standards and construction specifications, adopted by this chapter, for public streets based upon the following criteria:

(b)  In the event approval of the final plat is requested prior to the installation of improvements, the developer shall agree to construct and complete the required improvements and utilities one year from the recording of the plat. The developer shall be required to furnish performance security for an amount not less than 110 percent of the estimated cost of the improvements determined by the engineer of recorded and subject to approval by the city. All forms of performance security must be provided for a minimum term of two years and shall be subject to approval by the city attorney of the city. Extension of the one year installation requirement and renewal of said securities may be made upon the approval of the city council for an additional period of time, provided application for renewal is made at least 30 days prior to the expiration date. In the event the improvements and utilities are not completed within the time allowed, the city shall enforce the performance security by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies, collect the same, and complete the required improvements on behalf of the city.

Sec. 115-79. - Bonding. 
(a)  Upon receiving approval of the preliminary plat and construction plans, which shall be effective for a period of one year, unless extended by the city council, the developer may proceed to install all required improvements and, for this purpose, may secure from the appropriate authorities the necessary permits; provided, however, that the developer, at his option and immediately following tentative approval of the preliminary plat may request approval of the final plat. In the event approval of the final plat is requested prior to installation of improvements, the developer shall agree to construct and complete the required improvements and utilities one year from the recording of the plat. The developer shall be required to furnish an escrow secured with cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited with the city or a performance bond guaranteeing actual construction and installation of the improvements and utilities in accordance with the agreement, issued by corporate sureties engaged in the business of signing bonds in the state, approved by the city attorney. The amount of the bond shall not be less than the estimated cost of the improvements determined by the city engineer or the amount of a firm bid for the completion by a contractor approved by the city, whichever is less. Renewal of the bond may be made upon the approval of the city council for an additional period of time specified by the city council, provided application for renewal is made at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of said bond. In the event the improvements and utilities are not completed within the time allowed, the city shall enforce the bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies, collect the same, and complete the required improvements on behalf of the city. 
(b)  Acceptance of bonding for a development allows for the recordation of the final plat and subsequently the release of building permits, however, occupancy will not be allowed in a subdivision until all public improvements have been installed and accepted by the city.

Sec. 115-80. - Release of escrows, letters of credit or bonds. 
(a)  If a developer who has posted an escrow, or letter of credit, or bond with the city to guarantee grading and improvement of streets or installation of utilities transfers title of the subdivision property prior to full release of the escrow, letter of credit, or bond, the city shall accept a replacement escrow or letter of credit from the successor developer at the time of the property transfer, and upon receipt of the replacement escrow or letter of credit, the city, town, or village shall release the original escrow or letter of credit in full and release the prior developer from all further obligations with respect to the subdivision improvements if the successor developer assumes all of the outstanding obligations of the previous developer. The city may accept a surety bond from the successor developer at the time of the property transfer, and upon receipt of the replacement bond, the city shall release the original bond in full, and release the prior developer from all further obligations with respect to the subdivision improvements. 
(b)  Any escrow or bond amount held by the city to secure actual construction and installation on each component of the improvements or utilities shall be released within 30 days of completion of each category of improvement or utility work to be installed, minus a maximum retention of five percent which shall be released upon completion of all improvements and utility work. The city shall inspect each category of improvement or utility work within 20 business days after a request for such inspection. Any such category of improvement or utility work shall be deemed to be completed upon certification by the city that the project is complete in accordance with this article including the filing of all documentation and certifications required by the city in complete and acceptable form. The release shall be deemed effective when the escrow funds or bond amount are duly posted with the United States Postal Service or other agreed-upon delivery service or when the escrow funds or bond amount are hand delivered to an authorized person or place as specified by the owner or developer.

Sec. 115-81. - Use of public use permit and bonding procedures for construction with city-owned properties and/or rights-of-way. 
(a)  Permit. A complete set of construction plans meeting all requirements under the this subpart, technical specifications code, and all other applicable city codes must be submitted and public use permit from the city must be obtained prior to commencing construction. Before a use of public place permit is released, the city will determine a reasonable time frame in which the installation of improvements must be completed. 
(b)  Bond. All proposed improvements within city properties and/or rights-of-way shall be bid at prevailing wage. Prior to commencing work, a performance bond guaranteeing actual construction and installation of the improvements in accordance with the use of public place permit, issued by corporate sureties engaged in the business of signing bonds in the state, and approved by the city attorney must be collected by the city. The amount of the bond shall not be less than 110 percent of the estimated cost of the improvements determined by the city engineer or 110 percent of the amount of a firm bid for the completion by a contractor approved by the city, whichever is less. In the event that the improvements are not completed within the time allowed, the city shall enforce the bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies, collect the same, and complete the required improvements on behalf of the city. Upon completion and acceptance by the city, a warranty guaranteeing the improvements for a period of one year must be provided. 
(c)  Hold harmless. The city, its officers, and employees, shall be held harmless and indemnified by owner against any claims, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, and costs arising out of or resulting from the performance or nonperformance under the use of public place permit by the developer, its officers, employees or agents.

(Prior Code, § 23-359; Ord. No. 1365, 8-2005)  
Sec. 115-107. - Content of covenants and restrictions. 
The covenants and restrictions, when submitted, shall specify the ownership of the common open space and common improvements, shall be prepared in accordance with this division and RSMo ch. 448, shall provide for establishment of the condominium homeowners' or property owners' association or trust prior to the sale of any part of the property; for the method of maintenance; that open space restrictions and maintenance shall be permanent; that the homeowners property owners are liable for the payment of maintenance fees and capital assessments; that unpaid homeowners' property owners' fees and assessments will be a lien on the property of the delinquent homeowners property owners; that the association or trustee shall be responsible for liability insurance, taxes and perpetual maintenance; that membership shall be mandatory for each homeowner property owner and any successive buyer; that each homeowner property owner, at the time of purchase, shall be furnished with a copy of the approved restrictions or conditions; and that any association or trust formed to own and maintain common open space and common improvements will not be dissolved without the consent of the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall this declaration be revoked or amended with respect to the city's right to assess the lots for repair and maintenance of common areas without the prior written consent of the city, nor may the association be dissolved without the prior written consent of the city. An amendment purporting to revoke this declaration or to vary the city's rights hereunder shall be void unless the city's prior written consent is attached to such amendment. In addition, such covenants and restrictions shall provide that in the event the association fails to maintain the common areas, open space/improvements, or should be dissolved for any reason and the common areas and space/improvements are not maintained in reasonable condition, the city may enter and maintain same, and assess the costs ratably against the properties within the development that have the right to enjoy or use the common area or open space/improvements, which assessment shall constitute a lien against such properties. 
(Prior Code, § 23-360; Ord. No. 1365, 8-2005)  
Sec. 115-108. - Maintenance of common open space and common improvements. 
(a)  If the planning and zoning commission and city council determines that the public interest requires assurance concerning adequate maintenance of common open space areas and improvements, the planning and zoning commission and city council may require that the restrictive covenants, rules and bylaws creating the unit ownership shall provide that if the unit owners establish and maintain such common open space, or any successor unit owners shall at any time after establishment of the development fail to maintain the common open space/improvements in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the approved plans, the city may serve a notice in writing upon such unit owners. Said notice shall describe how the unit ownership has failed to maintain the common open space/improvements in reasonable condition, shall require that such deficiencies of maintenance be remedied within 30 days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a public hearing. Said hearing shall be held within 20 days of notice. 
(b)  Rights of the city. If the city determines that the association has failed to maintain the common areas in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plans and plat approved by the city for development of the subdivision, the city may, after notice and hearing to the developer and the board, take such corrective or remedial action as may be necessary to adequately maintain or repair the common areas and assess the costs against the owners ratably which shall be a lien on each lot. 
(c)  At such hearing, the city council may modify the terms of the original notice concerning the deficiencies and may grant an extension of time to remedy these deficiencies. 
(d)  If said deficiencies are not corrected, the city may enter upon said common open space and maintain the same for one year in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the development and to prevent the common open space/improvement from becoming a public nuisance. 
(e)  Said entry and maintenance shall not grant the public any rights to use the common open space/improvements unless the owners voluntarily dedicate the same to the public and such dedication is accepted by the city. 
(f)  Before the expiration of said one-year period and upon its initiative or upon the request of the unit owners theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the common open space/improvements, the city council shall call a public hearing upon notice in writing to such organization or to owners of the unit ownership. At said hearing, the unit owners shall show cause why such maintenance by the city shall not, at the election of the city council, continue for a succeeding one-year period. 
(g)  If the city council determines that said unit ownership is ready and able to maintain the common open space/improvements in reasonable condition, the city shall cease to maintain the common open space/improvements at the end of said one-year period or at an earlier date prescribed by the city council. If the city council determines that such organization is not ready and able to maintain the common open space/improvements in a reasonable condition, the city council may, at its discretion, continue to maintain the common open space improvements during the next succeeding year, subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year thereafter. 
(h)  The rules and bylaws creating the unit ownership shall further provide that the cost of such maintenance by the city shall be assessed ratably against the individual properties within the development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space/improvements. This assessment shall become a charge on said properties, and such charge shall be paid by the owners of said properties within 30 days after receipt of same. Such assessments shall constitute a lien against all properties within the unit ownership. 
(Prior Code, § 23-360A; Ord. No. 1365, 8-2005)  
Sec. 115-109. - Maintenance responsibility. 
(a)  Except as provided in this division, the city shall not be responsible for the maintenance of any common open space/improvements required by this chapter. 
(b)  Initial maintenance of the common open space/improvements within a development shall be the responsibility of the developer. The restrictive covenants, rules and bylaws of the unit ownership may prescribe a method for transfer of maintenance responsibility to a duly constituted property owners' association. In the event no method for transfer or maintenance responsibility is prescribed, the developer shall retain this responsibility until 50 percent of the development has been sold, the established homeowners association or trust unit organization, comprised of the development's unit owners shall be deeded the common open space/improvements and such owners shall become fully responsible for its maintenance and upkeep. 
(c)  The maintenance responsibilities of the developer listed in this division shall be specifically indicated in a letter of agreement between the developer and the city. The developer shall submit said letter to the planning and zoning commission director of planning and development at the time of final plat review. All principal access shall be from an arterial highway or street and no truck traffic shall be routed through any adjacent residential areas. Streets through adjacent residential areas shall not be used to provide principal access for truck traffic to any nonresidential use in this district except on streets classified as expressways, arterials or collectors.

DIVISION 3. - DESIGN PRINCIPLES 
 
Sec. 115-132. - Construction standards. 
All construction of public improvements and public streets shall conform to the applicable city public improvements design standards and specifications. 
(Prior Code, § 23-361)  
Sec. 115-133. - Consideration of existing conditions. 
The city realizes that existing conditions of an area considered for development plays a role in the development potential of the property. These factors will be given consideration during the review of the proposal. Within the established framework of local streets, consideration shall be given to provide for the uniformity of street widths and for proper alignments and street names. In residential areas, the preservation of privacy and safety of the subdivision will be a consideration in the prevention of through traffic in an area. Street design shall be directly related to the traffic-generating uses of abutting land. The number of intersections on streets and highways shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersection design must provide for the greatest safety both for pedestrians and motorists. This will be accomplished through the consideration of dangers associated with site distance and proximity to existing intersections. The topography of the land shall be respected and streets shall be designed to minimize excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. Problems of drainage must be adequately addressed to ensure occupants of a subdivision security from any potential flooding. 
In circumstances where development is proposed adjacent to an existing street with a classification of collector or greater; a traffic impact study shall be performed at the time of development. The traffic impact study shall be performed by a traffic engineer registered in the State of Missouri. The traffic impact study shall address the impact of the proposed development on the adjacent street system, including but not limited to, vehicular circulation, vehicular volume, site distance, and ingress/egress to the proposed development. The traffic impact study shall be submitted to the City of Nixa for review and approval as part of the construction document review process. 
(Prior Code, § 23-362; Ord. No. 1900, 3-21-2016)  
Sec. 115-134. - Determination of public street or private driveway. 
(a)  All accessways functioning as streets in terms of public access and provisions of public services shall be shown on the plat and constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications provided in this chapter and the technical specifications manual. 
(b)  When designation of public or private access is unclear, the city shall apply the following criteria to a particular situation to determine if a proposed accessway shall be a public street or private driveway. 
(1)  Driveways are generally non-through; they are not to provide easy, convenient connection between streets that encourages use by the general public. 
(2)  Driveways generally serve one lot, not several lots capable of being held in separate ownership. Accessways that provide the only or the primary access from the street to a use by crossing other lots can require public access. Public access is better served via a public street. 
(3)  Public services are generally provided on streets, not private drives. In a situation where a driveway's design makes it difficult for the city to provide its services in a standard fashion, or makes it difficult for residents to utilize the standard public services, and where the difficulty can be eliminated by utilizing a street instead of a driveway, a street is appropriate. 
(4)  Unless the city determines that it is in the best interest of the city to do otherwise, the publicly owned and maintained portions of the water and sewer systems are constructed within the street ROW; instillation of these services beyond the right-of-way (in a driveway) shall be maintained by the landowner. 
(c)  If an applicant does not agree with staff interpretation of this section, an appeal may be made to the planning and zoning commission. 
(Prior Code, § 23-363)  
Sec. 115-135. - Access to streets. 
All lots created by the subdivision of land shall abut a public street conforming to the standards set forth in article VII of chapter 117 except as allowed in section 115-172. 
(Prior Code, § 23-364)  
Sec. 115-136. - Two means of access. 
(a)  Two means of access connecting with a public street shall be provided to ensure public safety by providing an efficient transportation system for ingress and egress from a subdivision. The two access points shall connect with the public street system. 
(b)  Consideration will be given if it can be shown that compliance with this section is not possible due to land constraints. A limited number of lots, acreage, or an unusually shaped piece of property that cannot reasonably be served by more than a single access point will be considered. If it is determined that a single access is all that the property will accommodate, it must be shown that the single access will meet the public safety and transportation needs of the subdivision. 
(c)  When it has been determined that two means of access is impracticable for development, it may be necessary for emergency purposes to provide an emergency access. This alternative access shall be required if it is determined that the number of units proposed and the nature of the development warrants the emergency access. The alternative access shall be designed to accommodate the ingress and egress of necessary emergency vehicles as determined by the city chief of police and the fire district chief. 
(d)  Developments that are constructed in phases shall, in the initial phase, construct both means of access. If land constraints prohibit the construction of both access's with the initial phase, the developer may post financial security in the amount of 100 percent of the cost of constructing the second access pursuant to section 115-79. 
(Prior Code, § 23-365)  
Sec. 115-137. - Lot standards. 
The following standards are to be used during the design stage of a proposed subdivision to ensure proper size, shape and orientation of lots: 
(1)  The minimum area and dimensions of proposed lots shall meet the requirements of article VIII of chapter 117. Planned unit developments (PUD) shall comply with the standards set forth in the PUD regulations. 
(2)  For lots located on cul-de-sac bulbs, the street frontage requirements of the zoned district shall not apply at the ROW line. The street frontage requirement shall be measured at the setback line to ensure lots of sufficient size to accommodate a structure comparable to other lots within the subdivision. 
(3)  Corner lots established in residential districts shall be platted wider than interior lots to accommodate the required side yard setback. 
(4)  At a minimum, cul-de-sac lots shall have 35 feet of frontage on the adjacent public street. 
(5)  The creation of lots with front and rear street frontages shall be avoided. In circumstances where it is unavoidable, houses must front the lesser traveled of the two public streets. When the lesser traveled road cannot be determined, the first structure constructed will determine the frontage street for the remainder of the lots. 
(6)  All detention facilities designed to serve only one subdivision shall be platted as a part of an individual lots with all maintenance and upkeep required by the individual lot owner who purchases that lot. Regional detention facilities designed to serve more than one subdivision shall be dedicated to the city with all maintenance performed by the city. In instances where detention facilities are incorporated into subdivision's open space as an amenity package, a homeowners' association will be responsible for the maintenance needs. 
(7)  The minimum lot size shall apply to the usable portion of the lot only. Lots containing detention basins shall not include the portion of the lot dedicated for drainage purposes to satisfy the minimum lot size requirements of article VII of chapter 117. 
(8)  A lot depth in excess of 2½ times the width shall be avoided. 
(9)  Easements shall be provided where necessary for utilities, drainage, or other public purposes. 
(10)  No lot shall be divided by a city boundary line. 
(Prior Code, § 23-366)  
Sec. 115-138. - Buildable lots. 
All lots created through the subdivision process shall be developable and shall conform to the minimum standards as set forth in this chapter. No subdivision of land shall create lots that prohibit development due to steepness of terrain, natural physical conditions or other existing conditions. 
(Prior Code, § 23-367)  
Sec. 115-139. - Ditch improvements. 
The city may require stormwater conveyance systems to either be concrete lined or piped in a proposed subdivision if necessary to promote public safety and welfare.

Secs. 115-140115-161. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 4. - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
Sec. 115-162. - Street classification. 
(a)  In all new subdivisions, streets that are dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
(1)  The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day (ADT); 
(2)  The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a good indicator of the number of trips but is not always conclusive; 
(3)  Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision. 
(b)  The classification of streets shall be as follows: 
(1)  Local. A street primarily providing direct access to abutting properties and designed to accommodate low volume, low-speed traffic. The design service volume for local streets is less than 1,500 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 mph. 
(2)  Collectors. A street which collects and distributes traffic between arterial streets and local streets and is primarily intended to proved for low-to-moderate volume, low-speed, and short length trips while also providing access to abutting properties. The design service volume for collector streets is 1,500 to 8,000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 mph. 
(3)  Secondary arterial. A street which collects and distributes traffic between arterial streets and local streets and is primarily intended to provide for low-to moderate volume, low-speed, an short length trips while also providing access to abutting properties. The design service volume for collector streets is 1,500 to 8,000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 mph. 
(4)  Primary arterial. A street primarily intended to provide for high-to-moderate volume, moderate-speed traffic movement between major activity centers. Access to abutting property is subordinate to traffic flow and is subject to the necessary control of entrances and exits. The design service volume for primary arterial streets is 10,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 35 to 45 mph. 
(5)  Expressway. A street primarily intended to provide partial access control and high priority for traffic flow with at-grade signalized intersections for major streets. Intended for high-volume, moderate-to-high speed traffic movement across the metropolitan area with minimal access to adjacent land. May be designed as a highway with separation for adjacent land uses or as a street with controlled access to adjacent land uses. Service access should be provided from lower order streets. The design service volume for expressways is 20,000 to 50,000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 to 55 mph. 
(Prior Code, § 23-271)  
Sec. 115-163. - Access to lots. 
Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use. 
(Prior Code, § 23-272)  
Sec. 115-164. - Access to arterial streets. 
Whenever a major subdivision that involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided from the lots within this subdivision onto this street. 
(Prior Code, § 23-273)  
Sec. 115-165. - Entrances to streets. 
(a)  All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the city's planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that: 
(1)  Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in abutting streets; and 
(2)  Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized. 
(b)  Specifications for driveway entrances are set forth in the city technical specifications manual. If driveway entrances and other openings onto streets are constructed in accordance with the foregoing specifications and requirements, this shall be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  For purposes of this section, the term "prima facie evidence" means that the permit-issuing authority may (but is not required to) conclude from this evidence alone that the proposed development complies with subsection (a) of this section. 
(Prior Code, § 23-274)  
Sec. 115-166. - Coordination with surrounding streets. 
(a)  The street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing, proposed, and anticipated streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion of a single tract that is being divided into lots (hereinafter, "surrounding streets") as provided in this section. 
(b)  Collector streets shall interest with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and convenient locations. 
(c)  Local streets shall connect with surrounding streets where necessary to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons, but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic. 
(d)  Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, no temporary dead-end street in excess of 1,000 feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is available. 
(Prior Code, § 23-275)  
Sec. 115-167. - Relationship of street to topography. 
(a)  Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and stormwater run-off objectives set forth in the technical specifications manual, and street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography. 
(b)  As indicated in section 115-169, the maximum grade at any point on a street constructed without a curb and gutter shall be six percent. On streets constructed with a curb and gutter the grade shall not exceed 12 percent unless no other practicable alternative is available. However, in no case may streets be constructed with grades that, in the professional opinion of the public works director, create a substantial danger to the public safety. 
(Prior Code, § 23-276)  
Sec. 115-168. - Street width, sidewalk, and drainage requirements in subdivisions. 
(a)  Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: 
(1)  To carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; 
(2)  To provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and 
(3)  To serve as an important link in the town's drainage system. 
In order to fulfill these objectives, all public streets shall be constructed to meet either the standards set forth in subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section. 
(b)  All streets shall be constructed with curb and gutter and shall conform to the other requirements of this subsection. Only standard 90-degree curb may be used, except that roll-type curb shall be permitted along minor and local streets within residential subdivisions. Street pavement width shall be measured from curb face to curb face where 90-degree curb is used, and from the center of the curb where roll-type curb is used. Local street designations shall have a minimum street width of 27 feet from back of curb to back of curb with parking allowed on one side of the street only. Local streets requesting parking on both sided of the street shall maintain a minimum street width of 30 feet measured from the back of curb to the back of curb. 
Street Type 	Minimum Right-of-Way

Secondary Arterial 	80 	68 	Both sides 
Primary Arterial 	110 	68 	Both sides 
Expressway 	180 		
 
(c)  The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least four feet in width, except that the permit-issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials when it concludes that: 
(1)  Such walkways would serve the residents of the development as adequately as concrete sidewalks; and 
(2)  Such walkways would be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the overall design of the development. 
(d)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from the subdivision to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet in width to provide such access. 
(Prior Code, § 23-277)  
Sec. 115-169. - General layout of streets. 
(a)  Local streets in residential areas shall be curved whenever practicable to the extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot appearance. 
(b)  Cul-de-sacs and loop streets are encouraged so that through traffic on residential streets is minimized. Similarly, to the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets shall be minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards. 
(c)  All permanent dead-end streets (as opposed to temporary dead-end streets, see section 115-166(d)) shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in accordance with the standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section. Except where no other practical alternative is available, such streets may not extend more than 550 feet (measured to the center of the turnaround). 
(d)  The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a radius of 50 feet. The radius of the paved portion of the turnaround (measured to the outer edge of the pavement) shall be 40 feet, and the pavement width shall be 12 feet without curb and gutter or 18 feet with curb and gutter. The unpaved center of the turnaround area shall be landscaped. 
(Prior Code, § 23-278)  
Sec. 115-170. - Street intersections. 
(a)  Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no two streets may intersect at less than 60 degrees. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless the street superintendent certified to the permit-issuing authority that such an inspection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety. 
(b)  Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets shall not be less than 125 feet. 
(c)  Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet. 
(Prior Code, § 23-279)  
Sec. 115-171. - Construction standards and specifications. 
Construction and design standards and specifications for streets, sidewalks, and curbs and gutters are contained in the technical specifications manual, and all such facilities shall be completed in accordance with these standards. 
(Prior Code, § 23-280)  
Sec. 115-172. - Public streets and private roads in subdivisions. 
(a)  All lots created after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access requirement set forth in section 115-163. For purposes of this subsection, the term "public street" includes a preexisting public street as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets the public street standards of this chapter and is dedicated for public use. Unless the recorded plat of a subdivision clearly shows a street to be private, the recording of such a plat shall constitute an offer of dedication of such street. 
(b)  A subdivision in which the access requirement of section 115-163 is satisfied by a private road that meets neither the public street standards nor the standards set forth in section 115-163 may be developed so long as, since the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, not more than three lots have been created out of that same tract. 
(1)  The intent of this subsection is primarily to allow the creation of not more than three lots developed for single-family residential purposes. Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may not approve any subdivision served by a private road authorized by this subsection in which one or more of the lots thereby created is intended for: 
a.  Two-family or multifamily residential use; or 
b.  Any other residential or nonresidential use that would tend to generate more traffic than that customarily generated by three single-family residences. 
(2)  To ensure that the intent of this subsection is not subverted, the permit-issuing authority may, among other possible options, require that the approved plans show the types and locations of buildings on each lot or that the lots in a residential subdivision served by a private road be smaller than the permissible size of lots on which two-family or multifamily developments could be located or that restrictive covenants limiting the use of the subdivided property in accordance with this section be recorded before final approval. 
(c)  No final plat that shows lots served by private roads may be recorded unless the final plat contains the following notations: 
(1)  "Further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private road may be prohibited by the city of Nixa Land Development Ordinance." 
(2)  "The policy of the City of Nixa is that, if the city improves the streets (i) that were never constructed to the standards required in the Land Development Ordinance for dedicated streets, and (ii) on which 75 percent of the dwelling units were constructed after the effective date of this chapter, then 100 percent of the costs of such improvements shall be assessed to abutting landowners." 
(d)  The recorded plat of any subdivision that includes a private road shall clearly state that such road is a private road. Further, the initial purchaser of a newly created lot served by a private road shall be furnished by the seller with a disclosure statement outlining the maintenance responsibilities for the road. 
(Prior Code, § 23-281)  
Sec. 115-173. - Attention to handicapped in street and sidewalk construction. 
Whenever curb and gutter construction is used on public streets, wheelchair ramps for the handicapped shall be provided at intersections and other major points of pedestrian flow. Wheelchair ramps and depressed curbs shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards. 
(Prior Code, § 23-282)  
Sec. 115-174. - Street names and house numbers. 
(a)  Street names shall be assigned by the developer subject to the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Proposed streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. Newly created streets shall be given names that neither duplicate nor are phonetically similar to existing streets within the Nixa Area E911 District, regardless of the use of different suffixes (such as those set forth in subsection (b) of this section). 
(b)  Street names shall include a suffix such as the following: 
(1)  Circle. A short street that returns to itself. 
(2)  Court or place. A cul-de-sac or dead-end street. 
(3)  Loop. A street that begins at the intersection with one street and circles back to end at another intersection with the same street. 
(4)  Street. All public streets not designated by another suffix. 
(c)  Building numbers shall be assigned by the city. 
(Prior Code, § 23-283)  
Sec. 115-175. - Bridges. 
All bridges shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the state highway and transportation department, except those bridges on roads not intended for public dedication may be approved if designed by a licensed architect or engineer. 
(Prior Code, § 23-284)  
Sec. 115-176. - Utilities. 
Utilities installed in public rights-of-way or along private roads shall conform to the requirements set forth in chapter 22, utilities.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 117-1. - Regulations generally. 
Except as hereinafter specifically provided: 
(1)  No land shall be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2)  No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, nor shall any building be used, except for a use permitted in the district in which such building is located, or to exceed the height limit herein established for the district in which such building is located, except in conformance with the off-street parking and loading regulations of the district in which such building is located, and in no case shall there be more than one main building on one lot except as specifically provided hereinafter. 
(3)  The minimum yards, parking spaces, and open spaces, including lot area per family, required by this chapter for each and every building existing at the time of passage of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be encroached upon or considered as part of the yard or parking space or open space required for any other building, nor shall any lot area be reduced below the requirements of this chapter for the district in which such lot is located. 
(Prior Code, § 23-10)  
Sec. 117-2. - Lots divided by district lines. 
(a)  Whenever a single lot two acres or less in size is located within two or more different zoning districts, the district regulations applicable to the district within which the larger portion of the lot lies shall apply to the entire lot.

Secs. 117-3117-22. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE II. - ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
Sec. 117-23. - Residential districts established. 
The following residential districts are hereby established: AG, R-1, R-4, R-3, and R-5. Each of these districts is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in nonresidential districts. Other objectives of some of these districts are explained in the remainder of this section. 
(1)  The Agricultural (AG) District is designed to accommodate single-family residential development areas in the city limits that are not yet served by public water or sewer facilities and that are not yet appropriate for development at higher densities. Once public water and sewer facilities have been made available, residences in this district will be able to hook on by following the requirements. This area is also more suitable for uses that would have a negative impact on more dense residential areas. Mobile home parks are permissible in this district with a special use permit. 
(2)  The R-1 district is designed primarily to accommodate single-family detached residential uses (other than mobile homes) at lower densities in areas served by public water and sewer facilities. The R-1 zone districts have a minimum lot size requirement of 6,600 square feet. 
(3)  The R-4 district is designed to accommodate single-family attached (patio homes with zero lot lines) and two-family. Multifamily uses can occur only in the form of planned residential or planned unit developments. The "4" stands for 4,000 square feet minimum lot size per family. 
(4)  The R-3 district is designed primarily to accommodate higher density multifamily developments. Single-family attached and two-family uses can occur only in the form of planned residential or planned unit developments. The "3" stands for 3,000 square feet minimum lot size per family. 
(5)  The R-5 district is designed primarily to accommodate medium density multifamily townhouse developments. Single-family attached and two-family uses can occur only in the form of planned residential or planned unit developments. The "5" stands for 5,000 square feet minimum lot size per family. 
(Prior Code, § 23-146)  
Sec. 117-24. - Commercial districts established. 
(a)  The following commercial districts are hereby established: CC, NC, O, GC, and HC. These districts are created to accomplish the purposes and serve the objectives set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The City Center (CC) District is designed to accommodate a wide variety of commercial activities (particularly those that are pedestrian oriented) that will result in the most intensive and attractive use of the city's central business district. 
(c)  The Neighborhood Commercial (NC) District is designed to accommodate commercial development on a scale that is less intensive than the permitted CC district. A lesser intensity of development is achieved through setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements that are more restrictive than those applicable to the CC zone. The NC district may provide a transition in some areas of the city. 
(d)  The Transitional Office (O) District is designed to accommodate a mixture of uses (office, clerical, research, services, etc.). It is intended that this zoning classification be applied primarily in areas that no longer are viable as single-family residential areas because of high traffic volumes on adjacent streets or because of other market factors but remain viable as locations for office oriented developments. Such areas will also generally constitute transition or buffer zones between major arterials or more intensively developed commercial areas and residential districts. 
(e)  The General Commercial (GC) District is designed to accommodate the widest range of commercial activities. 
(f)  The Highway Commercial (HC) District is designed to accommodate commercial activities that draw business primarily from and provide services primarily to the U.S. Highway 160 and Missouri Highway 14 corridor. 
(Prior Code, § 23-147)  
Sec. 117-25. - Regional commercial overlay districts established. 
(a)  The purpose of this district is to provide for the development of large-scale integrated retail shopping on a large site with convenient highway access. The Regional Commercial Overlay District is established as a special district which overlays the HC (Highway Commercial) zoned district. 
(b)  The provisions of this section are designed to ensure that all development activities associated with a regional shopping district will be carried out so as to provide for and maintain: 
(1)  Protection of neighboring properties against harmful effects of uses on the development site; 
(2)  Convenient and safe access for firefighting and emergency rescue vehicles within the development site and in relation to adjacent streets; 
(3)  Convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the development site and in relation to adjacent streets, properties or improvements; 
(4)  Satisfactory methods of stormwater management as provided in the city's technical specifications; 
(5)  Convenience and safety of off-street loading and unloading of vehicles, goods, products, materials and equipment for the operation of the establishments on the development site; 
(6)  Adequate off-street parking and traffic mitigation measures that will enhance the efficiency of the transportation system as provided in article V of chapter 111; 
(7)  Attractive and functional design with due regard to the existing conditions of the development site and the use thereof for a regional shopping center, in order to promote the interests of the city. 
(c)  Relationship to underlying districts and regulations. 
(1)  The Regional Commercial Overlay District shall overlay the HC (Highway Commercial) zoned district so that any parcel of land lying in a Regional Commercial Overlay District shall also lie in the zoning district in which it is otherwise classified by this chapter. 
(2)  All regulations of the underlying zoning district shall apply within the Regional Commercial Overlay District to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the specific provisions of section 117-4(a). To the extent the provisions of this section are in conflict with or are inconsistent with other provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall govern and prevail even if such other provisions are more restrictive than those set forth in section 117-4(a). 
(d)  Regional Commercial Overlay District development regulations. Land located within the Regional Commercial Overlay District shall be subject to the dimensional controls set forth below: 
(1)  Minimum area of overlay district: 20 acres. 
(2)  Minimum lot size (individual building lots): none. 
(3)  Minimum side, front and rear yards (other than at the perimeter of the defined district boundaries): none. 
(4)  Minimum side, front and rear yard setback (at the perimeter of the defined district boundaries): 15 feet. 
(e)  Permitted uses. 
(1)  The Regional Commercial Overlay District is provided to accommodate a concentration of retail stores and entertainment service establishments, including restaurants, movie theaters and such other uses as are customarily found in a regional commercial service sector setting. 
(2)  Regional commercial overlay districts may be subdivided into multiple lots, however, at a minimum one lot shall be developed as a retail facility having a minimum gross square footage of not less than 40,000 square feet under single occupancy. 
(3)  No more than 25 percent of the total gross leasable area of all buildings located within the district shall be devoted to uses other than retail stores and entertainment service establishments. 
(f)  Application of requirements. 
(1)  A regional commercial overlay district may consist of more than a single building lot, and in such event the requirements of this subpart pertaining to parking, landscaping and signage shall not be applied to individual building lots, but shall be applied to the entire district as if the development area were a single building lot notwithstanding the fact that the building lots with the district area may be in different ownership. 
(2)  The Regional Commercial Overlay District may be developed in phases and may be developed and occupied under one or more building permits and occupancy permits. 
(Ord. No. 1723, § 23-147.1, 1-17-2012)  
Sec. 117-26. - Manufacturing districts established. 
(a)  The following districts are hereby established primarily to accommodate enterprises engaged in the manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing, renovating, painting, cleaning, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment: M-1 and M-2. 
(b)  The performance standards set forth in division 1 of article VIII of this chapter place limitations on the characteristics of uses located in these districts. The limitations in the M-1 district are more restrictive than those in the M-2 district.

ARTICLE III. - ZONING MAP 
 
Sec. 117-56. - Official zoning map. 
(a)  There shall be a map known and designated as the official zoning map, which shall show all the boundaries of all zoning districts within the city limits. This map shall be kept in the development department. 
(b)  The official zoning map dated May 8, 2006, is adopted and incorporated herein by reference. Amendments to this map shall be made and posted in accordance with section 1173-157. 
(c)  Should the official zoning map be lost, destroyed, or damaged, the city planner may have a new map drawn. No further city council authorization or action is required so long as no district boundaries are changed in this process. 
(Prior Code, § 23-156; Ord. No. 1421, 5-2006)  
Sec. 117-57. - Amendments to the official zoning map. 
(a)  Amendments to the official zoning map are accomplished using the same procedures that apply to other amendments to this chapter, as set forth in article VII of chapter 101. 
(b)  The city planner shall update the official zoning map as soon as possible after amendments to it are adopted by the city council. Upon entering any such amendment on the map, the city planner shall change the date of the map to indicate its latest revision. 
(c)  No unauthorized person may alter or modify the official zoning map.

Secs. 117-59117-89. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE IV. - APPROVED USES 
 
Sec. 117-90. - Table of approved uses. 
The table of approved uses (see section 117-99) should be read in close conjunction with the definitions of terms set forth in section 101-2 and the other interpretative provisions set forth in this article. 
(Prior Code, § 23-161)  
Sec. 117-91. - Use of the designations "X," or "S" in table of approved uses. 
Subject to section 117-92, when used in connection with a particular use in the table of approved uses (section 117-99), the letter "X" means that the use meets the requirements of the zoning district and is approved by being eligible for a building permit issued by the development department. The letter "S" means a special-use permit must be obtained from the city council. 
(Prior Code, § 23-162)  
Sec. 117-92. - City council jurisdiction over use otherwise approved with an approved use permit. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the table of approved uses (interpreted in the light of section 117-91 and the other provisions of this article) provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permitted with an approved use permit, a special-use permit shall nevertheless be required if the city planner finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. 
(b)  In making this determination, the city planner shall consider, among other factors, whether: 
(1)  The use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot; 
(2)  Whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another; 
(3)  Whether the use proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties; and 
(4)  Whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are approved on the zoning district in question. 
(c)  The special-use permit request must be heard and determined by the city council in a regularly scheduled meeting. 
(Prior Code, § 23-163)  
Sec. 117-93. - Approved uses and specific exclusions. 
(a)  The presumption established by this chapter is that all legitimate uses of land are approved within at least one zoning district in the city limits. Therefore, because the list of approved uses set for in section 117-99 (table of approved uses) cannot be all inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses. 
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, all uses that are not listed in section 117-90 (table of approved uses), even given the liberal interpretation mandated by subsection (a) of this section, are prohibited. Nor shall section 117-99 (table of approved uses) be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is approved in other zoning districts. 
(c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts: 
(1)  Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the city's fire prevention code. 
(2)  Stockyards, slaughterhouses, and rendering plants. 
(3)  Use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence. (Situations that do not comply with this subdivision on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are required to conform within one year. See section 101-266.) 
(4)  Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold or stored, any services are performed, or other business is conducted. (Situations that do not comply with this subdivision on the effective date of this chapter are required to conform within 90 days. See section 101-266.) 
(Prior Code, § 23-164)  
Sec. 117-94. - Accessory uses. 
(a)  The table of approved uses (section 117-99) classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use: 
(1)  Constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot; or 
(2)  Is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it. 
then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried beneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. 
(b)  For purposes of interpreting subsection (a) of this section: 
(1)  A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use; 
(2)  To be "commonly associated" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness. 
(c)  Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the following activities, so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above, are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses: 
(1)  Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation. 
(2)  Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature. 
(3)  The renting out of one or two rooms within a single-family residence (neither of which constitute a separate dwelling unit) to not more than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling. 
(4)  Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three days (whether consecutive or not). Only two yard sales per year not including the city-wide garage sale event. 
(Prior Code, § 23-165)  
Sec. 117-95. - Home occupations. 
(a)  A home occupation is that accessory use of a dwelling unit that shall constitute either entirely or partly the livelihood of a person living in the dwelling, subject to the following: No home occupation shall be permitted that: 
(1)  Changes the outside appearance of the dwelling or is visible from the street; 
(2)  Generates traffic, parking, sewerage or water use in excess of what is normal in the residential neighborhood; 
(3)  Creates a hazard to person or property, results in electrical interference or becomes a nuisance; 
(4)  Results in outside storage or display of anything. 
(b)  The following are permitted home occupations, provided they do not violate any of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section: 
(1)  Dressmaking, sewing, and tailoring; 
(2)  Painting, sculpturing or writing; 
(3)  Telephone answering; 
(4)  Home crafts, such as model making, rug weaving, lapidary work and cabinet making; 
(5)  Tutoring, limited to four students at a time; 
(6)  Home cooking and preserving; 
(7)  Office uses, such as computer programming, telemarketing, desktop publishing; 
(8)  Barbershops and beauty parlors with only one chair; 
(c)  The following are prohibited as home occupations: 
(1)  Barbershops and beauty parlors with more than one chair; 
(2)  Animal hospitals; 
(3)  Dancing studios; 
(4)  Mortuaries; 
(5)  Nursery schools; 
(6)  Private clubs; 
(7)  Repair shops; 
(8)  Restaurants; 
(9)  Stables or kennels; 
(10)  Tourist homes; 
(11)  Automobile repair or paint shops. 
(d)  Any proposed home occupation that is neither specifically permitted or prohibited by subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall be considered a special-use and be granted or denied by the city council based upon considerations of those standards listed in subsection (a) of this section and issued in accordance with section 101-141. 
(Prior Code, § 23-166)  
Sec. 117-96. - Approved uses not requiring permits. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no approved use permit, special-use permit, or preliminary plat approval is necessary for the following uses: 
(1)  Streets. 
(2)  Electric power, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way. 
(3)  Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the permission of the owner (state or town) of the right-of-way. 
(Prior Code, § 23-167)  
Sec. 117-97. - Change in use. 
(a)  A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever: 
(1)  The change involves a change from one principal use category to another. 
(2)  If the original use is a planned unit development, the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the planned unit development use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered. 
(3)  If the original use is a planned unit development use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses comprise the planned unit development use changes. 
(4)  If the original use is a planned residential development, the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change. 
(5)  If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that business consists of one individual use), that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business may be classified under the same principal use as the previous business). 
(b)  A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned. 
(c)  A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use. 
(Prior Code, § 23-168)  
Sec. 117-98. - More specific use controls. 
Whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the table of approved uses (section 117-99), the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls.

ARTICLE VI. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 117-212. - Purpose. 
(a)  The planned unit development (PUD) procedures provides the property owner/developer with a more flexible means to develop land, to use a more innovative design, while assuring greater bona-fide benefits to the community. Its intent is to encourage a freer and more imaginative design than is possible under the conventional zoning regulations by eliminating minimum lot sizes, setbacks, and other zoning and subdivision related restrictions. 
(b)  The information in this article is intended to assist the developer in achieving compliance with the PUD procedures prior to incurring costs of complete design, while providing the city with the assurance that the project will retain the character presented at the time of acceptance. The following reflects the city's PUD objectives: 
(1)  To stimulate a creative approach to designing residential, commercial and industrial land use developments. 
(2)  To provide a means to use land more efficiently. 
(3)  To preserve and integrate, to the greatest extent possible, the existing natural landscape features, (e.g., trees, streams, and topography). 
(4)  To accommodate more usable and suitably located private or public recreational facilities than would otherwise be provided under conventional zoning regulations. 
(5)  To encourage a greater diversification and mixture of land uses, in order to facilitate self-sustainability of the development, architecturally integrated structures and passive and active recreational open space areas. 
(Prior Code, § 23-196)  
Sec. 117-213. - PUD zoning. 
(a)  The PUD zoning district may be established through initial zoning at the time of annexation, rezoned at the time of development, or as an overlay to the approved underlying zone district. The establishment of the three types of PUDs allows for the applicant to cater a PUD application to the specific needs of the development. The three types of PUDs outlined in this article are Planned Unit Development Residential (PUD-R), Planned Unit Development Commercial (PUD-C), Planned Unit Development Industrial (PUD-I) and Planned Unit Development Mixed Use (PUD-MU). 
(b)  The following classifications of the planned unit development shall be used as an overlay or requires rezoning where consistent with the city plan or applicable zoning: 
	Overlay in City 	Rezone in City 	New Zone 
Annexation 
PUD-R 	Yes 	No 	Yes 
PUD-C 	Yes 	No 	Yes 
PUD-I 	Yes 	No 	Yes 
PUD-MU 	No 	Yes 	Yes 
 
(Prior Code, § 23-197)  
Sec. 117-214. - Permitted uses. 
Principal permitted use and, subject to appropriate criteria, conditional uses and accessory uses of the underlying zone district are allowed within a PUD. Restrictions, controls, and incentives of the applicable PUD development proposal shall be included within the PUD application prior to recordation. 
(1)  PUD-R, Planned Unit Development Residential District: 
a.  Intent. The intent of the PUD-R district is to support private residential development by providing incentives encouraging the use of innovative design techniques in order to achieve high-quality residential development. 
b.  Size. There is no minimum lot size for the PUD-R district; however, it must be large enough to enable its development as a complete identifiable unit and through the flexibility allowed by the PUD process provide a bona-fide benefit to the residents and users of the PUD. Recommended minimum lot size for a detached single-family residential lot is 6,600 square feet with the provision that 20 percent of the total site is developed as common open space area. 
c.  Permitted uses. For the PUD-R, the following uses shall be permitted, subject to meeting the adopted review criteria: 
1.  All uses in the R-1, R-4, and R-3 zone districts shall be allowed as provided in the table of approved uses section 117-99. 
2.  Consumer goods and convenience services including neighborhood commercial activities, providing such uses are subordinate to the permitted uses; are designed to serve primarily the residents of the development; and are harmoniously incorporated into the total design of the PUD. Such uses shall be identified at the time of preliminary approval. 
(2)  PUD-C Planned Unit Development Commercial: 
a.  Intent. The intent of the PUD-C district is to promote the architectural grouping of commercial and professional consumer oriented activities creating a harmonious relationship between people, structures and motor vehicles through the use of a well planned circulation, parking, pedestrian ways, courtyards, and landscaped open space areas. 
b.  Size. There is no minimum lot size for the PUD-C district, provided the proposed development is functional. 
c.  Permitted uses. For the PUD-C, the following uses shall be permitted, subject to meeting the adopted review criteria: all nonresidential uses in the CC (Center City Commercial), NC (Neighborhood Commercial), GC (General Commercial), HC (Highway Commercial) and O (Transitional Office) zone districts as provided in the table of approved uses, section 117-99. 
(3)  PUD-I Planned Unit Development Industrial: 
a.  Intent. The intent of the PUD-I district is to promote the architectural grouping of industrial wholesale, warehouse, light and heavy manufacturing activities creating a harmonious relationship between people, structures, operations and motor vehicles through the use of a well planned circulation, parking, pedestrian ways, outside storage, and landscaped open space areas. 
b.  Size. There is no minimum lot size for the PUD-I district, provided the proposed development is functional. 
c.  Permitted uses. For the PUD-I, the following uses shall be permitted, subject to meeting the adopted review criteria: all permitted uses in the M-1 (light manufacturing) and M-2 (heavy manufacturing) zone districts as provided in the table of approved uses section 117-99. 
(4)  PUD-MU Planned Unit Development Mixed Use: 
a.  Intent. The intent of the PUD-MU district is to allow for the integration of residential, commercial, and industrial development within an area so as to ensure the formation of a self-sustaining project. Light industrial uses, including those permitted in the M-1 (light manufacturing) zone, are permitted, provided they complement the commercial uses and do not substantially impact the residential uses. The following provisions apply to the PUD-MU district: 
1.  The developer shall establish that a special type of business and professional community will be created which benefits the citizens who occupy the residential component of the proposal. 
2.  The city shall pay special attention to how the design of the PUD-MU district will affect the physical and social environment of the land and people who occupy the residential units. 
3.  The number of residential units that may be built is flexible; however, the proposed number must achieve an acceptable balance for achieving self sustainability of the proposed development. 
4.  Commercial and industrial development within a PUD-MU shall be located so as not to create undue traffic congestion or street hazards. Consideration shall be given to anticipated pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular impacts, adjacent development providing multiple use of off-street parking facilities, and the types of commercial uses implicated. The parking areas, services areas, buffers, entrances, exits, yards, courts, landscaping, graphics and lighting shall be designed as integrated portions of the total PUD-MU proposal. 
b.  Size. There is no minimum lot size for the PUD-MU district, provided the proposed development is functional and facilitates self-sustainability. 
c.  Uses permitted. Within a PUD-MU district the following uses shall be permitted subject to meeting all applicable criteria and regulations: any permitted, conditional or accessory use allowed in the R-1, R-4, R-3, CC, NC, GC, HC, O, M-1 zone district as allowed in section 117-91. 
d.  Supplementary uses. Residential dwellings may be constructed above commercial uses provided: 
1.  Separate access to dwelling units is provided; 
2.  No commercial uses shall occupy the same floor as one occupied by a dwelling unit. 
(Prior Code, § 23-198; Ord. No. 1591 6-2009)  
Sec. 117-215. - Review criteria. 
(a)  Planned unit developments provide a more flexible approach to the physical development providing an opportunity for creative development planning and building design, to the end that the public health, safety and general welfare will be better served by tailoring development to the unique or special characteristics of the subject property and surrounding area. The city shall evaluate all planned unit development plans pursuant to the following criteria, which may be applicable to the particular circumstances, balancing and evaluating the implementation of such criteria to maximize, to the greatest practical extent, the community interest and welfare. 
(b)  Comprehensive plan and code requirements: 
(1)  Is the proposed development in accordance with all elements of the city plan including, but not limited to, land use plan, planning sub-area land use recommendations and traffic circulation? 
(2)  Have all provisions of the land development code and general conditions, technical specifications and stormwater management plan been met? If not, have the exceptions/variances requested been thoroughly evaluated and made a part of the PUD design? 
(3)  For a PUD that includes an exception to the height standards, have the following been satisfied? 
a.  Proposed structure's affect upon adjacent properties is minimal with respect to a compatibility of use and design, alternative energy access, visual access, and rights of privacy, light and air. 
b.  Public services can be provided to the structure at a level currently enjoyed by the surrounding area, or at adequate levels per existing city policies and regulations. 
c.  Project complies with all adopted fire department regulations and standards. 
(c)  Public facilities. Is there present and available adequate capacity to serve the proposed development, at appropriate service levels, in conformance with city policy and regulations with water, sewer, electricity, storm drainage, streets, etc. without negatively impacting the service levels of the surrounding neighborhoods, or have arrangements been made for extension and/or augmentation to adequately serve the proposed development and mitigate negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods? 
(d)  Neighborhood compatibility. 
(1)  Are the scale, building bulk and orientation, setbacks, landscaping and visual integrity of the proposed development appropriate for the development, sensitive to the immediate area, compatible with the character of the neighborhood and do they promote the stabilization of the surrounding neighborhood? 
(2)  Does the design and layout of the proposed development facilitate the development of adjacent property rather than limit design options for adjacent landowners? 
(e)  Natural resource protection. 
(1)  Does the proposed development preserve significant existing vegetation (i.e., large trees and unique features of the site? 
(2)  If the project contains known areas of natural or geologic hazard, including unstable slopes, floodways, high groundwater tables, sink holes or soil conditions unfavorable to urban development, will special engineering precautions be taken to address satisfactorily those limitations or have these areas been appropriately set aside and restricted from development? 
(f)  Land uses. Is the land use mix appropriate and do they meet the restrictions of section 117-214? 
(g)  Development assurances: 
(1)  The city council may require adequate assurance, in a form and manner that it approves, that the common open space, amenities and public improvements shown in the final development plan will be provided and fully developed. 
(2)  The city may accept an irrevocable letter, cash escrow or other acceptable financial guarantee, in an amount sufficient to ensure installation and completion of the public improvements and amenities associated with the final development plan. 
(h)  Design standards. The following design standards shall be used during the review process as guidelines for evaluating the PUD. If any specific standard causes extraordinary hardship or if the applicant demonstrates that the intent of the standard will be better accomplished by other appropriate means, such alternatives may be considered through the review process: 
(1)  Density increases will be allowed with the formation of a PUD district. Density increases shall not exceed 50 percent of the permitted maximum density of the underlying zone district, if the PUD is used as an overlay, or land use designation of the city plan is zoned PUD-R. The calculation of density increase shall be based on the sum of those amenities or public improvements included within the development proposal. The types of amenities or public improvements as outlined in the following schedule are illustrative of the kinds eligible for density bonus consideration. The city encourages new creative ideas for density bonus consideration. For those amenities not contained on the following list, percentage bonuses shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and weighed according to their similarity to the prescribed schedule and its contribution (bona-fide benefit) to the development proposal. 
Maximum 
Density Increase 	Amenity or Public Improvement in Excess of 

What is Typically Required 
5 percent 	Ten percent additional landscaping

1 percent 	If dwelling is within 1,500 feet of a school 
1 percent 	Additional fire protection techniques 
 
(2)  Parcel size. There shall be no minimum parcel size for a PUD; however, it must be large enough to enable its development as a complete identifiable unit and, through flexibility allowed by the PUD process, provide bona fide benefits to the residential users of the PUD. Recommended minimum lot size for a detached single-family residential PUD is 6,600 square feet when less than 20 percent open space is provided. 
(3)  Open space. The minimum required open space in residential PUDs shall be 20 percent of the total site. The required open space shall be land areas not occupied by buildings, structures, parking areas, driveways, streets or alleys. Said open space shall be devoted to landscaping, walkways, recreational areas and uncovered facilities and preservation of natural features. If there exists common open space in residential PUDs a minimum of 75 percent shall be contiguous lands generally free from obstructions that affect the intended functionality of the open space. Common open spaces shall be distributed equitably throughout the project in relation to the dwelling units of the residents to be served and shall be reasonably accessible to all of the PUD residents. 
(4)  Natural amenities. The required open space may be left in its natural state if the city determines that the natural landscape should be preserved. Areas devoted to natural flood-control channels or drainage easements may be applied toward satisfying this portion of the total open space requirement. 
(5)  Clustering. Clustering of dwelling units, commercial and industrial uses is encouraged as long as buffer yards, open space and emergency access are adequately planned. Buffer yards shall be required to separate different uses in order to eliminate or minimize potential interference and nuisances on adjacent properties. The size of the buffer yard shall be determined through the review process, based on its ability to achieve appropriate separation. 
(6)  Landscaping. A landscape plan, prepared pursuant to the city's adopted landscape regulations, shall be required for all open space in a PUD, with the exception of those areas which the city determines would be most beneficial to the project and the community if left in their natural or existing condition due to those areas' natural beauty or uniqueness. Existing trees, 18 inches in diameter or larger, shall be preserved wherever practical. 
(7)  Traffic circulation. 
a.  Primary vehicular access points to the PUD shall be designed to provide smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic. 
b.  Where appropriate, the internal circulation system shall provide pedestrian and bicycle paths that are physically separated from vehicular traffic to serve residential, nonresidential and recreational facilities provided in or adjacent to the PUD. 
c.  Where designated bicycle paths exist adjacent to the PUD, safe, convenient access shall be provided. The city may require, when necessary to achieve public safety, pedestrian or bicycle overpasses, underpasses or traffic signalization in the vicinity of parks, schools, shopping areas or other uses that may generate considerable pedestrian or bicycle traffic. 
(8)  Streets. The design of public streets within a PUD shall reflect the nature and function of the street. Existing city standards of design and construction may be modified only as is deemed appropriate by the city after recommendation by the street's superintendent, planning director, fire chief and police chief and based on unique circumstances. 
(9)  Parking standards. 
a.  Parking shall generally be provided as per the off-street parking requirements found in article V of chapter 111. 
b.  The city may decrease or increase the number of required parking spaces based upon such factors as: 
1.  The probable number of cars owned or required by the occupants anticipated; 
2.  The parking demand resulting from any nonresidential uses; 
3.  Varying time periods of use; and 
4.  The general location of the project. 
c.  All off-street parking areas, covered or open, in any PUD shall be screened by landscaping or otherwise from view from any public rights-of-way, except in single-family projects. 
d.  Commercial or industrial projects may reduce the number of parking spaces on site if perpetual joint use parking is provided off-site within 300 feet of the proposed use. 
(10)  Building spacing. No specific yard, setback, lot size, or building height requirements shall be imposed (except those required by adopted uniform codes, contemplating matters such as building separation) in any planned unit development district, provided that the spirit and intent of this section are complied with in the final development plan. The city may determine that certain setbacks and building heights be required within all or a portion of a PUD and in all cases the height specified in the base-zoning district should be used as a guide for building with the PUD. 
(11)  Noise attenuation. Noise attenuation shall be enforced and regulated as provided per the manufacturing/processing performance standards found in division 2 of this article.
