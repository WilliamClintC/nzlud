This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Charter Township of Delta, Eaton County, Michigan. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Township Board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.  
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6­2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE  CD1:1  
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES  CCT:1  
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE  SLT:1   
CODE INDEX   CDi:1  

Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.  
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.  
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and D.J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.  
The publisher is most grateful to Janice Vedder, former Township Clerk, and other Township staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Township's affairs.

The repeal of any prior ordinance of the township by any subsequent ordinance shall not operate to revive the provisions of any ordinance which may have been repealed by such prior ordinance, unless such revival shall be expressly provided for.

(Code 1992, § 1-7.1) 
Sec. 1-10. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a) 	
By contract or by township personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the township board. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so 

numbered that they will fit properly in the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.  

(b) 	
In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of this Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.  

(c) 	
When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 

(1) 
Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.  

(2) 	
Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 

(3) 	
Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.  

(4) 	
Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code).  

(5) 	
Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 


(Code 1992, § 1-8) 
Sec. 1-11. - Severability. 
Should any provision or section of this Code be held unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not be construed as affecting the validity of any of the remaining provisions or sections, it being the intent of the township board that this Code shall stand, notwithstanding the invalidity of any provision or section thereof. The provisions of this section shall apply to the amendment of any section of this Code, whether or not the wording of this section is set forth in the amendatory ordinance.  
(Code 1992, § 1-9) 
Sec. 1-12. - Fees and charges. 
All fees and charges provided for in this Code may be changed by resolution of the township board. Such resolutions shall be on file in the office of the township clerk.

Sec. 8-133. - Purpose. 
(a) 	
The township finds that the act of renting or leasing dwelling units is a business activity. The township also finds that dwellings or dwelling units which are leased or rented to the public, when improperly maintained, by reason of their structures, equipment, sanitation, use or occupancy, may adversely affect public health, safety and general welfare as well as the aesthetic value of surrounding property and community. To correct unsuitable conditions which exist within rental properties and to establish mechanisms for the continued maintenance of a sound rental housing stock within the township, and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens, the township establishes these regulations which shall require the registration of rental dwelling units and provide for the enforcement of minimum rental housing standards.  

(b) 	
This article supplements and augments the existing International Property Maintenance Code in protecting and promoting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the township by requiring the registration of all rental dwelling units in the township. This registration, combined with regular systematic inspections, will help prevent overcrowding, the incidence of communicable diseases, and will aid in the enforcement of the International Property Maintenance Code, which sets minimum allowable standards for adequate maintenance of habitable dwellings. This article is not intended nor shall it be used for the purpose of including the township in civil disputes between rental owners and tenants involving, but not limited to, nonpayment of rent, evictions and/or personal disputes.

(1) 
Provide a standard set of analytic tools and a format for preparing traffic impact studies.  

(2) 	
Allow the township to assess the effects that a proposed subdivision may have on the community by outlining information needed and evaluation procedures to be used.  

(3) 	
Help ensure safe and reasonable traffic-operating conditions on streets and intersections after development of the proposed subdivision.  

(4) 	
Reduce the negative traffic impacts created by individual subdivisions by helping to ensure that the transportation system can safely and efficiently accommodate the projected traffic increases. 

(5) 	
Realize a comprehensive approach to the overall impacts of the development of various subdivisions along a corridor or within part of the township rather than a piecemeal approach. 

(6) 	
Provide direction to township decision-makers, transportation agencies, and developers of the expected impacts of a subdivision. 

(7) 	
Alert the township, transportation agencies and developers of improvements or modifications needed to the roadway, access, or site design.  

(8) 
Protect the substantial public investment in the existing street system.  

(a)

(c) 	
Disposition of violations. The bureau may dispose only of municipal civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the bureau. Nothing in this article shall prevent or restrict the township from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal civil infraction violation at the bureau and may have the violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded by law.  

(d) 	
Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility. The scope of the bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions.

(e) 	
Municipal civil infraction violation notices.

(f) 	
Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the bureau and pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in person, or by representation.  

(g) 	
Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not paid. If an authorized township official issues and serves a municipal ordinance violation notice, and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the violation are not paid at the bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may be filed with the district court and a copy of the citation may be served by first class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by section 20-21, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

However, an attempt by the township to collect the civil fine, costs, civil sanctions, damages, expenses and/or an installment by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building, or structure.

(Ord. No. 10-56, § 8-202, 2-7-2011) 
Sec. 26-2. - Penalty for violation, municipal civil infraction. 
(a) 	
A person who violates any provision of this article or the terms or conditions of a license is responsible for a municipal civil infraction in accordance with article II of chapter 20. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the remedies available to the township in the event of a violation by a person of this article or a license. 

(b)

(Ord. No. 10-56, § 8-213, 2-7-2011) 
Sec. 26-3. - Intent. 
(a) 	
It is the intent of this chapter to give effect to the intent of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act as approved by the electors, and not to determine and establish an altered policy with regard to marihuana. The act authorizes a narrow exception to the general rule and state policy that the cultivation, distribution, and use of marihuana amount to criminal acts. It is the further intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of persons and property, and to license certain locations as specified section 26-31. This chapter is intended to comply with the Act while concurrently attempting to protect the health, safety, and welfare of law enforcement officers and other persons in the community, and also to address and minimize reasonably anticipated secondary effects upon children, other members of the public, and upon significant areas of the community, that would be reasonably expected to occur in the absence of the provisions of this chapter. This chapter is designed to recognize the fundamental intent of the Act to allow for a private and confidential patient-caregiver relationship to facilitate the statutory authorization for the limited cultivation, distribution, and medical use of marihuana; and to regulate around this fundamental intent in a manner that does not conflict with the Act so as to address issues that would otherwise expose the community and its residents to significant adverse conditions. 

(b) 	
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as allowing persons to engage in conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance, or to allow cultivation, distribution or use of marihuana contrary to the express authorizations of the Act and this chapter; and, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to undermine or provide immunity from federal law as it may be enforced by the federal or state government relative to the cultivation, distribution or use of marihuana. Thus, the authorization of activity, and the approval of a license under this chapter shall not have the effect of superseding or nullifying federal law applicable to the cultivation, distribution and use of marihuana.  

(a) 	
Under the Act law enforcement officers are prevented from securing the information necessary to determine whether or not the cultivation, distribution and use of marihuana are being conducted by persons authorized under the Act. Accordingly, the licensure of a particular location as the site of cultivation and distribution, which need not undermine the privacy and confidentiality of the parent-caregiver relationship, could be critical to law enforcement in order to identify and distinguish sites of lawful activity from sites of unlawful activity. 

(b) 	
The experience in the State of California, a state that approved the medical use of marihuana in 1996, is that concentrations of marihuana distribution activity lead to serious secondary effects including: 

(1) 	
Resale of products just obtained inside, since marihuana dispensaries regularly attract marihuana growers, drug users and drug traffickers sharing just purchased marihuana outside dispensaries; 

(2) 	
Street dealers lurking about dispensaries to offer a lower price for marihuana to arriving patrons; 

(3) 
Marihuana smoking in public and in front of children in the vicinity of dispensaries;  

(4) 	
Acquiring marihuana and/or money by means of robbery of patrons going to or leaving dispensaries; 

(5) 
Loitering;  

(6) 
An increase in burglaries at or near dispensaries; and 

(7) 
A loss of trade for other commercial businesses located near dispensaries.  

(c) 	
Children are not capable of making distinctions between the lawful and unlawful use and possession of marihuana by individuals based upon the intricacies of the Act. Therefore, there is a need to insulate children from the narrowly permitted use and possession of marihuana permitted under the Act.  

(d)

Sec. 26-5. - Findings of fact warranting restrictions on distribution. 
(a) 	
The Act reflects the intent to a private and confidential patient-caregiver relationship to facilitate the lawful cultivation, distribution, and use of marihuana strictly for medical purposes, that is, an authorization for confidential and private use of marihuana by patients, and for confidential and private assistance in such use by caregivers to individual patients. It is reasonable to expect and require that all undertakings of caregivers and other persons in assisting a patient are intended to occur on a confidential and private one-to-one basis. 

(b) 	
The confidentiality provisions of the Act reflect the intent for all caregivers and patients to remain anonymous in terms of their names and addresses, thus further reflecting the private and confidential nature of the activities contemplated between a caregiver and the patient he is assisting. 

(c) 	
It is deemed necessary to maintain, by licensure, an environment promoting the protection, efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcement officers and their work performed in connection with the cultivation, distribution or use of marihuana.  

(d) 	
All of the findings stated in section 26-4, in support of the requirement for licensure are incorporated by reference in this section.

(1) 	
Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that will exist if the variance is not granted.

(6) 	
It must be demonstrated by the appellant that granting the variance will result in substantial justice being done, while consideration is given to the impacts on the public health, safety and welfare.

(2) Notice of bypass. 
a. 	
If an industrial user knows of the need to bypass in advance, it shall submit prior notice and where possible, at least ten days before date of the bypass.  

b. 	
An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, the exact date and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The written report may be waived if the oral report is received within 24 hours. 


(3) 	Prohibition of bypass. The bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless:  
a. 	
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.  

b. 	
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated process water or maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.

Sanitary sewer service shall be discontinued 35 days after the billing date, if all necessary payments have not been made as required by this article, except as follows by subsection (f)(3) of this section. The 35-day requirement notwithstanding, the service shall not be discontinued unless the accounting department is open to receive payment on the day of and the day following discontinuation of service.  

(3) 	
When a customer claims hardship, the controller, at his discretion, may allow the customer to make reduced payments at intervals more frequent than the usual billing interval. These payments shall equal in total the monthly bill. This method of payment shall not allow a customer to defer full payment of the bill beyond 35 days after the billing date.  

(4) 	
The procedure for notification of default in payment of bills prior to service discontinuation shall be by sending a past due notice 20 days after the billing date. The past due notice shall state the amount due, the service discontinuation date, the additional charge to reinstate discontinued service, and that payment made after the service discontinuation date must be for all charges.  

(5) 	
Where service to a customer in default of a bill has been discontinued, the service shall not be restored until authorized by the accounting department. The accounting department shall not authorize restoration of service until arrangements for payment of all charges as may be required by ordinance, have been made. 

(g) 	
Returned (NSF) checks. An administrative fee as set by resolution of the township board shall be charged for handling returned checks.  

(h) 
Sewer service deposits. Sewer service deposits shall not be required, except as follows:  

(1) 	
Where annual notice is given in writing as provided for in section 21, Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), that a tenant is responsible for such charges and services as provided for by this article, then a cash deposit as established by township board resolution shall be made as security for payment of such charges and services. The deposit shall be returned after two years, if no default in payment of bills has occurred and if the customer has not been past due more than two times within a two-year period.  

(2) 
As required by subsection (i) of this section, pertaining to enforcement.  

(i) 	
Enforcement. Charges for sewer services shall constitute a lien on the property served, pursuant to section 21, Public Act No. 94 of 1933 (MCL 141.121), unless annual notice is given that a tenant is responsible and whenever such charges shall be delinquent for two months or more, the township officer in charge of the collection thereof shall certify annually before September 1 of each year, to the tax assessing officer of the township, the fact of such delinquency, whereupon such charge shall be by him entered upon the next tax roll as a charge against such premises and shall be collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general township taxes against such premises are collected and the lien thereof enforced; provided, however, where annual notice is given in writing that a tenant is responsible for such charges and services as provided by section 21, Public Act No. 94 of 1933 (MCL 141.121), no further service shall be rendered to such premises until a 

cash deposit equal to six months sewer charges shall have been made as security for payment of such charges and service. In addition to other lawful enforcement methods, the payment of charges for service to any premises may be enforced by discontinuing the sewer service to such premises.  

(j) 	
Winter averaging. Winter averaging, if any, shall be established by resolution of the township board, provided that the operation and maintenance and replacement components are uniformly applied to users subject to the rate.

Sec. 40-507. - Sewer main and capital charges. 
(a) 	
Sewer main and capital charges hereinafter established shall apply to all properties located within the boundaries of the township served by the public sewer system owned by the township. Those properties within the township served by public sewer furnished by the City of Lansing, or any other municipal corporation or township, shall be subject to such charges as may be provided for by contract between the township and such other municipality.  

(b) 	
Sewer capital charges for properties located outside the boundaries of the township shall be as arranged by agreement between the township and the property owners requesting such service and the unit of government where such property is situated; however, no capital charge shall be less than those charges to properties located within the township.  


(Code 1992, § 18-294; Ord. No. 279, § 5, 12-20-1982) 
Sec. 40-508. - Times and conditions of collection of charges. 
(a) 	
Charges imposed by this article shall be paid in full or refunded under the following conditions and at the following times unless otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this article:  

(1) 	
For each premises requesting to use or required to use the public sewage disposal system, unless previously paid, a sewer main charge will be collected as per section 40-509, and a sewer capital charge will be collected as per section 40-512.  

(2) 	
Upon application for a building permit for the purpose of erecting new buildings, main and/or benefit charges shall be collected. 

(3) 	
Upon application for a building permit to construct an addition to an existing premises, other than a single-family residence, all applicable sewer charges shall be paid at the same rate as though the addition were a new building. The sewer capital charge shall apply only to the addition being added, provided that the class of use of the premises is not being changed. 

(4) 	
Sewer capital charges, once paid for the first occupant's use, shall not be further adjusted for future changes in occupancy unless there is intensification of a use by a classification change, structural, plumbing addition, or other changes that would create a larger demand on the system. Charges for such added use shall be paid upon application for building permit; or if a building permit is not required by ordinance, then such additional charges shall be paid prior to a plumbing permit; or if neither a building or plumbing permit is required by ordinance, then the additional charge shall be paid prior to occupancy by the new occupant.  

(5) 	
If a sewer capital charge rate has not been established by township board resolution in regard to a particular use, then the time of collection shall be as described in section 40-512.  

(6) 	
Upon application for authorization to connect a new building, existing building, or lateral sewer main connection to the public sewer, all applicable charges shall be collected, except as provided in sections 40-513, 40-514 and 40-516.  

(7) 	
When the class of use of a proposed building, existing building or addition to an existing building is not set forth in the application for building permit, the sewer capital charge shall be the amount as established by township board resolution for unknown occupancies. This charge shall be adjusted at the time that the first total building occupancy or use class is known. 

(8) 	
Prior to start of construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings when a building permit is not required, all applicable charges shall be paid (for example, schools).  

(9) 	
If an application is withdrawn (in writing), then the charges due under this article shall be refunded, less an administrative charge.  

(b) 	
The requirements of this section shall not apply to those properties served by a sewer furnished by a municipal corporation or township other than the township, but rather the contracted terms, amounts and methods of payment shall apply.  


(Code 1992, § 18-295; Ord. No. 279, § 6, 12-20-1982; Ord. No. 93-6, 8-16-1993) 
Sec. 40-509. - Establishment of main charges. 
Main charges for sewer are hereby established for the privilege of connecting premises to the public sewer system as follows:  
(1) 	
When the public sewer mains available to such premises were constructed with public funds and the premises have not been specially assessed for any portion of the installing cost.  

(2) 	
When the public sewer mains available to such premises were financed by nonpublic funds and such premises did not participate in full in the financing of those services. 

(3) 	
It is the intent of this main charge to ensure that each premises connecting to the sewage disposal system of the township shall share its respective portion of the cost of installation of mains. 

(4) 	
Lateral sewer main connections to the public sewer system shall be subject to a benefit charge in lieu of a sewer main charge, as per section 40-510(3).  


(Code 1992, § 18-296; Ord. No. 279, § 7, 12-20-1982; Ord. No. 93-6, 8-16-1993) 
Sec. 40-510. - Computation of sewer main charges. 
The amount of sewer main charges shall be determined as follows:  
(1) 	
Sewer main charges for premises served by sewers installed as part of assessment districts, but not assessed thereunder, shall be charged to and payable by a premises on the same basis as originally determined by the township board for the assessment district with a deferral charge added as set by resolution of the township board.  

(2) 	
Sewer main charges for premises abutting a sewer for which no assessment district exists shall be either one-half of the average cost per linear foot of main according to pipe size in the project under which the sewer main being charged for was actually installed, times the length of the abutting property on each side of the sewer main, or shall be based upon any other method that the township board, by resolution, determines to be proper. A deferral charge shall be added, as set by resolution of the township board. In those cases where the sewer main abutting a premises is actually larger than eight inches and/or deeper than 20 feet, then the cost shall be proportioned as if it had been an eight-inch main no deeper than 20 feet, or shall be proportioned as the township board, by resolution, determines to be proper. 

(3) 	
Where a lateral sewer main is connected to the public sewer system or where premises do not directly abut a sewer main such as, but not limited to, premises beyond the end of a dead-end road, on a road or street turnaround, landlocked premises, or property served for the end of the public sewer system, the township board shall by resolution determine the benefit charge that shall be imposed in lieu of a sewer main charge. 

(4) 	
Where privately funded sewer mains (under contract with the township board) are installed and individual building sewer stubs are connected to such lateral mains, those mains may be connected into the public sewer system without paying a sewer main charge, however, the lateral sewer main is subject to the benefit charge, pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. This provision in no way exempts sewer main charges to those platted lots or other parcels which stub into a public main directly rather than via the privately funded lateral mains. 

(5) 	
Where a parcel lies at the intersection of two streets or roads and is abutted on both of those sides by sewer mains, the footage for which a sewer main charge is made shall be calculated as follows to grant a measure of relief to the property owner: 

a. 	
Where both property lines and mains abutting the intersecting streets are less than 200 feet long, only the shorter of the two property lines shall be used in calculating the sewer main charges. 

b. 	
If one or both property lines and mains abutting the intersecting streets are over 200 feet in length, 200 feet shall be subtracted from the total footage of abutting mains in calculating the sewer main charge. 




(Code 1992, § 18-297; Ord. No. 279, § 8, 12-20-1982; Ord. No. 93-6, 8-16-1993; Ord. No. 95-6, § 1, 10-2-1995) 
Sec. 40-511. - Stub charges. 
When no sewer stub exists, the property owner shall bear the expense of installation of such stub. Where a sewer stub has been provided but not otherwise reimbursed to the township, it shall be paid at the time the sewer main charges are due at the rate per stub of the actual installed cost and an interest charge prorated through the month of payment.  
(Code 1992, § 18-298; Ord. No. 279, § 9, 12-20-1982) 
Sec. 40-512. - Capital charges. 
(a) 	
A capital charge as set by resolution of the township board, per single-family residence or residential equivalent unit shall be charged as a condition of obtaining service from the system.  

(b) 	
The township board shall adopt and revise from time to time if necessary, a schedule of residential equivalent unit factors representing the ratio of average residential sewage use to volume of nonresidential uses. Such schedule shall be used in determining capital charges except as otherwise provided herein. When the charge is based upon building area, the outside perimeter of the walls shall be used. 

(c) 	
The township building official may require metering of private water supply systems to verify the accuracy of charges. 

(d) 	
If a sewer capital charge rate has not been established by resolution in regard to a particular use, then with approval of the township board, an estimated charge shall be made and such charge collected prior to connection to the township system, except where otherwise provided in this article. Where this procedure is used, the user shall, as a condition of connection, give written assurance to the township providing for a later adjustment of the connection fee. The adjustment shall be based 

upon the ratio of actual volume of sewer use by such customer to the average use of a single-family residence. 

(e) 	
Initial sewer capital charges for industrial users shall be determined by using the most current accumulated system value as established by resolution of the township board and expressed as a rate per 1,000 cubic feet, multiplied by the user's commitment to a projected annual sewage volume, divided by 1,000. The minimum charge shall be as set by resolution of the township board. The township will review the actual annual sewage volume of each industrial user. No additional capital charge will be made for actual annual sewage volumes in excess of the projected volume on which the current capital charge is based, if the excess is less than ten percent of the initial projected volume. Similarly, no additional capital charges will be made for any single year in which the excess exceeds ten percent, but is less than 20 percent. For any two consecutive years (eight billing quarters) that the user's sewage volume (on which the current capital charge is based) has been exceeded by ten percent of the current capital charge volume commitment or for any single year that the excess exceeds 20 percent, then an additional charge, calculated upon the last four quarters' use, shall be made to the user based on the most recent accumulated value of the sanitary sewer system and calculated by the same method as the initial charge. The total of such additional capital charge shall be due and payable upon receipt of an invoice unless deferral is permitted under section 40-513. With approval of the township board an industrial user may commit to a larger annual sewage volume and pay the appropriate capital charge increase therefor at any time. Each sewage volume commitment by an industrial user and any subsequent changes thereto shall be documented by a separate agreement with the township.  

(f) 	
There shall be no rebate of capital charges once paid.  

(g) 	
Sewer capital charges once paid shall not be transferred to other parcels of land, other buildings, or other portions of buildings. However, if a building is removed, then such charge, if paid or assumed to have been paid, can be credited towards another building to be located on the same parcel of property.  


(Code 1992, § 18-299; Ord. No. 279.4, § 1, 4-2-1990; Ord. No. 94-2, § 1, 2-21-1994) 
Sec. 40-513. - Additions and connections to the public sewer. 
(a) 	
No additions by other than the township shall be allowed to the public sewer system except by prior contract with the township board.  

(b) 	
Where the township board contracts with the first party to extend the sewer system with private funds, then the first party shall not be levied main charges on the privately funded sewer mains specifically covered by the contract. The foregoing also applies to sewer stub installation charges if the first party also installs same under a contract with the township board. The exemption on main charges and sewer stub charges in this subsection shall not extend either to sewer mains abutting the first party's property which were funded publicly or by persons other than the first party or the benefit charge for lateral main connections to the public sewer system.  

(c) 	
The township, by contract with the first party, may agree to collect main and stub charges from third parties and rebate such charges to the first party. The contract shall specify that total rebates shall not exceed the actual cost of construction abutting a third party's properties or the amount of main and stub charges to be collected from a third party, whichever is the lesser amount. The township shall have the sole authority to determine what future connections are subject to rebate of main charges to the first party. The first party shall not contract with, or otherwise exact any fee from, any third party who desires to connect to and/or use any addition to the public sewer system. 

(d) 
No persons shall be exempted from capital charges.  

(e) 	
All plans and specifications for additions and connections to the public sewer system, including lateral connections, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the township engineer.  

(f) 	
Except as provided herein, no permits for use of the public sewer system shall be requested or issued until after the addition to the public sewer system has been certified in writing as being satisfactorily complete by the township engineer and the proper deeds of grant, waivers of lien and easement agreements are provided to the township. The township manager may grant temporary use permits for periods not to exceed 60 days. In the event of a violation of this section, the township may, without notice or any liability to the first party, disconnect the addition to the public sewer system, shutoff or disconnect the public water supply and/or take any other action necessary to prevent the flow of sewage into the addition to the public sewer system. The first party shall pay all costs, including actual attorney's fees, which the township incurs in enforcing the provisions of this section.

Sec. 40-514. - Deposits and time deferred payments. 
Main and stub charges are costs which customarily are spread over a period of years. In order to avail more township customers within the township's boundaries of the advantages of long-term financing, such charges may be deferred and paid in installments as permitted herein:  
(1) 	
Main and stub charges. Main and stub charges established herein may be paid in 15 equal annual installments bearing interest at a rate as determined by resolution of the township board on the unpaid principal balance as computed at the time of connection. This deferral of main and stub charges shall apply only to those properties situated within the boundaries of the township. 

(2) 	
Lateral benefit charges. The township board by resolution may permit lateral benefit charges established under section 40-510(3) to be paid at such times and upon such other terms and conditions as the township board determines, in its discretion, to be proper. 

(3) 	
Sanitary sewer capital charges. Sewer capital charges with total amounts, or estimated amounts in cases of unestablished charges as per section 40-512, equal to or greater than $10,000.00 may be deferred and paid in equal periodic payments not less than annually over a period not exceeding 15 years in duration at the rate as determined by resolution of the township board for those building sewer hookups made to the sanitary sewer system prior to January 1, 1983. As a prerequisite to deferring capital charge payments, ten percent of the total capital charge or estimated capital charge shall be paid prior to hooking up to the sewer system. Unestablished capital rates for the above shall be as per section 40-512. If an estimated charge has been deferred and it is determined at a later date that the total charge is to be less than $10,000.00, then the difference between the initial payment of the total charge shall be due and payable upon receipt of an invoice. If in fact, it is determined that the total charge is $10,000.00 or more, but is less or greater than the estimated initial charge, then such initial charge and future payments shall be adjusted to reflect such difference. If it is determined that additional sanitary sewer capital charges are due for industrial users because of increased volumes, projections, or commitments, then these additional charges may be deferred, provided that these additional charges are equal to or greater than $10,000.00, and also provided that at least ten percent of the total additional charge is paid upon receipt of an invoice and with the balance paid in equal periodic payments not less than annually over a period of 15 years at the maximum interest rate permitted hereunder. This deferral of capital sewer charges shall apply only to those properties situated within the boundaries of the township. 


(Code 1992, § 18-301; Ord. No. 279, § 11, 12-20-1982; Ord. No. 95-6, § 1, 10-2-1995) 
Sec. 40-515. - Interest charges. 
Whenever an interest charge is computed hereunder it shall be computed at a rate to be set by the township board by resolution per annum on the principal amount of the charge for the unpaid principal balance, unless the township shall have issued bonds to finance the cost of the facility or improvement for which a charge is made, in which event the interest rate shall be at a rate to be set by the township board by resolution per annum or such greater rate, but not exceeding one percent in excess of the rate at which bonds are sold as may be determined by the township board. 
(Code 1992, § 18-302; Ord. No. 279, § 12, 12-20-1982) 
Sec. 40-516. - Hardship. 
(a) 	
Persons owning property with buildings located thereon and residing thereon who are required by state law, the Barry-Eaton District Health Department or by ordinance to connect to a public sewer system or who desire to connect to same may apply to the township board for hardship consideration in regard to payment of the various charges required by this article. 

(b) 	
The board shall determine in its discretion for each application if a hardship exists. The board may require such proofs as it deems necessary to determine if a hardship actually exists and the degree thereof. 

(c) 	
If the township board determines that a hardship exists, a lien shall be placed against the property. All charges (including capital charges) required under this article may be deferred by use of the methods listed in subsection (d) of this section, chosen at the discretion of the board. In no event shall the property change ownership without payment in full of the charges due. (Survivorship of part owners shall not be considered an ownership change.)  

(d) 	
At its discretion, the board may require one or more of the following hardship payment methods, in full, in part, or in combination:  

(1) 
Use of the method allowed in section 40-514(1), for all charges (including capital charges). 

(2) 	
Deferral of all charges (including capital charges) until the property changes ownership. Charges shall bear interest at the rate determined by resolution of the township board. The property owner may pay off any and all charges with interest due at any time. The township board may at its discretion determine that the hardship is ending and require immediate payment of all charges due (the property owner may still elect to use section 40-514(1), to the extent allowed therein to nonhardship cases.) If, at its discretion, the board determines that the hardship is reduced, it may require payment by use of section 40-514(1).

SECTION 3.03 CERTIFICATES OF ZONING COMPLIANCE 
A. 	Purpose. A permit for erection, alteration, or moving of any building shall not be issued by the Zoning Administrator until a Certificate of Zoning Compliance has been issued.  It shall be unlawful to use, occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof

SECTION 3.05 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE 
A. 	Purpose and Intent.  In the interest of ensuring compliance with the Zoning Ordinance provisions, the Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to deposit a performance guarantee for any or all site improvements required by this Ordinance.  The purpose of the performance guarantee is to ensure completion of improvements connected with the proposed use as required by this Ordi­nance including but not limited to: the installation of roadways, landscaping, curbs, lighting, drain­age, sidewalks, pathways, driveways, utilities, and similar items. 
A performance guarantee may be a cash deposit, certified check, or irrevocable bank letter of credit in the amount of the cost of the improvements based upon an itemized estimate submitted by the applicant and verified by the Township. The Township shall be authorized to employ the Zoning Ad­ministrator, Township Engineer and/or Township consultants to review cost estimates, and conduct periodic inspection of the progress of improvements. 
B. 	Procedure.  Performance guarantees shall be processed in the following manner: 
1. 	
Upon receipt of the required performance guarantee, and provided all other applicable standards and requirements have been met, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall is­sue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance. 

2. 	
The Zoning Administrator, upon the written request of the obligor, shall rebate portions of the performance guarantee upon determination that the improvements for which the rebate has been requested have been satisfactorily completed. The portion of the perfor­mance guarantee to be rebated shall be in the same amount as stated in the itemized cost 

estimate for the applicable improvement. 

3. 	
Upon completion of the required improvements, the obligor shall provide the Zoning Ad­ministrator with a written notice of the completion. Within thirty (30) days of the obligors notice, the Zoning Administrator shall inspect the improvements and inform the obligor whether the improvements are approved, partially approved, or rejected. If rejected, the Zoning Administrator shall provide a written statement of the reasons for rejection. If the improvements are partially approved, the Zoning Administrator shall release the obligor from liability pertaining to the relevant portions of the performance guarantee, and inform 


the obligor of the remainder of the performance guarantee retained. 
4. 	In the event the applicant defaults in making the improvements for which the performance guarantee was required, the Township shall have the right to use the performance guar­antee deposited and any interest earned thereon to complete the improvements through 
contract or otherwise, including, specifically, the right to enter upon the subject property to 
make the improvements. 
5. 	If the performance guarantee is not sufficient to allow the Township to complete the re­quired improvements for which such guarantee was posted, the applicant shall be required 
to pay the Township the amount by which the cost of completing the improvements exceeds the amount of the performance guarantee, or a portion thereof, to complete the required improvement. Any amounts remaining after said completion shall be applied first to the Townships administrative costs including, without limitation, attorney fees, planning con­sultant fees, and engineering consultant fees in completing the improvement with any 





balance remaining being refunded to the applicant. 
6. 	A record of authorized performance guarantees shall be maintained by the Zoning Admin­istrator. 
SECTION 3.06 APPLICATION FEES 
Before considering any application submitted in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance, a fee shall be collected by the Zoning Administrator. The fee for the various applications shall be set from time to time by the Township Board by resolution. 
SECTION 3.07 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES 
A. 	Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall constitute a violation and shall be punishable as a municipal civil infraction as prescribed by Chapter 1 of the Code of 
Ordinances of the Charter Township of Delta. 
B. 	This Ordinance shall be enforced by the Zoning Administrator, or designees who are hereby des­
ignated as the authorized Township Official to issue municipal civil infraction violation notices, directing alleged violators to appear at the Township of Delta Municipal Violations Bureau as pro­vided by the Code of Ordinances of the Charter Township of Delta. 
C. 	The issuance of municipal civil infraction citations shall be pursuant to the Code of Ordinances of the Charter Township of Delta. 
SECTION 3.08 COMPLIANCE WITH PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES 
Building permits or Certificates of Zoning Compliance issued on the basis of approved plans and applica­tion authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applica­tions, and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance, and punishable as provided by Section 3.07, herein.

Landscaping.  A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the site area shall be comprised of landscaping 
which may include the preservation of existing trees, planting of new trees and plant materials, installation of planting beds, and other practices as approved by the Zoning Administrator. Green­belts, buffer strips, and parking lot landscaping shall be credited towards the ten percent (10%) minimum. 
Building Design. 
1. 	Building materials for principal buildings shall include, but not be limited to, wood, brick, 
clapboards, glass, stone, and integrally tinted/textured concrete masonry units.  No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total exterior wall area of any principal building shall consist of, or be composed of vinyl, metal, aluminum, plastic, plain faced concrete masonry unit, precast concrete, cement plaster, exterior insulation finishing system, glass 
block, canvas awnings, asphalt shingles, or other materials determined by the Zoning Ad­ministrator to be comparable in grade and quality, or any combination thereof. The walls (north, south, east and west) of each building shall be considered separately for the pur­
pose of calculating the percentages of materials in compliance with the aforementioned 
standard.  
2. 	Ground floor exterior façades that face West Saginaw Highway shall have transparent win­dows and doorways that cover no less than forty (40) percent of their horizontal length. The windows and doors shall maintain the required transparency and shall not be covered 
over with boards, film, or paint. Security gates or grillwork on the inside or outside of the 
windows or doors must be primarily transparent. Window signs shall be regulated as per 
the requirements of the Delta Township Sign Ordinance. 
3. 	Building facades and exterior walls greater than fifty (50) feet in length, measured horizon­tally, shall incorporate recesses or projections with a minimum depth of five (5) feet along 
at least twenty percent (20%) for the length of the façade or wall. 
4. 	Parapets shall be provided to conceal flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as HVAC units from public view.  Buildings with pitched roofs shall provide overhanging eaves a minimum 
of twelve (12) inches including gutter, and an average slope greater than 4:12. 
5. 	Ground mounted HVAC and similar systems shall be screened from street level view on all sides by an opaque structure or appropriate landscape materials. 
General Design Practices. The following practices are encouraged when redeveloping properties in the WSOD:   
1. 	
Rehabilitation of properties which have become deteriorated or have non-conforming buildings. 

2. 	
Construction of mixed-use buildings with a combination of residential, office, and/or retail tenants. 

3. 	
Construction of multi-story buildings. 

4. 	
Limiting parking in the required front yard and, if such parking is provided, screening options shall be considered. 

5. 	
Use of ground signs, rather than pole signs for identification. 

6. 	
Provision of pedestrian-friendly features such as benches and shaded outdoor seating areas. 

7. 	
Use of underground storm water storage facilities rather than open detention/retention ponds. 









J. 	Signage. Signage within the WSOD shall be subject to the provisions of the Delta Township Sign Ordinance. 
K. 	Lighting.  All lighting within the WSOD shall be subject to the provisions of Section 12.05. 



SECTION 4.17 SUPPLEMENTAL DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS 
A. 	Continued Conformity with Bulk Regulations. The maintenance of setback, height, floor area ratio, coverage, open space, transition strip, lot area and lot area per dwelling unit required for one (1) use, lot, building or structure shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such building or struc­ture or of the lot on which such use, building or structure is in existence.  Furthermore, no setback, height, floor area ratio, coverage, open space, transition strip, lot area per dwelling unit allocated to or required about or in connection with one (1) lot, use, building or structure may be allocated to 
any other lot, use, building or structure. 
B. 	Division of a Lot.  No one (1) lot, once designated and improved with a building or structure, shall be 
reduced in area, or divided into two (2) or more lots, and no portion of one (1) lot, once designated and improved with a building or structure, shall be sold unless each lot resulting from each such reduction, division or sale, and designated and improved with a building or structure, shall conform with all of the bulk and yard regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
C. 	Dwellings per Lot or Parcel.  A lot or parcel zoned NR, AG1, AG2, RA, RB, RC, or RM shall contain no more than one (1) single-family dwelling, nor more than one (1) two-family dwelling if two-family dwellings are permitted. This sub-section shall not apply to authorized Planned Unit Developments, Condominium Subdivisions, or Multiple-Family Dwelling Developments. 
D. 	Permitted Front Setback Reductions.  Where the front setback of existing building is less than the required minimum front setback required in the underlying zoning district, the minimum front set­
back for a proposed building shall be the average front setback of existing buildings on the same side 
of the street within two hundred (200) feet of the side yard property line of the proposed building 
site. There shall be two (2) existing buildings on the same side of the street within two hundred 
(200) feet of the side yard property line of the proposed building site in order to establish an average 
front setback, otherwise the minimum front setback specified in the underlying zoning district shall 
apply.  In no case shall the minimum required front setback be less than twenty (20) feet. 
E. 	Permitted Yard Encroachments.  
1. 	Certain architectural features such as cornices, eaves, gutters, chimneys, pilasters and simi­





lar features may project three (3) feet into the required front setback areas, five (5) feet into required rear setback areas and two (2) feet into the required side setback area. 
2. 	
An unenclosed porch, deck, balcony or awning may project from a principal building into the required rear setback area for a distance not to exceed fifteen (15) feet; into a required front setback area for a distance not to exceed eight (8) feet; and into a required side set­back area for a distance not to exceed three (3) feet, but in no case shall a balcony, porch, or awning be placed closer than five (5) feet to any lot line. When projecting from a de­tached accessory building, an unenclosed porch, balcony or awning must comply with the minimum setback requirements for detached accessory buildings in Section 9.02. Physical structures relating to barrier-free access, such as ramps, shall not be required to comply with setback requirements. 

3.

G. 	Cul-de-Sac Lots. 
1. 	A lot shall be considered to be a cul-de-sac lot if the lot has more than one-half (0.5) of its required frontage on the cul-de-sac.  The one-half (0.5) required frontage shall be deter­
mined prior to reducing the required frontage permitted by subsection 3, below. 
2. 	
The cul-de-sac shall be determined to commence at the intersection of the radius of the cul-de-sac with the street right-of-way line. 

3. 	
A lot on a cul-de-sac shall have frontage on a cul-de-sac which is not less than eighty per­cent (80%) of the minimum lot width required for the zoning district in which it is located. 







H. Corner Lots. 
1. 	General provisions for corner lots:

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 
SECTION 5.01 PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a process to permit flexibility in the regulation of land develop­ment, to allow a mixture of uses, to encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout, and type of structure constructed, to achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and the provision of public services and utilities, to encourage the creation of useful open spac­es, and provide better housing, employment and shopping opportunities. This chapter is not intended as a device to disregard the Townships zoning regulations nor the planning concepts advocated in the 
Comprehensive Plan. 
SECTION 5.02 AUTHORIZATION 
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall be permitted as stipulated in the District Use Table via the grant­ing of a Special Land Use permit by the Township Board following a public hearing and a recommendation from the Planning Commission. The Special Land Use Permit shall be processed as per the requirements of Chapter 7 of this Ordinance. All PUD applications shall be accompanied by the necessary fees and a preliminary site plan as per the requirements of Chapter 6 of this Ordinance. 
SECTION 5.03 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR REVIEW 
The Planning Commission and Township Board shall apply the following general standards when reviewing 
PUD applications: 
A. 	The proposed development shall be consistent with, and further the implementation of the Com­prehensive Plan or represent land use policies which are a logical and acceptable change in the Comprehensive Plan. 
B. 	The proposed development shall be adequately served by public facilities and services including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks and pathways, water and sanitary sewer facilities, drainage improvements, and police and fire protection, or the applicant shall confirm that these facilities 
and services can be provided. 
C. 	The development shall encourage the provision of useful open spaces and long-term conservation of natural features and resources. 
D. 	The mix of housing types and densities and the relationship between residential and non-residen­tial uses shall be acceptable in terms of convenience, privacy, and compatibility. 
E. 	A PUD may be used to redevelop or improve an existing property where current ordinances do not provide the flexibility required for the adaptive reuse of the property, infrastructure and buildings.

CHAPTER 6 

SITE PLAN REVIEW 
SECTION 6.01 PURPOSE 
The site plan review requirements of this Chapter are intended to provide a consistent and uniform meth­od of review of proposed development plans, to ensure full compliance with the regulations in this Ordi­nance, other applicable ordinances, and state and federal laws.  The intent is to encourage a harmonious relationship of buildings and uses both within a site and in relation to adjacent uses; achieve efficient use of the land; encourage innovative design solutions; protect natural resources; ensure safety for both inter­nal and external vehicular and pedestrian users; and prevent adverse impacts on adjoining or nearby prop­erties. It is the intent of these provisions to encourage cooperation and consultation between the Town­ship and the applicant to facilitate development in accordance with the Townships land use objectives. 
SECTION 6.02 BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES SUBJECT TO SITE PLAN 

REVIEW 
A. Site Plan Review Requirement.  The following buildings, structures, and uses require site plan 
review:  
1. 	
All proposed and permitted uses and related buildings, except single-family and two-fam­ily dwellings. 

2. 	
All proposed Special Land Uses and related buildings except that home occupations, func­tional family dwellings, bed and breakfast establishments, group child care homes, foster care group homes, and farm markets shall only be required to provide the following infor­mation for preliminary site plan review: 

a. 	
Site Plan application form supplied by the Zoning Administrator. 

b. 	
A Site Plan containing the following information: 




i. 	Legal description of site dimensions of site boundary lines, total site area, water courses and water bodies. Locations of all buildings, driveways, park­ing areas; and other structures on adjacent properties within one hundred 
(100) feet of the property, including those located across the street from the property. 
ii. 	Required and proposed building setbacks, and if applicable, distances between buildings on the site. 
iii. 	Location of abutting streets and proposed alignment of streets, drives and easements serving the development, including existing rights-of-way and pavement widths. 
iv. 	The Planning Commission and/or Zoning Administrator, as applicable, may require written statements relative to the impact on existing utilities, natural features, or the environment. 





3. 	
Any alteration, addition, or expansion of an existing permitted or Special Land Use and/or related building; 

4. 	
Any building or use for which site plan review is required by this Ordinance; and 

5. 	
Any parking lot or addition thereto. 


B. 	Status of Site Improvements.  
1. 	The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a certificate of zoning compliance and the Town­ship Building Official shall not issue a building permit for construction of, or addition to, any one of the above listed buildings or structures until a final site plan has been approved.  A use not involving a building or structure, as above listed, shall not be commenced or ex­
panded, nor shall the Zoning Administrator issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance until a final site plan has been approved. 
2. 	The clearing, grading, and balancing of land may commence absent site plan review if all 
necessary permits have been obtained from the appropriate State or local agencies. The property owner(s) or developer(s) proceed at their own risk despite having a Soil Erosion Permit, due to the fact that subsequent reviews may necessitate modifications to the grades. If deemed necessary, a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Permit shall be obtained from the Eaton County Drain Commissioner. If regulated floodplains and/or wetlands are located on the property, the applicable permits shall be obtained from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

SPECIAL LAND USES 
SECTION 7.01 PURPOSE 
This Ordinance is based upon the division of the Township into districts which permit specified uses by-right that are mutually compatible. It is recognized that there are certain other special uses with unique characteristics, which, due to their actual or potential impacts on neighboring uses or public facilities, need to be more carefully regulated with respect to their location and operation in order to be made fully compatible with those uses that are permitted as of right within a particular district. Accordingly, these special uses can be allowed subject to relevant restrictions or conditions being imposed that address their unique characteristics. 
SECTION 7.02 PROCEDURE 
A. 	Application. An application for a Special Land Use permit shall be submitted to the Zoning Ad­ministrator on a form provided for that purpose.  Each application shall be signed by the property owner and accompanied by all required information and a fee as established by the Township Board, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of a regular meeting of the Planning Com­mission, at which the Special Land Use application will be considered. The following information shall also be submitted: 
1. 	
Five (5) paper copies and a digital PDF format copy of a site plan meeting the requirements of Section 6.02 A.2. 

2. 	
A complete description of the proposed use, and a statement with regard to compliance with the criteria required for approval in Section 7.03 Required Standards and Findings for Making Determinations and any specific standards required by the Ordinance for the 


requested use. 
3. 	Failure to provide the required information and materials as a part of the application for Special Land Use approval shall render the application deficient, and said application shall be held in abeyance until the petitioner submits all required items. The Township Zon­ing Administrator may waive the submission of a site plan where such information is not material to the Planning Commission action, specifically where no physical changes to the site are proposed. 
B. 	Public Hearing. Following submission of the required application materials, the Planning Com­mission shall hold a public hearing on all Special Land Use permit requests in accordance with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, as amended. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the 
manner prescribed by the Act.    
C. 	Planning Commission Action.  At the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall review the application for the Special Land Use and shall recommend approval, denial, or approval with con­ditions. The recommendation of the Planning Commission shall be forwarded to the Township Board for their final consideration.

1. 	
The Township Board shall approve, deny, or approve with conditions the request for Special Land Use. 

2.

2. 	
Compatibility with Adjacent Uses.  The proposed Special Land Use shall be constructed, operated and maintained so as to be compatible with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and so as not to change the essential character of the area in which it is proposed. A Special Land Use shall be designed and constructed so as to not create a significant detrimental impact, as compared to the impacts of permitted uses. 

3. 	
Impact on Public Services.  The proposed Special Land Use shall be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage, water and sewage facilities. Such services shall be provided and accommodated without an unreasonable public burden. 

4. 	
Impact on the Overall Environment.  The proposed Special Land Use shall not involve uses, activities, processes, materials and equipment, or conditions of operation that will be detri­mental to the natural environment, public health, safety, or welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, odors, or other such nuisance in comparison to the im­pacts associated with typical permitted uses. 

5. 	
Traffic Impact.  The proposed Special Land Use shall be located and designed in a manner which will minimize the impact of traffic, taking into consideration: pedestrian access and safety; vehicle trip generation (i.e. volumes); types of traffic, access location and design, circulation and parking design; street and bridge capacity; and traffic operations at nearby intersections and access points. Efforts shall be made to ensure that multiple transportation modes are safely and effectively accommodated in an effort to provide alternate modes of access and alleviate vehicular traffic congestion. The applicant shall comply with the Town­ships Complete Street Ordinance. 







6. 	Operational Characteristics. The nature and character of the activities, processes, materi­als, equipment, or conditions of operation, either specifically or typically associated with 
the use shall be reviewed. 
7. 	
Outdoor Operations. Measures shall be taken to ensure that outdoor activity, storage, and work areas will be compatible with adjacent land uses. 

8. 	
Compliance with Zoning Ordinance Standards.  The proposed Special Land Use shall be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to meet the stated intent of the zoning district and shall comply with all applicable ordinance standards. 

9. 	
Special Land Use Approval Specific Requirements.  The general standards and require­ments of this Section are basic to all uses authorized by Special Land Use approval. The specific and detailed requirements relating to particular uses and area requirements must also be satisfied for those uses.

7.03. A.1. through 9. and the applicable specific use regulations are met. 
2. 	Approval of a Special Land Use, including conditions made as part of the approval, is at­tached to the property described as part of the application and not to the owner of such 
property.  
3. 	
A record of conditions imposed shall be maintained, and shall remain unchanged unless an amendment to the Special Land Use approval is granted. 

4. 	
A record of the decisions, the reasons for the decisions reached and any conditions at­tached to such decision shall be kept and made a part of the minutes of the Planning Com­mission and the Township Board meetings. 

5. 	
The Zoning Administrator may make periodic investigations of developments authorized by Special Land Use permit to determine continued compliance with all requirements im­posed by the Township Board and this Ordinance.  Non-compliance with the requirements 


and stipulations pertaining to the Special Land Use permit shall constitute grounds for the 
Township Board to terminate said approval. 





SECTION 7.05 EFFECTIVENESS 

A. 	Remain in Force. Upon site plan approval by the Zoning Administrator, Special Land Use approval shall continue in force so long as the particular use or activity continues to operate as approved on the approved site, unless otherwise specified in the Township Board resolution of approval.

C. 	Abandonment. Any use for which a Special Land Use permit has been granted and which is discon­tinued for a continuous period of one (1) year or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period shall be considered abandoned and the Special Land Use Permit shall become null and void. Prior to termination of a Special Land Use due to abandonment or discontinuation, the Township Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice of the Townships intent to terminate such use to the property owner identified in the Townships most recent property tax rolls by personal delivery or by first class mail. Said notice shall provide the date, time, and place when the Township Board will hold a public hearing on the question of such abandonment or discontinuance with a final de­termination being made by the Township Board.

Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of this section is to regulate adult use businesses, to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the Township, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult use businesses within the Township.  However, under no circumstances is public nudity, as defined herein, permis­sible in Delta Township. These regulations were created with the understanding that the Town­ship acknowledges that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having deleterious effects upon adjacent residential and commercial areas. The Township recognizes that regulation of adult use businesses is necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of a surrounding residential area and will not negatively impact the health, safety, and general welfare of Township residents. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to adult materials protected by the Constitution of the United States or the Michigan Constitution, or to deny access by the distribu­tors and exhibitors of adult entertainment or adult use businesses to their intended market. It is 





also neither the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene 
material. 
B. 	Special Land Use Approval: The Township Board may impose such conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, or operation of an Adult Use Business, as shall, in its judgment considering the standards set forth in Chapter 7, Special Land Use Standards, be necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, welfare, and interest, except that any conditions imposed on an Adult Use Business as defined in Chapter 2, Definitions, shall be limited to those conditions necessary to assure compliance with the standards and requirements of Section 
8.06 C. 
C. 	Standards: 
1. 	It shall be unlawful to operate an adult use business within five hundred (500) feet, mea­sured from the nearest property line to the nearest property line on a straight line basis, of 
any of the following:

such shielding shall not consist of a curtain alone, shall not obstruct the exit sign or panic hardware for egress from the exit, nor be constructed in such a way as to block the exit, and shall be approved by the Fire Chief. 





SECTION 8.07 AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING AND FOOD STORAGE

future usage and future maintenance of the grounds and structures. 
a. 	Failure of the user or property owner to supply the Zoning Administrator with a plan for the future maintenance, and/or future use of the tower or antenna shall subject 
the tower or antenna to demolition/removal along with restoration of the grounds to the condition which existed prior to the construction of the tower or antenna. The tower or antenna at this point shall be deemed a public nuisance, and a safety hazard, and will be subject to the Dangerous Buildings Ordinance. Demolition/re­moval and restoration of the condition of the property to that which existed prior to the construction of the tower or antenna may then proceed in compliance with the Dangerous Building Ordinance. If, after notification of the Townships intent to 
demolish or remove and restore the tower or antenna pursuant to the Dangerous Buildings Ordinance, the tower or antenna has not been removed within sixty (60) 
days of the applicable deadline, and after at least thirty (30) days written notice, 
the Township may remove or secure the removal of the tower or antenna with its 





actual costs and reasonable administration charges to be billed directly to the 
property owner and/or user of the tower or antenna.  The property owner or 
tower/antenna user shall be responsible for demolition, removal, and restoring the condition of the property to that which existed prior to the construction of the tower or antenna, as well as any costs and attorney fees incurred by the Township 
in securing the removal. 
b. 	Notwithstanding the requirement of a written plan for future use and mainte­nance, if at any time the Township should determine that the tower or antenna 
or its grounds has become a public nuisance or a safety hazard, the tower or an­tenna and/or its grounds shall be subject to the Townships Dangerous Building Ordinance. 
13. 	Co-location: If co-location is proposed in which the antenna is attached to an existing building, structure, light/utility pole, or water tower, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for Site Plan approval and the Special Land Use Permit requirement shall be waived. 
a. 	Height: The antenna shall not extend more than thirty (30) feet above the high­est point of the structure. An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed thirty (30) feet over the towers existing height, to replace the tower or to accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna. The height change may only occur one (1) time per communication tower. 
b. 	State & Federal Requirements: All towers and antennas shall meet the standards 
of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission and any other agency of the State of Michigan or federal government with author­ity to regulate towers and antennas.

CHAPTER 10 
ROADS, TRAFFIC & SIDEWALKS 
SECTION 10.01 	WEST SAGINAW HIGHWAY (M-43) ACCESS MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS 
A. 	Applicability & Intent. The regulations and standards of this Section shall apply to all properties along West Saginaw Highway (M-43), which is a regional arterial street, with the intent of optimiz­ing through-traffic operations and improving public safety along West Saginaw Highway (M-43) by minimizing congestion and accident potential, while still providing property owners with reason­able access. The Eaton County Road Commission and the Michigan Department of Transportation have jurisdiction over the public roads in Delta Township. The construction and maintenance of the public roads are subject to the requirements of these agencies.  The requirements and stan­dards of this Section shall be applied in addition to, and where permissible, shall supersede the requirements of the Michigan Department of Transportation, Eaton County Road Commission, or other requirements of this ordinance. Any project involving the construction or reconstruction of a roadway shall also be subject to the provisions of the Delta Township Complete Streets Ordi­nance. 
B. 	Exceptions. It is recognized that existing development may not be able to meet all the standards contained in this Section upon expansion or redevelopment. In such cases, the standards con­tained herein shall be applied to the maximum extent possible.  Where the standards herein can­not be met, suitable alternatives, documented by a registered traffic engineer, and substantially achieving the intent of the chapter may be accepted by the Zoning Administrator, provided that all of the following apply: 
1. 	
The use will generate less than five hundred (500) vehicle trips per day, based on rates developed by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 

2. 	
The use has insufficient size to meet the dimensional standards. 

3. 	
Adjacent development renders adherence to these standards economically unfeasible. 

4. 	
There is no other reasonable access. 


C. 	General Access Requirements. The following standards shall apply to all uses with frontage on or access to West Saginaw Highway (M-43) which require Site Plan Review.  Approval of a site plan by the Township and compliance with these standards does not negate the requirement for securing access permits from the appropriate road authority, either the Michigan Department of Transpor­
tation or the Eaton County Road Commission, following site plan approval by the Township. 
1. 	Number of Driveways. 
a. 	Access to West Saginaw Highway (M-43) for an individual parcel or to contiguous 





parcels under the same ownership, shall consist of either a single two-way driveway or a paired driveway system wherein one (1) driveway is designed, and appropri­
ately marked, to accommodate ingress traffic and the other egress traffic.  
b. 	
For developments that can demonstrate that their combined driveway approach volumes (entering and exiting) will exceed three thousand (3,000) vehicle trips dur­ing an average day (or will be used by three hundred (300) vehicles during the peak hour of traffic for either West Saginaw Highway (M-43) or the use), and lacking ac­cess to a secondary street, a second driveway may be allowed along West Saginaw Highway (M-43), provided that the additional driveway can meet the spacing stan­dards of Section 10.01 F. Driveway Spacing and Location. 

c. 	
For parcels with West Saginaw Highway (M-43) frontage of at least three hundred 

(300) feet an additional driveway may be allowed, with another driveway allowed for each three hundred (300) feet of frontage thereafter, provided that these drive­ways meet the standards of Section 10.01 F. Driveway Spacing and Location. 

d. 	
Where parcels have dual frontage on both a side (cross) street and West Saginaw Highway (M-43), access may be required to be provided solely off the secondary 


street.  If the parcel has a minimum of three hundred (300) feet of frontage on West 
Saginaw Highway (M-43), additional access may be allowed along West Saginaw Highway (M-43), provided that the access meets the standards of Section 10.01 F. Driveway Spacing and Location. 
D. 	Shared Driveways, Frontage Roads, Parking Lot Connections, and Rear Service Drives. 
1. Alternative access shall be encouraged.  One (1) or more of the following may apply. 
a. 	Shared Driveways. Sharing or joint use of a driveway by two (2) or more property owners shall be encouraged.  In cases where access is restricted by the driveway spacing requirements of Section 10.01 F. Driveway Spacing and Location, a shared driveway may be the only access design allowed.  The shared driveway shall be 
constructed along the midpoint between the two (2) properties unless a written easement is provided which allows traffic to travel across one(1) parcel to access another, and/or access the public street. 
b. 	Frontage Roads.  Where a frontage road exists or is proposed on an approved site plan for an adjoining lot or parcel, access shall be provided via the frontage road, rather than by direct connection to West Saginaw Highway, when reasonably pos­sible. 
c. 	Parking Lot Connections. Where a proposed parking lot is adjacent to an existing parking lot of a similar use, there shall be a vehicular connection between the two 
(2) parking lots where possible, as determined by the Zoning Administrator. For 
developments adjacent to vacant properties, the site shall be designed to provide for a future connection.

TABLE 10.01-F.2.  DRIVEWAY SPACING ALONG SIDE STREETS INTERSECTING WITH 

WEST SAGINAW HIGHWAY (M-43) 

c. 	If the amount of street frontage is not sufficient to meet the above criterion, the driveway shall be constructed along the property line farthest from the intersection to encourage future shared use, and/or a frontage road or rear access service drive shall be developed. 
d. 	For parcels which are only allowed a channelized right-turn-in, right-turn-out driveway, and alternative means of access (shared driveway, frontage road, service drive or connected parking lots) are not feasible due to parcel size or existing ad­jacent development, the Zoning Administrator may allow a non-channelized, full 
movement driveway provided that: 




i. 	The driveway is spaced no closer to the intersection than the minimum spacing allowed for a right-turn-in, right-turn-out driveway. 
ii. 	A traffic study, conducted by a registered traffic engineer, provides substan­tial justification that the driveway operation will not result in conflicts with vehicles at the adjacent intersection. 
2. 	Driveway Spacing from Other Driveways (refer to Figure 10.01-F.1.) 
a. 	There shall be a minimum spacing of twenty-five (25) feet between the centerline of a driveway and the adjacent property line, not including the right-turn lane and/or taper.  The centerline for channelized driveways is measured at the street right-of-way line. This requirement does not apply to shared driveways. 
b. 	If a driveway curb radius extends beyond the frontage of the property, written consent from the affected adjacent property owner(s) allowing the design shall be 
provided, as required by the road authority. 
c. 	Minimum driveway spacing requirements shall be determined based on posted speed limits along the parcel frontage, as indicated in Table 10.01-F.3. Driveway spacing shall be measured from the centerline of each driveway.  The distances in Table 10.01-F.3. are considered minimums based on the distances required to 
avoid conflicts between vehicles turning right or left from adjacent driveways. 
TABLE 10.01-F.3.  MINIMUM SPACING BETWEEN DRIVEWAYS 

d. 	
In order to prevent left-turn conflicts, where possible driveways shall be aligned with those across the street or offset a sufficient distance from driveways across the street, in accordance with the minimum spacing standards listed in Table 10.01-F.3. 

e. 	
In the case of expansion, alteration, or redesign of an existing development where it can be demonstrated that pre-existing conditions prohibit adherence to the 


minimum driveway spacing standards, the Zoning Administrator shall have the 




authority to modify the driveway spacing requirements. Such modifications shall 
be of the minimum amount necessary, but in no case shall driveway spacing of less than sixty (60) feet be permitted by the Zoning Administrator. 
G. 	Driveway Design and Construction Standards. 
1. 	Driveway Width. 
a. 	The typical driveway design shall include one (1) ingress lane and one (1) egress lane with a combined maximum throat width of thirty (30) feet, measured from face to face of curb (see Figure 10.01-G.1.a.). 
b. 	Where exit traffic volumes are expected to exceed one thousand (1,000) vehicles per day, one hundred (100) vehicles per peak hour, or in areas where congestion along West Saginaw Highway (M-43) may create significant delays, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, two (2) exit lanes shall be required.  The total width of such a driveway shall be thirty-seven (37) feet, with one (1) fifteen (15)-foot wide in­gress lane and two (2) eleven (11)-foot wide egress lanes (see Figure 10.01-G.1.b.). 
c. 	For access systems which include a pair of one-way driveways, each driveway shall be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet wide, measured perpendicularly (see Figure 10.01-G.1.c.). 
d. 	As an alternative to paragraph c. above, the driveway may be designed with a me­dian dividing the ingress and egress driveways, with a maximum median width of ten (10) feet.  Where median driveways are located across the street from each other, the left-turn egress lanes shall be aligned to minimize left turn conflicts (See Figure 10.01-G.1.d.). Boulevard driveways should not be constructed at existing or future traffic signal locations. 






FIGURE 10.01-G.1. TYPICAL CONFIGURATIONS FOR DRIVEWAYS 







2. 	Restricted Access Driveways. Left- and right-turn movements on and off roadways typically have the greatest impact on traffic flow and accident frequency. Therefore, where drive­ways are proposed in areas which have a high accident rate or significant traffic congestion/ delays, or where left-turn access is available through alternative means of access, the Zoning Administrator may require driveway design and signing which discourages certain turning movements. Where driveways are intended to control specific left- and/or right-turn in­gress and egress, the designs shown in Figure 10.01-G.2. shall apply. Similar designs shall be accepted, provided that they are approved by the Michigan Department of Transportation 
and the Eaton County Road Commission, if applicable. 






FIGURE 10.01-G.2. CHANNELIZATION ISLAND OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING TURNS 






3. Construction Standards. 
a. 
Curb Radii. 

i. 	Driveways shall be designed with minimum twenty-five (25)-foot radii where primarily passenger vehicle traffic is expected. 
ii. 	For sites where truck traffic is expected, the driveways shall be designed with minimum thirty (30)-foot radii. 

b. 
Deceleration Lanes & Tapers. 


i. 	Where it can be demonstrated that daily driveway volumes are expected to exceed one thousand (1,000) vehicles per day or where volumes on the street are over the capacity (level of service D, as defined by the Institute of Transpor­tation Engineers), a right-turn taper, deceleration lane and/or left-turn bypass 
lane may be required. 
ii. 	Where site frontage allows, a twelve (12)-foot wide deceleration lane with a fif­ty (50)- to seventy-five (75)-foot taper and a minimum one hundred (100)-foot 
long parallel storage lane shall be constructed as shown in Figure 10.01-G.3.a. 
iii. 	Where the amount of frontage precludes the construction of a deceleration lane and taper combination entirely within the property lines of a parcel, a re­quest shall be made to the owner of the adjacent parcel to allow the installation of a right-turn bay and taper which extends beyond the property line.  If per­mission cannot be obtained from the adjacent property owner for an extension onto that parcel, a taper of at least seventy-five (75) feet shall be constructed as shown in Figure 10.01-G.3.b. 
iv. 	A continuous right-turn lane, as shown in Figure 10.01-G.3.c. may be required where driveway spacing requirements restrict the use of consecutive turn bays 
and tapers. 
v. 	For driveways located along streets without an exclusive left-turn lane, a bypass lane may be required. Such a lane shall be designed to the standards set forth in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and as shown in Fig­ure 10.01-G.3.d. 






FIGURE 10.01-G.3. DECELERATION LANES AND TAPERS 







c. 	Grades and Drainage. 
i. 	Driveways shall be constructed such that the grade for the twenty-five (25) feet nearest the pavement edge or shoulder does not exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%), where feasible.  In no case shall the driveway grade between the pavement edge and right-of-way exceed seven percent (7%).  The driveway grade thereafter shall not exceed the values in Table 10.01-G.1.

ii. 	Vertical curves, with a minimum length of fifteen (15) feet shall be provided on driveway approaches at a change in grade of four percent (4%) or more. 
iii. 	Driveways shall be constructed such that drainage from impervious areas lo­cated outside of the public right-of-way, which are determined to be in excess 
of existing drainage from these areas shall not be discharged into the highway 
drainage system absent the approval of the responsible agency. 
d. 	Surface and Curb Construction. Driveways shall be constructed of a permanent asphalt or concrete material and shall be paved and curbed from the edge of pave­ment to either the right-of-way line or point of curvature of the radius returns. 
e. 	Maintenance of Directional Signs and Pavement Markings.  In order to ensure 
smooth traffic circulation on the site, direction signs and pavement markings shall 
be installed at the driveway(s) as required by the Township as part of the site plan 
review process and approved by the Michigan Department of Transportation and 
Eaton County Road Commission, and shall be maintained on a permanent basis by the property owner. 
H. 	Design of Frontage Roads or Service Drives 
1. 	Frontage roads and service drives required by other sections of this ordinance shall be con­structed to the following standards: 
a. 	Frontage roads and service drives shall be designed at a width of thirty (30) to thir­ty-six (36) feet, measured face-to-face of curb with an approach width of thirty-nine 


(39) feet at intersections. 



b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

g. 


Frontage road and service drive intersections shall be designed according to the same minimum standards as described for driveways in Section 10.01 G. 
Frontage roads shall have a minimum setback of thirty (30) feet from the right­of-way with a minimum of sixty (60) feet of storage at the intersection for en­tering and exiting vehicles as measured from the pavement edge (see Figure 10.01-H.1.a.). At driveways where it can be demonstrated that traffic volumes will exceed one thousand (1,000) vehicle trips per day, a minimum of eighty (80) feet of stacking space shall be required. 
The frontage road intersections shall be located a minimum distance of one hun­dred fifty (150) feet from the centerline of the nearest intersecting public street, as shown in Figure 10.01-H.1.a. 
Intersections for rear access service drives should be located at least three hun­dred (300) feet from the street that the adjacent buildings have frontage on, as shown in Figure 10.01-H.1.b. 
Parking shall be prohibited along two-way frontage roads and service drives that are constructed at the minimum thirty (30)-foot width.  One-way roads or two-
way roads designed with additional width for parallel parking may be allowed if it can be demonstrated through traffic studies that on-street parking will not sig­nificantly affect the capacity, safety, or operation of the frontage road or service drive.  Perpendicular or angle parking along either side of a designated frontage road or service drive shall be prohibited. 
In the case of expansion, alteration, or redesign of existing development where it can be demonstrated that pre-existing conditions prohibit installation of a front­age road or service drive in accordance with the aforementioned standards, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to allow alternative cross access between adjacent parking areas through the interconnection of main circulation aisles. Under these conditions, the aisles serving the parking stalls shall be aligned 
perpendicularly to the access aisle, as shown in Figure 10.01-H.1.c., with islands, curbing and/or signage to further delineate the edges of the route to be used by 
through traffic.

SECTION 10.03 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES 
A. 	Intent. Delta Township recognizes the direct correlation between land development and traffic operations. The intent of this section is to permit accurate evaluation of expected impacts of a proposed project to assist in decision-making. This section is further intended to help achieve the following objectives: 
1. 	
Provide a standard set of analytic tools and a format for preparing traffic impact studies. 

2. 	
Allow the Township to assess the effects that a proposed project may have on the com­munity by outlining information needed and evaluation procedures to be used. 

3. 	
Help ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on streets and intersections after development of the proposed project. 

4. 	
Reduce the negative traffic impacts created by individual developments by helping to en­sure that the transportation system can safely and efficiently accommodate the projected traffic increases. 

5. 	
Realize a comprehensive approach to the overall impacts of various developments along a corridor or within part of the Township rather than a piecemeal approach. 

6. 	
Provide direction to Township decision makers, transportation agencies, and developers of the expected impacts of a project. 

7. 	
Alert the Township, transportation agencies, and developers of improvements or modifi­cations needed to the roadway, access, or site design. 

8. 	
Protect the substantial public investment in the existing street system. 


B. 	Applicability. 
1. 	A traffic impact study shall be required and shall be submitted by a petitioner for rezon­ing, special land use permit, site plan review, or condominium subdivision requests which could generate at least one hundred (100) directional trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator, or the peak hour on the adjacent streets, or over one thousand (1,000) 
trips in an average day. 





2. 	Forecasted trip generation shall be based upon equations/rates outlined in the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual or other authoritative studies available. 
C. 	Study Area Determination. The Zoning Administrator and the applicant shall meet to determine the study area boundaries.  Other issues which shall be discussed include the availability of data, background rates to be used, horizon (design) year, acceptable trip generation rates and reduction factors, trip distribution, as well as the need to evaluate other issues. Generally the larger the proj­ect, the larger the study area will be and the more detailed the traffic study will be. 
D. 	Traffic Impact Study Contents. 
1. 	
Description of the Site and Surroundings. Illustrations and a narrative shall describe the characteristics of the site and adjacent roadway system (functional classification, lanes, speed limits, etc.). This description shall include surrounding land uses, expected develop­ment in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site features, and a description of any committed roadway improvements. 

2. 	
Description of the Requested Zoning or Use. 


a. 	For a rezoning request, a general description of the proposed use shall be provided.

quests, a description of factors including, but not limited to: the number and types of dwelling units; the gross and usable floor area; and the number of employees shall be provided.  Any intended phasing or potential expansion shall be noted. 
3. 	Description of Traffic Conditions. 
a. 	Traffic Counts. Describe existing conditions including existing daily and peak hour traffic volumes on adjacent streets(s) and intersections in the vicinity which are ex­pected to be impacted. Traffic count data shall not be over two (2) years old, ex­cept the Zoning Administrator may permit twenty-four (24) hour counts up to three 
(3) years old to be increased by a factor supported by documentation that traffic 
has increased at a rate of no more than two percent (2%) in the past three (3) to 
five (5) years. Traffic counts shall be taken Monday through Friday on non-holiday weeks under normal driving conditions. Additional counts (i.e. on a Saturday for a 
proposed commercial development) may also be required in some cases.  The indi­
vidual preparing the impact study shall obtain the traffic counts during average or higher than average volume conditions for the area under study. 
b. 	Roadway Characteristics. Roadway characteristics shall be described and illustrated, as appropriate. Features to be addressed include lane configurations, geometrics, signal timing traffic control devices, posted speed limits, average running speeds, gaps in the traffic flow, and any sight distance limitations.

forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined in the most recent 
edition of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or other authoritative studies available. 
b. 	
When a traffic study is required for a rezoning request, the study shall contrast the traffic impacts of the proposed use, or of a typical use permitted in the requested zoning district, with uses permitted in the current zoning district. 

c. 	
Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ride-sharing, other modes, internal capture rates, etc. shall be based both on ITE recommendations and documenta­tion for the specific uses. 


d. 	For projects intended to be developed in phases, the trip generation phase shall be described in order to determine the need for improvements at the various stages of development. 
Trip Distribution. The projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound v. out­bound, left-turn v. right-turn) onto the existing street network to project turning move­ments at site access points and nearby intersections where required. Projected turning movements shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the application of standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution shall also be attached (gravity model, market studies, counts at existing driveways, etc.). For projects of regional signifi­cance, a network model projection may be required. 
Impact Analysis. 
a. 	For any project with a completion date beyond one (1) year at the time of the traffic study, the analysis shall also include a scenario analyzing forecasted traffic at date of completion along the adjacent street network using a forecast based 
on a network model (if available), historic annual percentage increases, and/or on expected development in the area. Traffic impact assessments shall acknowledge the traffic impacts of other uses approved, but not yet constructed, which may 





7. 
8. 

9. 


affect traffic operations for the subject site as determined by the Zoning Administra­tor. 
b.  The impact study shall include capacity analysis (level of service) at the proposed access points using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the High­way Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board. Before and after capacity analyses shall also be performed at all street intersections where the expected traffic generated at the site will comprise at least five percent (5%) of the existing intersection capacity, and/or for roadway sections and intersections experi­encing congestion or a relatively high accident rate, as determined by the applicable road agency.  
c.  The impact study shall include gap studies for un-signalized intersections.  
d.  The Township may require that the impact of the street network be evaluated for a project of regional significance if a network model is available.  

Access Design/Access Management Standards. The impact study shall include a map and description of the location and design of proposed access (driveways or new street inter­sections), including any sight distance limitations, dimensions from adjacent driveways, and intersections within three hundred fifty (350) feet on either side of the main roadway, other 
data to demonstrate that the design and number of access points proposed will provide safe 
and efficient traffic operation and be in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance and 
the standards of the applicable road agency. 

Other Study Items. 
a. 	The traffic impact study shall describe the need for, or provision of, any additional right-of-way where required. 
b. 	The study shall note changes which should be considered to the site plan layout. 
c. 	The study shall include a description of any non-motorized facilities. 
d. 	
If the use involves a drive-thru facility, the adequacy of the queuing (stacking) area shall be evaluated. 

e. 	
If a median crossover is desired, separate analysis shall be provided. 


f. 	If a traffic signal is being requested, the relationship of anticipated traffic to traffic signal warrants in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devises shall be reviewed. Analysis shall also be provided on the impacts to traffic progression along the roadway through coordinated timing, etc. 
Mitigation/Alternatives. The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements shall be described. The mitigation measures may include items such as roadway widening, need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access management techniques or a reduction in the proposed inten­sity of use. Any mitigation measure shall include correspondence from the applicable road agency.  The responsibility for and timing of roadway improvements shall be described. 





10. 	Preparers Qualifications. A required traffic impact study shall be prepared under the direction of a traffic/transportation engineer registered in Michigan (PE) with a history of completing impact studies and other traffic engineering analyses. The preparers resume 
shall accompany the study. 
E. 	Submittal. 
1. 	
A traffic impact study shall be submitted at the time an application is filed for a rezoning, special land use permit, condominium subdivision, and/or a site plan. 

2. 	
The Township shall distribute the traffic impact study to the appropriate road agencies. A copy shall also be submitted to the Tri-Regional Planning Commission for projects of regional significance. 

3. 	
The road agencies shall provide the Township with comments prior to any action on the 


project. The Zoning Administrator shall review and comment on the traffic impact study and prepare a report for the Planning Commission. 
F. 	Appeals. Appeals for a waiver from the requirement of a traffic impact study shall be made to the Township Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the procedures contained in the Zoning Board of Appeals Chapter herein.  Factors which the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider when reviewing a variance request include: 
1. 	
Are roadway improvements scheduled which are expected to mitigate any impacts associ­ated with the proposed project? 

2. 	
Is the existing level of service along the roadway not expected to drop to level C due to the proposed project? 

3. 	
Is the existing level of service not expected to be significantly impacted by the proposed project due to specific conditions at the subject location? 

4. 	
Has a similar traffic study been previously prepared for the site and is it still considered applicable? 


SECTION 10.04 SIDEWALKS 
Sidewalks shall be installed along all public and private roads as required by the Delta Charter Township Code of Ordinances, as amended. In addition, all sidewalks shall meet the following standards of develop­ment:

CHAPTER 11 
OFF-STREET PARKING 



SECTION 11.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS 
A. 	Scope of Regulations. 
1. 	At the time any building or structure is erected, enlarged or increased in capacity, or uses or occupancy established or changed, off-street parking shall be provided in all zoning 
districts according to the requirements of this Chapter. 
2. 	
No parking space which exists at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance shall thereaf­ter be relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements established by this Chapter, except as provided for in Section 11.01 C.8. 

3. 	
Parking areas must have the same zoning classification as the property on which the prin­cipal use is located which they are serving. 


B. 	Location of Parking. Off-street parking facilities required by this Chapter shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the use for which the parking is required or on an abutting lot or parcel under the same ownership. This requirement does not apply to joint parking facilities developed in ac­
cordance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
1. 	
One and Two-Family Dwellings. The off-street parking facilities required for single- and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the building they are intended to serve, but shall not be considered a parking facility under the provisions of this Chapter. 

2. 	
All Other Uses. Off-street parking facilities, other than single- and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the building or buildings they are intended to 


serve, and within five hundred (500) feet of the main entrance of the building intended to be served, unless otherwise modified by the Zoning Administrator. 
C. 	Units and Methods of Measurement. 
1. 	Floor Area. Where floor area is the unit for determining the required number of off-street parking spaces, said unit shall mean the gross floor area, except as noted in Section 11.01 
C.2. 
2. 	Where the floor area measurement is specified as net floor area, parking requirements shall apply to all building areas except that floor area used for incidental service, storage, installations of mechanical equipment, heating systems, and similar uses and other areas 
where service to the general public is not provided.  For buildings where use areas are not 
yet defined, the gross floor area may be reduced by fifteen percent (15%) for calculating 





3. 
4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8. 


net floor area. When use areas are defined, the actual net floor area shall be used to com­pute parking requirements. 
Places of Assembly. In stadiums, sports arenas, churches, and other places of assembly 
in which any portion of the seating consists of benches, pews, or other such seating each twenty-four (24) inches of such seating shall be counted as one (1) seat. In cases where a place of assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be com­puted separately for each type and added together. 
Employees. For requirements stated in terms of employees, the calculation shall be based 
upon the maximum number of employees likely to be on the premises during the largest 
shift. 
Fractions.  When units of measurement determining the number of required parking spaces 
result in a fractional space, any fraction shall be counted as one (1) additional space. 
Off-Street Parking Requirements. 
a.  New Uses or Buildings. The amount of required off-street parking spaces for new uses shall be in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 11.03 except for adjustments made to reflect the maximum permitted parking in Section 11.01 C.7., permitted parking reductions in Section 11.01 C.8., and shared parking in Section 11.02.  
b.  Similar Uses and Requirements. When a use is not specifically listed in Section 11.03, the requirements of off-street parking for a similar use shall apply as deter­ 
mined by the Zoning Administrator.  

Maximum Permitted Parking.  The number of parking spaces provided on any development site, with the exception of single-family residential developments, schools, colleges, child care centers, hospitals, and places of worship and assembly, shall not exceed the minimum 
standards of this Chapter by more than twenty percent (20%). This limitation is intended to limit excess amounts of impervious surface which result in increased stormwater run-off, prevent the unwarranted conversion of green space to paved areas, and promote improved 
aesthetics. 
Permitted Parking Reductions. The Zoning Administrator may permit a reduction from the parking standards in this chapter, not to exceed twenty percent (20%). The reduction shall be subject to the following: 
a. 	
An applicant may request a parking reduction at any time, as part of a current site plan, special land use, or rezoning application, or may request a reduction as a sepa­rate and distinct action with no other concurrent request. 

b. 	
The applicant shall provide a parking study with adequate information to assist the Zoning Administrator in determining the appropriateness of the request. 

c. 	
Sufficient area shall be reserved on the subject parcel to meet the minimum parking 







standard if required by the Zoning Administrator in the future. The reserved area shall be suitable for development and not possess characteristics such as exces­sive slope, poor soils, wetlands, etc. 
d. 	The Zoning Administrator may attach conditions to the approval of a parking re­duction that bind such approval to the specific use in question. 
e. 	All of the parking spaces, including the spaces installed initially as well as those installed at a later date, shall comply with all applicable standards herein includ­ing, but not limited to, dimensions, setbacks, landscaping, buffer strips, access aisles, etc. 
f. 	At any time following the approval of a site plan permitting a parking reduction, the Zoning Administrator may require that the additional parking be provided. The actions necessitating the additional parking would include, but not be limited to: unauthorized parking on adjacent properties; traffic congestion resulting from 
a lack of parking; a building expansion; and/or a change in land use on the subject parcel.  The Zoning Administrator shall provide the property owner with docu­
mentation substantiating the need for the additional parking. 
SECTION 11.02 MIXED USE/SHARED PARKING FACILITIES 
A. 	Shared Parking for Separate Parcels. The Zoning Administrator may approve shared parking for 
separate parcels subject to the following conditions: 
1. 	The following documentation shall be provided by all parties participating in a shared parking arrangement: 
a. 	
A description of the land uses identifying their respective peak parking demands. 

b. 	
The hours of operation and the days of the week during which each use operates. 

c. 	
The location of the parking area intended for joint use and its proximity to the uses. 

d. 	
An analysis of the potential impact a joint parking area would have on the sur­rounding area, particularly residential neighborhoods. 


2. 	
A signed and notarized agreement shall be provided by the property owners acknowl­edging their consent to the shared parking arrangement.  The signed agreement shall be recorded at the Eaton County Register of Deeds Office for each parcel. 

3. 	
To demonstrate shared parking compatibility, the applicants shall use a recognized indus­try standard such as the Urban Land Institutes Shared Parking Report. The underlying parking requirements for each use shall be based on the parking requirements in Section 

11.03. 

4. 	
Sufficient area shall be reserved to provide the required parking for all of the individual uses computed separately on each parcel in the event that one party abrogates/with­







draws from the agreement. Should the shared parking agreement be withdrawn by either 
party, the Zoning Administrator shall mandate that each property provide the parking as required herein. 
B. 	Shared Parking for Mixed Use Developments on the Same Parcel. Shared parking for Mixed Use De­velopments on the same parcel may be reduced by the Zoning Administrator, as set forth in Section 
11.01 C.8., subject to the following requirements: 
1. 	The following documentation shall be provided for the Mixed Use Development: 
a. 	
A description of the land uses identifying their respective peak parking demands. 

b. 	
The hours of operation and days of the week during which each use operates. 

c. 	
An analysis of the potential impact shared parking would have on the surrounding area, particularly residential neighborhoods. 


2. 	To demonstrate shared parking compatibility, the applicant shall use a recognized industry standard such as the Urban Land Institute Shared Parking Report. Underlying parking space requirements for each use shall be based on the parking requirements outlined in Section 
11.03. 
3. 	Sufficient area shall be reserved to provide the required parking for all of the individual uses computed separately on the property in the event that one (1) party abrogates/withdraws 
from the agreement. Should the shared parking agreement be withdrawn by either party, 
the Zoning Administrator shall mandate that each property provide the parking as required herein.

CHAPTER 12 


SITE DESIGN STANDARDS 
SECTION 12.01 INTENT 
It is the intent of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and improve the site design and visual appearance of the Township by requiring consistent standards for such site elements as land­scaping, refuse, and recycling receptacles, equipment screening, and lighting. 

SECTION 12.02 LANDSCAPING 
A. 	Purpose. Landscaping is the organization of outdoor space and shall be treated as an important design element.  The landscape plan shall be designed to achieve the following purposes: 
1. 	
To preserve and enhance the identity or character of the site. 

2. 	
To screen or filter views, buffer incompatible land uses, and blend inharmonious land uses. 

3. 	
To integrate and unify various parts of the site. 

4. 	
To improve the local environment by controlling soil erosion; moderating harsh or un­pleasant sounds; removing air pollutants; controlling light trespass and reflection; moder­ating winds and the effects of climate; and promoting stormwater infiltration. 

5. 	
To preserve and enhance existing environmental systems and wildlife habitat, including woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands. 


B. 	Landscape Plan. A separate, detailed landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the site plan review as set forth in Chapter 6. 
C. 	General Landscaping Requirements. 
1. 	Plant materials shall be of generally acceptable varieties and species, free from insects and diseases, and hardy to Eaton County. Artificial plant materials cannot be used to meet the 
landscaping requirements herein. 
2. 	A mixture of live plant materials, such as evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs, is 
required as a protective measure against insect and disease infestation. One (1) species 
shall not exceed thirty-three percent (33%) of the total number of trees or shrubs. 
3. 	All parts of a site that will not be covered by buildings or other structures, streets, parking 
lots, or other paved areas, or planting beds, shall be stabilized with grass or ground covers. 
Margins between sidewalks and streets, islands in parking lots, medians in boulevards, streets, or driveways and similar areas shall be landscaped.  The surfaces of islands and medians shall be stabilized with grass, ground covers, and/or low growing shrubs. The use 





D. 
E. 
F. 
G. 
H. 
of mulch as the sole ground cover is prohibited.  The use of small diameter loose stone shall be minimized since it can trespass into drains and public streets. 
Coordination with Utilities. Landscape installers shall make provisions to coordinate with existing and proposed underground and overhead utility lines so as to avoid interference with plant growth and so as not to damage any utility or interrupt any utility service. 
Existing Plantings. The preservation and incorporation of existing plant materials in a landscape plan is encouraged.  The Zoning Administrator may credit existing plant materials so as to meet the minimum landscaping requirements herein. 
Stormwater Retention and Detention Ponds.  The installation of stormwater management systems including bio-swales, rain gardens, and retention and detention ponds in the overall landscape is encouraged. Stormwater management systems replicating natural design and appearance are also encouraged. Detention/retention areas shall be permitted within buffer zones provided they do not hamper the screening intent of the buffer or jeopardize the survival of plant materials. The installa­tion and use of stormwater retention and detention ponds shall be constructed and regulated as per the applicable standards of the Eaton County Drain Commissioners Office. 
Installation, Maintenance, and Completion of Landscaping. 
1. 	
All landscaping required by this Ordinance shall be planted prior to occupancy, or the sub­mission of the appropriate financial surety as required in Sections 3.03 and/or 3.05. 

2. 	
Plant materials shall be installed in such a manner so as not to negatively impact drainage patterns on site or on adjacent properties or to obstruct vision for traffic movements. 

3. 	
Failure to install and maintain approved landscaping shall constitute a violation of this Or­dinance. 


Buffer Zones Required. 
1. 	The use of physical barriers and landscape screening within buffer zones is to provide for the transition from one (1) zoning district to another contrasting zoning district. This practice promotes compatibility between land uses; preserves the character of existing residential 
neighborhoods; and helps protect property values. 
a. 	
A landscape screen or a physical barrier such as a wall or fence within a buffer zone shall be installed on the property to be developed in order to create a visual screen along all adjoining boundaries as set forth in Table 12.02-H.1. 

b. 	
A landscape screen or a physical barrier within a buffer zone shall be required on the property to be developed, even if the adjacent property is unimproved or vacant land. 

c. 	
If a developed property changes to a more intense land use, a landscape screen or physical barrier within a buffer zone shall be installed on the property as set forth in Table 12.02-H.1. 







2. 	Buffer Zone Matrix.  Table 12.02-H.1. specifies the required buffer zone type required to be installed on the subject site to be developed based on the sites zoning classification and that of adjacent land. The zoning classification of the subject site is indicated in the left column of the table. The zoning classification of adjacent land is indicated across the 
top of the table.

3. 	Requirements for Plantings within Buffer Zones. 
a. 	The minimum size and maximum spacing of the plantings shall be as specified in Table 12.02-L.1. 
b. 	
The width of the landscaped area and the density of plantings shall be as specified in the requirements for Buffer Zones A, B, and C herein. 

c. 	
Any one (1) species of the required trees may not exceed thirty-three percent (33%) of the total number of required trees. 


d. 	
Plants shall typically be arranged in a staggered pattern to create a continuous screen. 

e. 	
Existing vegetation on the property to be developed, which is within the required landscaped area, may be credited toward meeting the screening requirement by the Zoning Administrator if the vegetation is healthy and meets the size and type requirements of Table 12.02-L.1. 


4. 	Requirements for Berms within Buffer Zones. 
a. 	Berms shall be installed with slopes not to exceed a one to three (1:3) ratio. Berms shall generally have a flat top which is at least two (2) feet wide. 




b. 	Berm height shall be measured from the nearest adjacent top of the curb (parking 
lot), or nearest adjacent crown of the road, or the nearest adjacent finished first floor elevation; whichever is higher. Uniform berm heights and shapes should be avoided. 
c. 	Berm slopes shall be protected with sod, seed, or other forms of natural ground cover.  Berms shall be constructed in such a manner so as not to alter drainage pat­
terns on-site or on adjacent properties, or obstruct motorists vision. 
d. 	If a berm is constructed with a retaining wall or by terracing, the earthen slope shall face the exterior of the site. 
5. 	Requirements for Walls or Fences within Buffer Zones. 
a. 	Required screen walls and fences shall be constructed with new, durable, weather 
resistant materials.  Chain-link and barbed-wire fences shall not be permitted. 
b. 	The wall or fence may be constructed with openings that do not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the wall surface.  The openings shall not reduce the intended ob­
scuring effect of the wall. 
c. 	Screen walls or fences shall not be constructed so as to alter drainage on site or adjacent properties or obstruct motorists vision. 
6. 	Buffer Zone Widths and Development Standards. 
a. 	Minimum Required Buffer Zone Widths. Buffer Zone A shall have a minimum width of fifty (50) feet. Buffer Zone B shall have a minimum width of thirty (30) feet. Buffer 
Zone C shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet. 
b. 	Buffer Zone Development Standards. 
i. 	The buffer zone shall contain one (1) tree for each thirty (30) linear feet or frac­tion of buffer zone length. At least one-half (0.5) of the total number of trees required within the buffer zone shall be deciduous trees. 
ii. 	The buffer zone shall contain a three (3)-foot high screen comprised of plant material, berming, screen walls and/or fences, or any combination of these ele­ments. 
iii. 	If berming is used for all or part of the buffer zone screen, the berm shall con­tain a minimum of one (1) shrub for each ten (10) linear feet or fraction of berm 
length.  All required plant material shall be placed on the top and exterior side slope of the berm. 
iv. 	If a screen wall or fence is used for all or part of the buffer zone screen, a mini­mum of one (1) shrub for each ten (10) linear feet or fraction of wall or fence shall be placed on the exterior side of the wall or fence. 





v. 	If shrubs are used for all or part of the required buffer zone screen, the screen shall consist of a minimum of one (1) shrub for each five (5) linear feet or frac­tion of screen length. 
vi. All applicable standards in Table 12.02-L.1. shall be complied with. 
7. 	Phasing of Buffer Zones. If the project is constructed in phases, the required buffer zone 
may also be constructed in phases. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the extent 
of each phase taking into consideration the adjacent land uses; the distance between land uses; building heights; and the physical characteristics of the site such as topography, ex­isting vegetation, etc. 
8. 	Buffer Zone Waivers.  Should the Zoning Administrator determine, upon inspection, that an adequate landscaping screen on a site already exists, or that such landscaping screen shall not be required, the buffer zone requirements may be waived in whole or in part.

CHAPTER 13 

ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS 
SECTION 13.01 PURPOSE 
Environmental standards are established in order to preserve the short-term and long-term environmental 
health, safety and quality of the Township. No use otherwise allowed shall be permitted in any district that 
does not conform to the environmental standards set forth in this Chapter 
SECTION 13.02 PRESERVATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 
The preservation and enhancement of natural features is essential to maintaining Delta Townships charac­ter, ecological diversity and stability, economic well-being, and quality of life. For purposes of this section, natural features shall include wetlands, watercourses, floodplains, and woodlands and trees. When natural features exist on a site proposed to be developed, the applicant shall do the following: 
A. 	Federal, State, and Local Permits. Development in or affecting natural features may be regulated by the federal, state, county or Township governments, and require licenses, permits, or approv­als.  Permits and approvals required by Delta Charter Township shall not relieve a person from 
obtaining applicable permits or approvals from other relevant jurisdictions. Similarly, obtaining 
permits from the federal, state or county government does not relieve a person from obtaining the required permits from Delta CharterTownship. 
B. 	Protected Natural Features.  In any zoning district, none of the following natural features shall be 
obstructed, removed, altered, transformed, or otherwise impacted in any way at any time by any person except as may be permitted by the applicable regulating agency: 
1. 	
Area, water level, vegetation, edge, bank, shore or natural condition of a river, stream, watercourse, drainage way, lake, or pond, whether filled or partly filled with water or dry in certain seasons. 

2. 	
Area, water level, vegetation or natural conditions of a marsh, swamp or regulated wetland. 

3. 	
Living tree(s). 


Site plans to be reviewed by the Township Planning Commission shall be accompanied by the in­formation described in 13.02 C. and D. below. Any such alterations shall be made in conformance to applicable local, state, and federal requirements. 
C. 	Natural Features Impact Statement.  As part of the Site Plan Review process, as set forth in this or­dinance, the applicant is required to determine if natural features exist on the site.  If one natural feature is determined to exist on a site, then the applicant shall submit a Natural Features Impact 
Statement containing the following information:    





1. 	Site inventory map clearly showing locations and types of natural features both on-site and those within one hundred (100) feet beyond the property lines. The drawing shall delineate: 
a. 	Edges of woodlands, and description of plant community type, but not to include an inventory of individual tree species, sizes, and locations.  
b. 	Edges of wetlands, watercourse stream banks, ordinary pond and high water marks of water features, floodways, floodplains, areas of hydric soils, and highly perme­able soils. 
2. 	
A written description that illustrates the quality, character, and health of the natural fea­tures. 

3. 	
The following standards are intended to protect large mature trees on the periphery of office, commercial, and industrial zoned properties, as well as preserve the natural appear­ance of properties from a roadway. 


a. 	A plan shall be provided identifying the species, size, and location of living trees with a Diameter at Breast Height (4.5 ft. above grade) of eight (8) inches or greater in required front and rear setback areas abutting a roadway. These trees shall be preserved. 
b. 	Tree trimming and tree removal necessary to provide vehicular drives, sidewalks/ paths, clear vision areas, utilities, drainage systems, etc. shall be permitted. The removal of diseased, storm damaged, and invasive trees such as box elders, poplars, 
and cottonwoods shall be permitted. 
4. 	Developers of residential subdivisions should refer to the Delta Charter Township Subdivi­sion Regulations to determine any applicable tree protection regulations. 
D. 	Natural Features Protection Plan. In addition to the Natural Features Impact Statement, the ap­plicant shall provide a Natural Features Protection Plan as part of the Site Plan Review process, showing: 
1. 	
Natural features on the subject parcel that are excluded from development. 

2. 	
Natural features that are to be retained as part of the development, and the measures taken to sustain the natural features.  


SECTION 13.03 FLOOD HAZARD REGULATIONS 
A. 	Purpose: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified flood hazard areas in Delta Charter Township. It is the purpose of this section to reduce hazards to persons and damage to property in such areas and to comply with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, and subsequent regulations enacted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such regulations, while permitting reasonable economic use of said lands, will help protect the public safety and health, and prevent or minimize public and private economic losses caused by periodic flooding, and preserve the ability of flood plains to carry and discharge a base flood. 





B. 
C. 
D. 
Applicability:  All land and land uses within the designated flood hazard area shall be subject to the terms specified herein and the provisions and requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program, as constituted in accord with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, and subsequent enactments and rules and regulations promulgated in furtherance of this program 
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as published in the Federal Register, Vd. 41,207, October 26, 1976, as amended. 
Flood Plain Delineation: 
1. 	The boundaries of the flood hazard area within Delta Charter Township shall be as de­termined by the report entitled The Flood Insurance Study, Delta Charter Township, as amended, Federal Emergency Management Agency, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary Maps and Floodway Maps.  Within the flood hazard area, a regulatory floodway shall coincide with the floodway boundaries indicated on the Flood 
Boundary and Floodway Map.  
2. 	
Where disputes arise as to the exact boundary of the 100-year flood plain, the Township Engineer shall resolve the dispute, and establish the boundary location. In all cases, the decision of the Township Engineer shall modify the boundary of the 100-year flood plain studies issued by the Federal Insurance Administration. 

3. 	
Where a dispute involves an allegation that the boundary is incorrect as mapped and Federal Insurance Administration flood plain studies are being questioned, the Township Engineer shall modify the boundary of the 100-year flood plain only upon receipt of an official letter of map amendment issued by the Federal Insurance Administration. 


Site Development Requirements for Flood Plain Areas:  All lands, buildings, structures, and uses within the flood hazard area shall be subject to the following site development requirements: 
1. 	
No building or structure shall be constructed, placed, or substantially improved so as to extend its use within the flood hazard area. 

2. 	
Filling within the flood hazard area with any material in any manner is prohibited unless: 


a. 	A measure such as compensating excavation and shaping of the flood plain, the flow, and impoundment capacity of the flood plain will be maintained or im­proved; and 
b. 	Such action is approved by the Department of Natural Resources. In areas where the Department of Natural Resources has no authority to grant such approval, 
applicants shall submit a registered engineers determination that Section 13.03 
D.2.a. will be met. 
3. 	Uses which, by their construction, operation, or use of physical structures impede the abil­ity of the flood plain to carry and discharge a base flood shall be prohibited.  Applicants shall submit to the Zoning Administrator a registered engineers determination that flood carrying capacity shall be maintained or a permit for approval from the Department of Natural Resources. 





4. 	In any zoning district, the 100-year flood plain area shall not be included in determination of net buildable lot area for the purposes for computing densities, except within Planned Unit Developments, as per the provisions herein. 
E. 	100-Year Flood Plain Application Information: 
1. 	In addition to the information required with an application for a certificate of zoning compli­ance, variance, or any other type of development permission required under this Ordinance, 
the following information shall be submitted as a part of an application for permission to commence any type of development within the 100-year flood plain: 
a. 	
A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and where such watercourse is not subject to state and federal regulations designed to insure flood carrying capacity, the ap­plicant shall provide a registered engineers determination that the flood carrying capacity will be maintained. 

b. 	
Proof of development permission from appropriate local, state, and federal agen­cies, including a flood plain permit, approval, or letter certifying a lack of authority from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources under authority of Act 245, Public Acts of 1929, as amended by Act 167, Public Acts of 1968, the Flood Plain Regulatory Authority. 


c. 	Base flood elevation data where the proposed development is subject to the Land Division Act, as amended, or greater than five (5) acres in size.  
d. 	Additional information which the Zoning Administrator or Township Engineer deems reasonably necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
2. 	Upon request of the Zoning Administrator, applicants for certificates of zoning compliance and variances shall furnish to the Zoning Administrator a certified land survey indicating the elevation and location of the flood hazard area, and appropriate additional site information 
as deemed necessary. 
F. 	Variance from Flood Plain Regulations: 
1. 	
Variances from the provisions of Section 13.03, Flood Hazard Regulations, shall only be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals upon a determination of compliance with the stan­dards for variances contained in this Ordinance. 

2. 	
A variance shall not be granted within the 100-year flood plain where the result would be an increase in flood levels during a base flood discharge. 

3. 	
The variance granted shall be the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to af­ford relief to the applicant. 

4. 	
In granting a variance within the 100-year flood plain the Board of Appeals shall require the 







following flood hazard reduction standards be complied with. 
a.  All new construction of, or substantial improvements to, any structure or building shall be:  
i.  Designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.  
ii.  Constructed with materials and utility equipment (electrical, heating, ventila­tion, plumbing, air conditioning, etc.) resistant to, or located to avoid, flood damage.  
iii.  Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.  
iv.  Have the lowest floor of buildings (including basement) elevated at or above the 100-year flood plain elevation.  
v.  Have any enclosed areas below a lowest floor or basement ventilated with at least two (2) openings (within one (1)-foot above grade) having a total net area of at least one (1) square foot per one hundred forty-four (144) square feet of enclosed floor area.  
b.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall minimize or eliminate infiltra­tion of flood waters into the system.  
c.  All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall minimize or eliminate in­filtration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.  
d.  All public utilities and facilities shall be designed, constructed, and located to mini­mize or eliminate flood damage.  
e.  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.  
f.  The applicant shall provide appropriate site and building plans and engineering data to demonstrate compliance with the above standards.  This data shall be prepared by a qualified professional and submitted to the Zoning Administrator for review by the appropriate Township officials.  
g.  A permit of approval shall be obtained from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, as amended, prior to the granting of such variance.  

G. 	Disclaimer of Liability: 
1. 	The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based upon engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger 





floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natu­ral causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.  
2. 	Approval of the use of land under this Section shall not be considered a guarantee or war­ranty of safety from flood damage.  This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside the 100-year flood plain will be free from flood damage. This Ordinance does not create liabil­ity on the part of Delta Charter Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully

CHAPTER 14 
NON-CONFORMITIES 
SECTION 14.01 PURPOSE 
A. 	It is the purpose of this Chapter to provide regulations governing lots, buildings, structures and the uses thereof, which were legal before this Ordinance was adopted, or amended, including legal nonconforming lots, uses, buildings, and structures, that would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the provisions of this Ordinance.  It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these buildings and structures, herein referred to as nonconformities, to remain until the nonconformity is abandoned, discontinued, significantly damaged, destroyed, or removed. 
B. 	These nonconformities are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with the uses and build­ings and structures lawfully permitted by this Ordinance. The regulations contained in this Chap­ter are designed to ensure that such nonconformities will be properly regulated so as to result in a minimum of disharmony in the districts in which they are located. 
C. 	It is the intent of these regulations to gradually eliminate nonconforming uses and structures over time. 
D. 	The tenancy, ownership, or management of any nonconforming use or nonconforming structure 
may change without altering the legal status of the nonconforming use or nonconforming struc­ture. 
SECTION 14.02 NON-CONFORMING USES 
A. 	Non-Conforming Uses on Parcels and Lots. 
1. 	Where, on the date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful use of a parcel or lot, such use not involving any buildings or structures or upon which parcel, or lot a building or structure is accessory to such principal use, exists that is no longer permissible under the provisions of this Ordinance, such principal use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: 
a. 	
No such non-conforming use of a parcel or lot shall be enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the date of adop­tion or amendment of this Ordinance and no accessory use, building, or structure shall be established therewith. 

b. 	
No such non-conforming use of a parcel or lot shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of such parcel or lot not occupied on the date of adoption of this Ordinance. 


2. 	If such non-conforming use of a parcel or lot has been discontinued for the continuous period of one (1) year or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, such 





discontinuation shall be considered conclusive evidence of an intention to legally abandon 
the non-conforming use of a parcel or lot.  At the end of this period of abandonment, the non-conforming use of a parcel or lot shall not be re-established, and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
3. 	Prior to termination of a non-conforming use of a parcel or lot due to abandonment or dis­continuation, the Township Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice of the Town­ships intent to terminate such non-conforming use to the property owner identified in the Townships most recent property tax rolls, by personal delivery, or by first class mail. Said notice shall provide the date, time, and place when the Township Board will hold a public hearing on the question of such abandonment or discontinuance with a final determination 
being made by the Township Board.  Factors that the Township Board shall consider when determining whether there was intent to abandon the non-conforming use include, but 
shall not be limited to: 
a. 	
The length of time the use has ceased. 

b. 	
The disconnection of utility services. 


c. 	
The removal of buildings and structures. 

d. 	
The lack of normal maintenance of buildings and grounds. 


B. 	Non-Conforming Uses of Buildings and Structures. 
1. 	
Where, on the date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful use of a build­ing or structure exists that is no longer permissible under the regulations of this Ordinance, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 

2. 	
If such non-conforming use of a building or structure has been discontinued for the continu­ous period of one (1) year or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, such 


discontinuation shall be considered conclusive evidence of an intention to legally abandon 
the nonconforming use.  At the end of this period of abandonment, the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished, and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
3. 	Prior to termination of a non-conforming use of a structure or building due to abandon­ment or discontinuation, the Township Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice of the Townships intent to terminate such non-conforming use of a structure or building to 
the property owner identified in the Townships most recent property tax rolls, by personal delivery, or by first class mail. Said notice shall provide the date, time, and place when the Township Board will hold a public hearing on the question of such abandonment or discon­tinuance with a final determination being made by the Township Board. Factors that the 
Township Board shall consider when determining whether there was intent to abandon the 
non-conforming use include, but shall not be limited to: 
a. 	The length of time the use has ceased. 





b. The disconnection of utility services. 
c. 	
The removal of buildings and structures. 

d. 	
The lack of normal maintenance of buildings and grounds. 


4. 	
Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the dis­trict, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 

5. 	
Where a non-conforming status applies to a structure and premises in combination, re­moval, or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of greater than the structures state equalized value (SEV), as determined by the Township Assessor at the time of the destruction. 


SECTION 14.03 NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES 
A. 	Continuance.  Use of a non-conforming building or structure may continue after the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. Any nonconforming building or structure that is damaged by fire, flood, wind, or other Acts of God in excess of the structures precatastrophe state equalized value (SEV), as determined by the Township Assessor, shall not be rebuilt, repaired, or reconstructed, except in complete conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.  In the event that the damage is less than the structures precatastrophe SEV, as determined by the Township Assessor, the structure may be restored to its precatastrophe status. Such restoration shall take place only upon approval of the Building Official and all construction shall be in full compliance with applicable provisions of this Ordinance and applicable Township codes which is commenced within two (2) years of the date of damage, and is diligently pursued to completion.  
B. 	Moved.  A nonconforming building or structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to another Township location unless such building or structure complies with all of the applicable site devel­opment standards and other provisions of this Ordinance.  
C. 	Repairs and Maintenance.  Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the repair or maintenance of a nonconforming building or structure to correct deterioration, obsolescence, depreciation, and wear.  
D. 	Unsafe or Unlawful. If a non-conforming building or structure, or a portion of a building or struc­ture containing a non-conforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by the building official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
SECTION 14.04 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD 
A. 	Where the owner of a single, non-conforming lot of record in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance does not own sufficient land to enable them to conform to the requirements of this Ordinance relating to minimum lot area or width, or both, such lot of record may be used as 





a building site, provided that the other provisions and requirements of this Ordinance are complied with, except as provided in Section 14.04 B. below. 
B. 	The minimum side yard setback requirements for lots of record in the AG1, AG2, RA, RB, RC, and RM zoning districts which are non-conforming due to inadequate lot width shall be ten percent (10%) of the lot width, but in no case shall the side setback be less than five (5) feet. In all other zoning districts, minimum side yard setback requirements specified herein shall be complied with.

J. 	Stay. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals that a stay would, in their opinion, cause immi­nent peril to life or property, in which case, the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restrain­
ing order which may be granted by the Circuit Court on application, and on due cause shown.

SECTION 15.03 REVERSE OR AFFIRM ZONING ADMINISTRATOR 
A. 	Appeals. An appeal of an order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be taken from a person aggrieved or from an officer, department, board, or bureau of the state, county, or Township. 





B. 	Power and Duty. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where there is an error alleged in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Adminis­trator in the enforcement of this Ordinance. 
C. 	Reverse or Affirm Zoning Administrator.

SECTION 15.04 VARIANCE 
A. 	Power and Duty. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power and duty to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such non-use variances from the provisions of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulty. 
B. 	Application Required. An application for a variance shall be with the Zoning Administrator or their designee. The application shall consist of a completed application form, required fee, and docu­mentation demonstrating all of the following: 
1. 	That the variance request is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not 
to the general neighborhood conditions. 
2. 	
That the variance would not cause a substantial adverse effect on properties in the imme­diate vicinity of the subject parcel or be contrary to the public interest. 

3. 	
That the need for the variance is not self-created. 

4. 	
That the variance is not contrary to the purposes of this Ordinance. 

5. 	
That no non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 


C. 	Findings. Prior to granting a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that one (1) of the following requirements have been met by the applicant for the variance: 
1. 	
Where there are practical difficulties preventing an applicant from strict compliance with the restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, or density which would unreasonably prevent the applicant from using the property for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity with such regulations unnecessarily burdensome. 

2. 	
That the granting of a variance would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district, or whether a lesser relaxation than that applied for would give substantial relief to the applicant, and be more consistent with justice to other 


property owners. 





3. 	That the plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances of the property and not to 
general conditions in the area. 
4. 	That the variance observes the spirit of the Ordinance, secures public safety, and does sub­
stantial justice. 
D. 	Conditions and Safeguards. In granting any variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance provided said conditions: 
1. 	
Are designed to protect natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 

2. 	
Are necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, are related to the 


standards established in the Ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration, and 
are necessary to ensure compliance with those standards. 
E. 	Violations. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance, and punishable under Section 3.07 of this Ordinance. 
F. 	Limitations of Authority. Under no circumstances shall the Zoning Board of Appeals grant a variance 
as follows: 
1. 	
To allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Ordinance in the District involved. 

2. 	
Alter or change the zoning classification of a property. 

3. 	
Make any changes to the regulations herein or take any action which results, in effect, in making a legislative change. 


SECTION 15.05 VOIDING AND REAPPLICATION FOR VARIANCE 
A. 	Time Limit for Variances Granted: 
1. 	
Each variance granted under the provisions of this Ordinance shall become null and void unless the construction, occupancy, or other actions authorized by such variance have com­menced within two (2) years of the granting of such variance. 

2. 	
Upon written application filed with the Zoning Administrator or their designee prior to the termination of the two (2) year time period, the Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize a single extension of the time limit for an additional period of not more than one (1) year upon the finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that the project has a reasonable expecta­tion of being continued to construction. 


B. 	Reapplication for Variances Denied: No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part by the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be resubmitted within one (1) year from the date of the original filing of an application for the variance, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions relating to the reasons for the denial of the original appeal found by the Zoning 
Board of Appeals to be valid. 





SECTION 15.06 APPEALS OF ZONING BOARD OF APPEAL DECISIONS

In the case of an amendment to the Official Zoning Map, the Planning Commission shall consider the criteria contained in Section 16.04 in making its finding and recommendation. 
C. 	Following receipt of the findings and recommendation of the Planning Commission, the Township Board shall consider the proposed amendment.  In the case of an amendment to the text of this Ordinance, the Township Board may modify or revise the proposed amendment as recommended

The Plan­ning Commission shall report its findings in full, along with its recommendations for disposition of the application to the Township Board. 
B. 	Findings.  The facts to be considered by the Planning Commission and Township Board shall include, 
but not be limited to, the following: 
1. 	
Whether the rezoning is consistent with the goals, policies, and uses proposed for the sub­ject parcel in the Townships Comprehensive Plan. 

2. 	
Whether the rezoning is justified by a change in conditions since the original ordinance was adopted or by an error in the original ordinance. 

3. 	
Whether the subject parcel possesses natural features and environmental characteristics which would be significantly adversely impacted by a development or use allowed by the requested rezoning. 

4. 	
Whether the rezoning complies with the purposes of this ordinance as described in Section 

1.02 D. 

5. 	
Whether uses allowed under the proposed rezoning would be equally or better suited to the area than uses allowed under the current zoning. 

6. 	
The ability of the Township or other governmental agencies to provide services, infrastruc­


ture and facilities that may be required if the rezoning were approved. 
SECTION 16.05 AMENDMENTS REQUIRED TO CONFORM TO COURT DECREE 
Any amendment for the purpose of conforming to a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be 
adopted by the Township Board and published, without necessity of a public hearing or referral thereof to any other board or agency. 





SECTION 16.06 CONDITIONAL REZONING PROCEDURES 
A. 	Intent.  It is recognized that there are certain instances where it would be in the best interests of the Township, as well as advantageous to a property owner seeking a change in a zoning clas­sification, if certain conditions could be proposed by a property owner as part of a request for a rezoning. It is the intent of this Section to provide a process consistent with the provisions of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, as amended, by which an owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request. 
B. 	Application and Offer of Conditions.  
1. 	A property owner may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is requested. This offer may be made either at the time the application for rezoning is filed or may be made at a later time during the 
rezoning process. 
2. 	
The required application and process for considering a Conditional Rezoning request shall be the same as that for considering rezoning requests made without any offer of condi­tions, except as modified by the requirements of this Section. 

3. 	
The Notice of Public Hearing for a Conditional Rezoning request shall include a general description of the conditions proposed by the property owner.  

4. 	
The owners offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses and/or developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district. 

5. 	
The owners offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the property for which the Conditional Rezoning is requested. 

6. 	
Any use and/or development proposed in conjunction with a Conditional Rezoning that would require special use approval under the terms of this Ordinance may only be com­


menced if special use approval for such use and/or development is ultimately granted in 
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
7. 	
Any use and/or development proposed in conjunction with a Conditional Rezoning that would require a variance under the terms of this Ordinance may only be commenced if a variance for such use and/or development is ultimately granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 

8. 	
Any use and/or development proposed in conjunction with a Conditional Rezoning that would require site plan approval under the terms of this Ordinance may only be com­menced if site plan approval for such use and/or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance. 

9. 	
The offer of conditions may be amended during the processing of a rezoning request pro­vided that any amended or additional conditions are entered voluntarily by the property owner. An owner may withdraw all or part of their offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action by the Township Board provided that, if such withdrawal occurs after 







the Planning Commissions public hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezon­
ing application shall be referred to the Planning Commission for a new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation. 
C. 	Approval.  
1. 	
The Planning Commission and Township Board shall consider, but not limit themselves to, the facts contained in Section 16.04 B. when reviewing a request for a Conditional Rezoning and Conditional Rezoning Agreement. 

2. 	
If the Township Board approves the rezoning request and offer of conditions, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a Conditional Rezoning Agreement acceptable to the owner and conforming in form to the provisions of this Section. The Conditional Rezoning Agreement shall be incorporated by attachment to the rezoning request at such time as the 


rezoning is approved by the Township Board. 
D. 	Conditional Rezoning Agreement. 
1. 	A Conditional Rezoning Agreement shall be submitted with a rezoning application and shall include the following: 
a. 	
Be in a form recordable with the County Register of Deeds. 

b. 	
A statement acknowledging that the Agreement runs with the property and is bind­ing upon successor owners of the property. 


c. 	
A statement confirming that the Agreement was proposed by the owner and en­tered into voluntarily. 

d. 	
A statement confirming that the property shall not be used or developed in a man­ner that is inconsistent with the conditions placed on the rezoning. 

e. 	
A list of conditions proposed by the owner. 

f. 	
A legal description of the property. 

g. 	
A sketch plan or other documents in sufficient detail to illustrate any specific condi­tions proposed by the owner. 


E. 	Compliance with Conditions. 
1. 	Any person who establishes a development or commences a use and/or development on 
a property that has been the subject of a Conditional Rezoning shall continuously operate and maintain the use and/or development in compliance with all of the conditions set forth in the Conditional Rezoning Agreement. Any failure to comply with a condition stipulated in the Conditional Rezoning Agreement shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed a nuisance 
per se and subject to judicial abatement as provided by law. 





2. 	No permit or approval shall be granted under this Ordinance for any use and/or develop­ment that is contrary to the Conditional Rezoning Agreement. 
F. 	Amendment to Zoning Map. 
Upon approval by the Township Board of a Conditional Rezoning request and a Conditional Rezoning Agreement, the Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect a new zoning classification along with a relevant designation providing notice of the Conditional Rezoning Agreement. 
G. 	Time Period for Establishing the Use and/or Development. 
A use and/or development authorized by a Conditional Rezoning and Conditional Rezoning Agreement shall be commenced upon the property within two (2) years from the effective date of the rezoning. A use and/or development of the property is defined as actual physical construction of a substantial nature of 
the approved building improvements which must have commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion in accordance with the necessary Township approvals and permits. The two (2) year time limi­tation may, upon written request by the property owner prior to expiration, be extended by the Township Board if it is demonstrated to the Boards reasonable satisfaction that there is a strong likelihood that the use and/or development will commence within the period of the extension and proceed diligently thereaf­
ter to completion and further that the Board finds that there has not been a change in circumstances that would render the Conditional Rezoning and Conditional Rezoning Agreement incompatible with other zon­ing districts and uses in the surrounding area or be inconsistent with sound planning and zoning policies. 
H. 	Reversion of Zoning. 
If the use and/or development approved as a Conditional Rezoning does not occur within the time frame specified in Section 16.06 G. above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, as amended. The reversion process shall be initiated by the Township Board requesting that the Planning Commission proceed with consideration of rezoning of the property to its former zoning classification. The procedure for considering and making this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter be the same as applies to all other rezoning requests.  
I. 	Subsequent Rezoning of Property. 
When property that is rezoned as a Conditional Rezoning with a Conditional Rezoning Agreement is there­after rezoned to a different zoning classification or to the same zoning classification but with a different or no Conditional Rezoning Agreement, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to Section 16.06 
H. above or otherwise, the Conditional Rezoning Agreement imposed under the former zoning classifica­tion shall cease to be in effect.  
J. 	Amendment of Conditions. 
1. 	During the two (2) year period for commencement of an approved use and/or develop­ment pursuant to Section 16.06 G. above, or during any extension thereof granted by the Township Board, the Township shall not add to or alter the conditions in the Conditional Rezoning Agreement. 





2. 	The Conditional Rezoning Agreement may be amended thereafter in the same manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and Conditional Rezoning Agreement. 
K. 	Recordation. 
A Conditional Rezoning approval shall not become effective until the Conditional Rezoning Agree­ment is recorded with the Eaton County Register of Deeds and a certified copy of the Agreement is filed with the Township Clerk. 
L. 	Township Right to Rezone. 
Nothing in the Conditional Rezoning Agreement nor in the provisions of this Section shall be deemed to prohibit the Township Board from rezoning all or any portion of a property that is subject to a Conditional Rezoning Agreement to another zoning classification. 
M. 	Failure to Offer Conditions. 
The Township Board shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect an owners rights under this Ordinance.
