possession, but is an indication to whom requests for copies of records and information regarding the

not be considered to be requests that are made pursuant to the Missouri Sunshine Law, Chapter 610
of the revised Missouri Statutes. However, any official or employee of the City of Palmyra who receives
a request is directed to inform the City Clerk of the request in a timely fashion, so that a response may

The Custodian of Records shall respond to the request within three (3) business days of its receipt. A
"Business Day" is a day when the City Hall is open for the conduct of City business during its normal

search through every record of the City in order for the City to certify that it has "all" or "every"
document. Such searches are expensive. Similarly, a request for records compiled in a format differing
from the format in which the records are customarily retained is a request for a search and compilation,
and can be expensive. As a general rule, the Custodian of Records is not expected to engage in
expensive searches or compilations. Any search request that will require more than fifteen (15)
minutes of the custodian's time will be refused without a substantial advance deposit for the estimated

maintained as closed records. No such closed records shall be released to any person who is not part
of the City government, except that the City's auditor may see such records as are reasonably
necessary to prepare an audit report as requested by the City of Palmyra, and the City Attorney may
see such records as are reasonably necessary to represent the City of Palmyra. Requests that closed
records be opened to public inspection will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the City Council.
Section 135.110. Subpoena For Closed Records.
[Ord. No. 1186-16-12, 12-15-2016]
No subpoena for a closed record shall be honored. All subpoenas for a closed record shall be referred

to indicate that it is "confidential" or a "closed record," or who has been invited to participate in a closed
meeting who none the less discloses any closed record, or any information about the contents of any
closed meeting to any person shall be guilty of an offense under the ordinances of the City, and upon
conviction therefor may be punished as provided by law. Any such person who is employed or working
for the City may also be subject to the termination of their employment as a result of such disclosure.

It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or

If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.

an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.

after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense. (RSMo.
§562.014, 2014 effective 1-1-2017)
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

As used in this Article, the following terms mean:
ENTER UNLAWFULLY or REMAIN UNLAWFULLY
A person enters or remains in or upon premises when he or she is not licensed or privileged to do
so. A person who, regardless of his or her purpose, enters or remains in or upon premises which
are at the time open to the public does so with license and privilege unless he or she defies a
lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to him or her by the owner of such
premises or by other authorized person. A license or privilege to enter or remain in a building
which is only partly open to the public is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part of
the building which is not open to the public.

In any prosecution under Subsection (A)(4), proof that a meter or any other property of a utility has
been tampered with, and the person or persons accused received the use or direct benefit of the
electric, gas, steam or water service with one (1) or more of the effects described in Subsection
(A)(4), shall be sufficient to support an inference which the trial court may submit to the trier of fact
from which the trier of fact may conclude that there has been a violation of such Subsection by the
person or persons who use or receive the direct benefit of the electric, gas, steam or water
service. (RSMo. §569.090, 2005, 2014 effective 1-1-2017)

A person commits the offense of financial exploitation of an elderly person or a person with a
disability if such person knowingly obtains control over the property of the elderly person or person
with a disability with the intent to permanently deprive the person of the use, benefit or possession
of his or her property thereby benefitting the offender or detrimentally affecting the elderly person

Promising performance which the offender does not intend to perform or knows will not be
performed. Failure to perform standing alone is not sufficient evidence to prove that the

disability has become accustomed at the time of such actions.
It shall not be a defense to financial exploitation of an elderly person or person with a disability that
the accused reasonably believed that the victim was not an elderly person or person with a
disability.

personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts. For the purpose of
determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing contracts which provide options to
buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to the lessee.
Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay
the lease charges to the lessor within seven (7) days after written demand for the return has been
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address the person set forth in the lease
agreement, or in the absence of the address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall
be evidence of intent to violate the provisions of this Section, except that if a motor vehicle has not
been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement,
such failure to return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of
stealing leased or rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the
motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease
or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the
lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor
vehicle to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor
vehicles. Any Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor
vehicle and notify the lessor that he/she may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed
and its vehicle identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or
rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the seven-day
period prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the
property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five
(5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this
Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.
This Section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more
difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the
lessee shall notify the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the expiration
of the lease or rental agreement or within ten (10) days after proper notice.
Any person who has leased or rented personal property of another who destroys such property so
as to avoid returning it to the owner commits the offense of property damage pursuant to Section
569.100, RSMo., or Section 210.1040 of this Code in addition to being in violation of this Section.
Venue shall lie in the County where the personal property was originally rented or leased. (RSMo.

transmission of account information within ten (10) days after receiving actual notice in writing
that it has not been paid because of insufficient funds or credit with the drawee or because
there is no such drawee.
As used in Subsection (A)(2) of this Section, "actual notice in writing" means notice of the nonpayment
which is actually received by the defendant. Such notice may include the service of
summons or warrant upon the defendant for the initiation of the prosecution of the check or checks
which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons or warrant contains information of
the ten-day period during which the instrument may be paid and that payment of the instrument
within such ten-day period will result in dismissal of the charges. The requirement of notice shall
also be satisfied for written communications which are tendered to the defendant and which the
defendant refuses to accept. (RSMo. §570.120, 2005, 2014 effective 1-1-2017)

[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health,
safety and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Palmyra, Missouri, ordains as
follows.
Section 425.020. Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of City of
Palmyra, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section 425.030. Statement of Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Article I, Section 425.020(A); to establish or maintain the City
of Palmyra's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined
in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR
60.3(b) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
Article II. General Provisions
Section 425.040. Lands To Which Chapter Applies.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008; Ord. No. 1128-10-02 §1, 6-17-2010]
This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Palmyra identified as
unnumbered A Zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Marion County, Missouri, dated
effective July 22, 2010 on panel number 29127CO175D, as amended, and any future revisions
thereto. In all areas covered by this Section, no development shall be permitted except through the
issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the City Council or its duly designated
representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated
3/8/2020 City of Palmyra, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/PA3392?guid=28618599,28358013,28355209,28355264,28355282,28355326,28355327,28355344,28355345,33328… 254/377
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare,
health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article V.
Section 425.050. Floodplain Administrator.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
The Mayor is hereby designated as the Floodplain Administrator under this Chapter.
Section 425.060. Compliance.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and
other applicable regulations.
Section 425.070. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
Section 425.080. Interpretation.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes.
Section 425.090. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside unnumbered
A Zones or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This
Chapter shall not create a liability on the part of City of Palmyra, any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
Section 425.100. Severability.
[Ord. No. 1113-08-11, 12-4-2008]
If any Section, clause, provision or portion of this Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby.

SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USER (SIU)
Except as provided in Subsections (c) and (d) of this definition, a significant industrial
user is:
An industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards; or
An industrial user that:
Discharges an average of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gpd or more of process
wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler
blowdown wastewater);
Contributes a process wastestream which makes up five percent (5%) or more
of the average dry-weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW treatment
plant; or
Is designated as such by the City on the basis that it has a reasonable potential
for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment
standard or requirement.
The City may determine that an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment
standards is a non-significant categorical industrial user rather than a significant
industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more than one
hundred dollars (100) gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater
(excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless
specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the following conditions are
met:

applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements;
The industrial user annually submits the certification statement required in
Subsection (F)(14)(b) [see 40 CFR 403.12(q)], together with any additional
information necessary to support the certification statement; and
The industrial user never discharges any untreated concentrated wastewater.
Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in Subsection (b) of this definition has
no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating
any pretreatment standard or requirement, the City may at any time, on its own
initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial user, and in
accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should
not be considered a significant industrial user.
SLUG LOAD OR SLUG DISCHARGE
Any discharge at a flow rate or concentration which could cause a violation of the
prohibited discharge standards in Subsection (B)(1) of this Section. A slug discharge is
any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental
spill or a non-customary batch discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause
interference or pass through, or in any other way violate the POTW's regulations, local
limits or permit conditions.

alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment
standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of
calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the
discretion of the Superintendent.
Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations
developed in this Subsection (B)(2) in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived.
Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one (1) limit for calculating maximum
daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average,
or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum
equivalent limitation.
Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the
Superintendent within two (2) business days after the user has a reasonable basis to
know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month.
Any user not notifying the Superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long-term average production rate.
State Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with State pretreatment standards codified
at 10 CSR 20-6.100.
Local Limits.
The following local limits have been developed pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c) to prevent
against interference and pass through.
The local limits expressed in pounds per day shall be distributed at the discretion of the
Superintendent via pretreatment program permits to each significant industrial user as
necessary. The sum total of each permitted local limit shall not exceed the mass in the
table below. At the discretion of the Superintendent, the limits established in pretreatment
permits may be imposed as pollutant concentrations using appropriate conversion
methods.
All values for metallic pollutants are for total metal unless otherwise indicated.
The Superintendent may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in
individual pretreatment program permits as local limits to implement the requirements of
Subsection (B)(1).
Local limits are subject to change as local environmental conditions change. All changes
to local limits shall be approved by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

The Superintendent may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in
individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements
of Subsection (B)(1).
City's Right Of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the
POTW consistent with the purpose of this Section.
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute
a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases
when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
Pretreatment Of Wastewater.
Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply
with this Section and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards,
local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Subsection (B)(1) of this Section within the time
limitations specified by the EPA, the State, or the Superintendent, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained
at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the Superintendent
before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Section.
Additional Pretreatment Measures.
Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require users to restrict their
discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged
only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may
be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the
requirements of this Section.
The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and
maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control
facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be
issued solely for flow equalization.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing

required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Superintendent, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by
the user at their expense.
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install
and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans. The Superintendent shall evaluate
whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action
to control slug discharges. The Superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to
control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Superintendent may develop such a plan for any
user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any accidental or slug
discharge, as required by Subsection (F)(6) of this Section; and
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment
for emergency response.
Hauled Wastewater.
Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the
Superintendent, and at such times as are established by the Superintendent. Such waste
shall not violate Subsection (B) of this Section or any other requirements established by
the City. The Superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits.
The Superintendent may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits. The Superintendent may require generators of hauled
industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The Superintendent
also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled
industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this Section.
Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the
Superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the Superintendent.
The Superintendent may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with
applicable standards. The Superintendent may require the industrial waste hauler to
provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form
shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit
number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected
waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination
under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users
currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the
Superintendent a report which contains the information listed in Subsection (F)(1)(b),
below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources,
and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of
an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the Superintendent a report which
contains the information listed in Subsection (F)(1)(b), below. A new source shall report
the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A
new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to
be discharged.
Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
All information required in Subsection (D)(5)(a)(1)(a), (2), (3)(a), and (6).
Measurement Of Pollutants.
The user shall provide the information required in Subsection (D)(5)(a)(7)(a)
through (d).
The user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile that
data necessary to comply with the requirements of this Subsection.
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if
such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in
40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards.

provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the
applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this Section
must meet the requirements set out in Subsection (F)(2) of this Section.
Signature And Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified
in accordance with Subsection (F)(14)(a) of this Section and signed by an authorized
representative as defined in Subsection (A)(4).
Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall apply to the
compliance schedule required by Subsection (F)(1)(b)(4) of this Section:
The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine
operation);
No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no later than fourteen (14)
days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, as a
minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any

standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Superintendent a report containing the information described
in Subsection (D)(5)(a)(6) and (7) and Subsection (F)(1)(b)(2) of this Section. For users
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in Subsection (B)(2), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure
of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Subsection (F)(14)(a) of this Section. All sampling will be done in conformance with
Subsection (F)(11).
Periodic Compliance Reports. All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports
even if they have been designated a non-significant categorical industrial user under the
provisions of Section 6.4C.
Except as specified in Section 6.4.C, all significant industrial users must, at a frequency
determined by the Superintendent, submit no less than twice per year (June and
December) reports indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by pretreatment standards, and the measured or estimated average
and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the
Superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user.
Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the last two (2) years
been in significant non-compliance, as defined in Subsection (I) of this Section. In
addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily flow rates,
production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the
Superintendent, decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result
in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Subsection (F)(14)(a) of this Section.
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow-measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section monitors any regulated
pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the
Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in Subsection (F)(11) of this Section,
the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
Reports Of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the Superintendent of any significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.
The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed
necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater
discharge permit application under Subsection (D)(5) of this Section.
The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under
Subsection (E)(6) of this Section or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit

under Subsection (E)(3) of this Section in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
Reports Of Potential Problems.
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges,
discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a slug
discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection
(F)(6)(a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who could cause such a
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
Significant industrial users are required to notify the Superintendent immediately of any
changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
Reports From Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater
discharge permit provide appropriate reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent
may require.
Notice Of Violation/Repeat Sampling And Reporting. If sampling performed by a user
indicates a violation, the user must notify the Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within thirty (30) days after
becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the City
performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling
at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the
user or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling
and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
Notification Of The Discharge Of Hazardous Waste.
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste
authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the
user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar
month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be
discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no
later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this Subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under
Subsection (F)(5) of this Section. The notification requirement in this Section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Subsection (F)(1), (3) and (4) of this
Section.

Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection (F)(9)(a), above, during a
calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous
wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d)
and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous
wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous
waste, the user must notify the Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user shall certify that it has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted
to be discharged by this Section, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or
State law.
Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where
the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the Superintendent or other parties approved by the EPA.
Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the
reporting period.
Except as indicated in Subsection (F)(11)(b) and (c) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized
by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile
organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance
reports required in Subsection (F)(1) and (3) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of

four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Superintendent
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Subsection (F)(4) (40 CFR
403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
Date Of Receipt Of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Section shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any
monitoring activities required by this Section, any additional records of information obtained
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established under
Subsection (B)(4)(d). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3)
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the Superintendent.

Search Warrants. If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this Section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this
Section or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant
from the Municipal Court of the City of Palmyra.
Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit
applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the
Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information
should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES
program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR
2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public
without restriction.
Publication Of users In Significant Non-compliance. The Superintendent shall publish annually, in
a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months,
were in significant non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The
term "significant non-compliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users [or any other
industrial user that violates Subsection I(3), (4) or (8) of this Section] and shall mean:
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six
percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in Subsection B;
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent
(33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a sixmonth
period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by Subsection (B) multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and one and two tenths (1.2) for
all other pollutants except pH);
Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by Subsection (B)
(daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the
Superintendent determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the
general public;
Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the
environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to
halt or prevent such a discharge;

Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
Notification Of Violation. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent
may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section
shall limit the authority of the Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
Consent Orders. The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for non-compliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to
correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents
shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
Subsection (J)(4) and (5) of this Section and shall be judicially enforceable.
Show-Cause Hearing. The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the
Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least
thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user as defined in Subsection (A)(4) and required by Subsection (D)(6)
(a). A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
Compliance Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional selfmonitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance

established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve
the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
Cease-And-Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Administrative Fines.
When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may
fine such user in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fines
shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm
average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60) calendar days, be assessed an
additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue
thereafter at a rate of one percent (1%) per month. A lien against the user's property shall
be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Superintendent to
reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of
being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Superintendent may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may
add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
Emergency Suspensions.
The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to
the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present,
an endangerment to the environment.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate
its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, the Superintendent may take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any

individuals. The Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Subsection (J)(8) of this Section are initiated against the user.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the
Superintendent prior to the date of any show-cause or termination hearing under
Subsection (J)(3) or (8) of this Section.
Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this Section.
Termination Of Discharge.
In addition to the provisions in Subsection (E)(5) of this Section, any user who violates the
following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge;
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume,
constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring, or sampling; or
Violation of the pretreatment standards in Subsection (B) of this Section.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under Subsection (J)(3) of this Section why the proposed
action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Superintendent shall not be a
bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
Injunctive Relief. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent
may petition the Circuit Court of Marion County, District 1, through the City's Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this Section on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also
seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
Civil Penalties.
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Section, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil
penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly

expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.
In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation,
the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the
user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and
any other factor as justice requires.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.
Criminal Prosecution.
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Section, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day.
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes
personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor

punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day.
In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day.
Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Section are not exclusive. The
Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's
enforcement response plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any
user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take
more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
Supplemental Enforcement Action.
Liability Insurance. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue an individual
wastewater discharge to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Section,
a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its
discharge.
Payment Of Outstanding Fees And Penalties. The Superintendent may decline to issue or
reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any
outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this Section, a

Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision
of this Section, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the user has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply.
Affirmative Defenses To Discharge Violations.
Upset.
For the purposes of this Section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
non-compliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for non-compliance
with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of Subsection (M)(1)(c),
below, are met.
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence
that:
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner
and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
The user has submitted the following information to the Superintendent within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days]:
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-compliance;
The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to continue; and
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence
of the non-compliance.
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset
shall have the burden of proof.
Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in
an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for non-compliance with the general prohibitions in Subsection (B)(1)
(a) of this Section or the specific prohibitions in Subsection (B)(1)(b)(1)(c) through (p) of this
Section if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or

in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference
and that either:
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with
each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or
constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance
with its NPDES permit and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable
sludge use or disposal requirements.
Bypass.
For the purposes of this Section:
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure
efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsection (M)(3)
(c) and (d) of this Section.
Bypass Notifications.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
Superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided
within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of
the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned
to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty-four (24) hours.
Bypass.
Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe
property damage;
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

safely located, shall be constructed by the owner at his expense in accordance with plans
approved by the Superintendent and shall be maintained by the owner at his expense.
All measurements,tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which
reference is made in this Chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required by the Superintendent, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
Sampling shall be carried out by the customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property.
Sampling of the effluent or waste discharges may be accomplished manually or by use of
mechanical equipment to obtain a composite sample which would be representative of the total
effluent. Samples shall be taken at intervals determined by the Superintendent as necessary to
maintain a control over the discharge from the establishment. The City shall have the right to enter
and set up on company property such devices or equipment necessary to conduct a gauging and
sampling operation and to begin such operation upon presentation of proper identification on

To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or pollution by containing within
the consumer's internal distribution system or private water system contaminants or pollutants
which could backflow through the service connection into the public potable water supply
system.
To promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water systems and non-potable
water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial-process systems.
To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination of pollution of all potable water
systems.
Application. This Chapter shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water system of
the City of Palmyra, not including the Marion County Public Water Supply District.
Policy. This Chapter will be reasonably interpreted by the Water Purveyor. It is the Water
Purveyor's intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the
degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
The Water Purveyor shall be primarily responsible for protection of the public potable water
distribution system from contamination or pollution due to backflow or contaminants or pollutants
through the water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement
and maintain the program to control cross-connections. The Water Purveyor and consumer are
jointly responsible for preventing contamination of the water system within the consumer's
premises.
If, in the judgment of the Water Purveyor or his authorized representative, cross-connection
protection is required through either piping modification or installation of an approved backflow
prevention device, due notice shall be give to the consumer. The consumer shall immediately
comply by providing the required protection at his own expense; and failure, refusal or inability on
the part of the consumer to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing
water service to the premises until such protection has been provided.
Section 705.020. Definitions.
[Ord. No. 832 §II]
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this Chapter:
AIR-GAP SEPARATION
The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from
any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the overflow
level rim of the receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured
vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel, but in no case less than one (1) inch.
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY
Any water source or system, other than the public water supply, that may be available in the
building or premises.
BACKFLOW
The flow other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign liquids, gases, or substances into
the distribution system of a public water supply.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE
Any device, method, or type of construction intended to prevent backflow into a potable water

[Ord. No. 832 §VI]
An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each service line to a consumer's
water system serving premises, where in the judgment of the Water Purveyor or the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources, actual or potential hazards to the public potable water system
exist. The type and degree of protection required shall be commensurate with the degree of
hazard.
An approved air-gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be
installed at the service connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the Water
Purveyor or the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the nature and extent of activities on
the premises, or the materials used in connection with the activities, or materials stored on the
premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross-connection
occur, even though such cross-connection may not exist at the time the backflow prevention
device is required to be installed. This includes but is not limited to the following situations:
Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the auxiliary supply is
acceptable to the Water Purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing
arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross-connections exist.
Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-connections cannot be made
with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure the cross-connections do not
exist.
Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being established or re-established.
Premises, which due to the nature of the enterprise, therein, are subject to recurring
modification or expansion.
Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the
public water supply, or where a cross-connection could reasonably be expected to occur. This
shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.
Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled such that if
backsiphonage or backpressure should occur, a serious health hazard may result.
The following types of facilities fall into one or more of the categories of premises where an
approved air-gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device is required
by the Water Purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to protect the public
water supply and must be installed at these facilities unless all hazardous or potentially hazardous
conditions have been eliminated or corrected by other methods to the satisfaction of the Water
Purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

There is hereby imposed, levied and assessed on the grantee of a franchise agreement between
the City of Palmyra and any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of supplying
natural gas service within the corporate limits of Palmyra pursuant to such franchise agreement,
an occupation and license tax (in lieu of all other occupation, license or other revenue taxes) for
the privilege of engaging in such business during the term of such agreement at the rate of five
percent (5%) on the gross receipts from the sale by said grantee of natural gas for domestic and
commercial purposes within the corporate limits of the City of Palmyra.
Said grantee shall not later than the first day of each calendar month in each year during the term
of any such agreement, make a report to the City Council of the City of Palmyra of its gross
receipts from the sale of gas for domestic and commercial purposes within the corporate limits of
Palmyra for the one (1) month period ending on the first day of the month next preceding that on
which the report is due; and at the time of making such reports, pay into the City Treasury a sum
equal to five percent (5%) of said gross receipts subsequent to the effective date of such
franchise, which may be charged to the operating expenses of said grantee. Domestic and
commercial sales shall be considered as sales made other than on special contracts providing for
stand-by fuel and interruption of service at any time demands of domestic and commercial
consumers may so require. So long as such grantee shall be required by any regulatory authority
having jurisdiction, to separately state the franchise tax increment on its charges for natural gas
service rendered under such franchise, the term "gross receipts" as used herein shall not include
the separately stated tax increment.
Any such grantee, by entering into any such franchise agreement and engaging in such business,
shall be deemed to have agreed to recognize the tax herein imposed as a valid tax and make said
payments during the term of such agreement, and the franchise so granted by the City shall be
conditioned upon such agreement.
In the event the tax imposed herein is determined by any court having proper jurisdiction to be
invalid, then the City may at its option terminate said franchise with such grantee upon written
notice to such grantee of said termination.
Every grantee of a franchise agreement between the City of Palmyra and any person, firm or
corporation engaged in the business of supplying natural gas service within the City of Palmyra,
shall maintain an office within the City limits for the acceptance of payments of sums due from
customers or users of the gas service for the charges made for such gas services. Such office
shall have the capability of accepting payments made in the form of cash, check or money order,
and making change in connection with payments made in cash. Such office shall have the further
capability of providing a receipt contemporaneous with payment upon the request of the customer
or user. Such office shall be open to the public not less than eight (8) hours between the hours
8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. during normal business days from Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays.
