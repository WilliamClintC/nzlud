PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Woodbury, Minnesota, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the City's 1985 Code, as supplemented through march 10, 1986, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1, and the first section of chapter 2 is 2-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-1 and 2-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 2-1.1, 2-1.2, and 2-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 14 and 15 it will be designated as Chapter 14.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the new successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indexes 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The republication of this Code was under direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President of Production and Peggy Lamar, Editor, of the Municipal Code corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Ms. Kimberlee Blaeser, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(1)  Personal leave. Upon the request of an employee, special leave of absence without pay may be granted by the city administrator, who shall take into consideration good conduct, length of service, the efficiency of the employee, and the general good of the city service. Leaves of absence without pay may only be requested after all vacation leave (and sick leave if for medical purposes) have been exhausted. Such leave of absence shall not exceed a period of 90 days, provided that the same may be extended beyond such period if the leave of absence is for continued disability or other good and sufficient reasons, but in no case shall the personal leave without pay exceed one year except when the employee is disabled for disability incurred while in performance of the employee's duties as an employee of the city. 
During the leave period, the employee will not accrue or be able to use accrued vacation, holidays, and sick leave. Employees on special leave without compensation shall have the option of continuing to participate in the city's health, dental, life and disability insurance by agreeing to pay the full premium of said coverage pursuant to procedures established by the finance director, but in no case shall this option exceed 18 months. 
(2)  Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). All employees who have worked for the city for a cumulative period of 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours for the city during the 12-month period prior to requesting a leave are eligible for up to 12 weeks of family or medical leave per 12-month period for either a birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child; to care for a spouse, parent or child who has a serious health condition; for a serious health condition of the eligible employee, or for "any qualifying exigency" arising out of the fact that an employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status in support of a contingency operation. Spouses employed by the city are entitled to a combined total of 12 work weeks of family leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for a parent (but not a parent-in-law) who has a serious health condition. Accrued vacation, personal, and sick leave (for the medical portion of the leave) may be used as a part of the 12-week FMLA leave. An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (closest blood relative) of a covered service member who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty while on active duty, is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the service member. This is a one-time 26 week leave provision that does not renew each FMLA year. A medical certification verifying the illness/injury will be required in order for this leave to be used. 
A minimum 30-day notice must be given prior to the date on which the leave is to begin. If 30 days cannot be given for unforeseen leave needs, the employee will give as much notice as practicable. Requests for leaves must be in writing and approved by the city administrator. 
a.  Accrued sick leave may be used as defined in City Code section 2-241(a) sick leave-authorized uses. 
b.  The city will continue to provide the employee with full benefits when an employee uses sick leave, vacation, or floating holiday(s) during the approved FMLA leave. 
c.  An employee on FMLA leave who is not using sick leave, vacation, or floating holiday(s) shall not be eligible to accrue any leave benefits during the leave. The city will continue to pay the normal portion of health, dental, life, and disability insurance as if the employee were working. An employee who is on unpaid leave must pay his or her portion of the premium of the said coverage if coverage continuation is desired during the leave, pursuant to procedures established by the finance director. 
(3)  Parental leave. All regular full-time and part-time employees who do not qualify for FMLA leave, who work an average of 20 hours or more per week and have successfully completed 12 months of employment may be granted a leave of absence from work by the city administrator provided that the employee is a natural or adoptive parent in conjunction with the birth or adoption of a child. The length of leave shall be determined by the employee, but may not exceed 12 weeks. 
Parental leave time shall begin at the time requested by the employee. The leave may not begin more than 12 months after the birth or adoption. The employee shall notify their supervisor in writing at least 45 days before the expected commencement date of parental leave. The leave shall be unpaid except as follows: 
a.  Accrued sick leave may be used as defined in City Code section 2-241(a) sick leave-authorized uses. 
b.  The city will continue to provide the employee with full benefits when an employee uses sick leave, vacation, or floating holiday(s) during the approved leave. 
c.  Leave without pay for parental purposes shall be considered medical leave only for that portion of the leave which the employee is medically unable to return to work, as certified by a licensed medical doctor. 
d.  An employee on parental leave who is not using sick leave, vacation, or floating holiday(s) shall not be eligible to receive any benefits during the leave but shall have the option of continuing to participate in the city's health, dental, life, and disability insurance by agreeing to pay the full premium of the said coverage pursuant to procedures established by the finance director, but in no case shall this option exceed 18 months. 
(4)  Military leave for families. The city will not discharge from employment or take adverse employment action against an employee because an immediate family member is in the military forces of the United States, or this state. Nor will the city discharge from employment or take adverse employment action against an employee because they attend the following kinds of events relating to the military service of an immediate family member. Employees should complete a "Request for Employee Leave" form as soon as practicable, marking the appropriate category, and submit it to their supervisor as soon as practicable. The unpaid leave may not exceed two consecutive calendar days or six days in a calendar year. Employees may substitute paid leave if they choose to do so. 
a.  Military ceremonies, family training, and reintegration for spouse, parent or child. This leave applies to immediate family members defined as a person's spouse, parent, or child. An employee shall be granted a leave without pay to: 
i.  Attend departure or return ceremonies for deploying or returning personnel; 
ii.  Family training or readiness events sponsored or conducted by the military; 
iii.  Event held as a part of official military reintegration programs. 
b.  Military ceremonies for extended family members. This leave applies to immediate family members defined as a person's grandparent, legal guardian, sibling, grandchild, fiancé or fiancée, spouse parent or child. An employee whose immediate family member has been ordered to active service in support of a war or other national emergency, shall be granted a leave without pay to attend a send-off or homecoming ceremony for the mobilized service member. Time off is for the actual time necessary for the employee to attend the ceremony, not to exceed one unpaid day in any calendar year. Employees may substitute paid leave if they so choose. The City may deny such leave if the leave would unduly disrupt the operations of the city. 
c.  Military member injured/killed in active service. This leave applies to immediate family members defined as a person's parent, child, grandparents, siblings, or spouse. An employee shall be granted a leave without pay for up to ten working days for an immediate family member, who as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, has been injured or killed while engaged in active service. An employee must give as much notice as practicable of their intent to exercise the leave guaranteed above. Employees may substitute paid leave if they choose to do so. This leave will run concurrently with any other applicable leave. For an unpaid absence of up to ten working days, an employee will accrue leave and the city will pay insurance contributions as if they were still at work. 
(b)  Conditions governing all leaves without pay. 
(1)  With the return from unpaid leaves, employees shall be entitled to all sick leave and vacation leave accrued prior to the leave which was not used during their absence. 
(2)  Failure of an employee to request an extension before the expiration of leave shall be considered a voluntary resignation. 
(3)  An employee granted unpaid leave of absence shall have the right to return to employment in the original job or position of like status and pay unless the employee's position has been discontinued or the employee would have been laid off if such employee had not been on leave. The city administrator shall have the right to place said employee in a position which most efficiently promotes the city welfare. 
(4)  If an employee had not yet completed his or her probationary period prior to beginning a leave of absence, his or her probationary period shall be extended by the amount of the leave of absence upon return. 
(5)  An employee returning from a leave is entitled to retain all unused accrued pre-leave benefits of employment and seniority as if there had been no interruption in service. 
(6)  An employee, by agreement with the city administrator, may return to work part-time during the leave period without forfeiting the right to return to employment at the end of the leave period.

If the screening company's response indicates that the manager has been convicted of a background check crime defined in subsection (5)(b)(1)-(3) of this section, the licensee may not hire the manager unless more than ten years have elapsed since the date of discharge of the sentence. If the manager was hired pending completion of the background check, the licensee shall terminate the manager's employment unless more than ten years have elapsed since the date of discharge of the sentence. Except as provided in paragraph c below, if a licensee otherwise knows that a manager has been convicted of a background check crime defined in subsection (5)(b)(1)-(3) of this section, the licensee shall terminate the manager's employment unless more than ten years have elapsed since the date of discharge of the sentence. 
c.  If a licensee knows that a manager hired before January 1, 2001, was convicted of a background check crime for an offense committed before January 1, 2001, the licensee may continue to employ the manager. However, the licensee shall notify all tenants and prospective tenants whose dwelling units would be accessible to the manager of the crime for which the manager has been convicted and of the right of a current tenant to terminate the tenancy under this paragraph, if the manager was convicted of a background check crime defined in: 
1.  Subsection (5)(a)(1)-(3) of this section; or 
2.  Subsection (5)(b)(1)-(3) of this section, unless more than ten years have elapsed since the sentence was discharged. 
Notwithstanding a lease provision to the contrary, a current tenant who receives a notice under this paragraph may terminate the tenancy within 60 days of receipt of the notice by giving the licensee 14 days' advance notice of the termination date. 
d.  The licensee shall notify the manager of any action taken under this subdivision. 
e.  If a licensee is required to terminate a manager's employment under paragraph (6)a. or b., or terminates a manager's employment in lieu of notifying tenants under paragraph (6)c., the licensee is not liable under any law, contract, or agreement, including liability for unemployment compensation, claims, for terminating the manager's employment in accordance with this section. Notwithstanding a lease or agreement governing termination of tenancy, if the manager whose employment is terminated is also a tenant, the licensee may terminate the tenancy immediately upon giving notice to the manager. An eviction action to enforce the termination of the tenancy must be treated as a priority writ under Minn. Stats. §§ 504B.321; 504B.335; 504B.345, subd. 1, 504B.361, subd. 2; and 504B.365, subd. 2.

    Common plan of development or sale is a contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at different times, or on different schedules, but under one proposed plan including but not limited to mass site grading, utility installation, street construction and home or building construction. This item is broadly defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or physical demarcation indicating that land disturbing activities may occur. 
    Compaction is the densification of a soil by removal of air, which requires mechanical energy. 
    Discharge is the release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage, of storm water, including snowmelt and dewatering water, from a site. 
    Earth material is any rock, natural soil or fill and/or any combination thereof. 
    Engineering geologist is a geologist experienced and knowledgeable in engineering geology. 
    Engineering geology is the application of geologic knowledge and principles in the investigation and evaluation of naturally occurring rock and soil for use in the design of civil works. 
    Erosion is the wearing away of the ground surface as a result of the movement of wind, water and/or ice. 
    Erosion control refers to methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or permanent cover, and construction phasing. 
    Excavation is the mechanical removal of earth material. 
    Fill is a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means. 
    Final stabilization means that all soil disturbing activities on the site or common plan of development or sale have been completed, and that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of at least 80 percent of the cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed, and that all temporary erosion control devises are removed, including silt fence, temporary sedimentation basins, and temporary standpipes. Simply sowing grass seed and/or mulch is not considered final stabilization. Final stabilization of a "common plan of development or sale" includes completion of building or home construction along with final restoration of all yards and adjacent drainage ways. 
    Geotechnical engineer is a professional engineer licensed by the Minnesota Board of Architecture, Engineering, Land Surveying, Landscape Architecture, Geoscience, and Interior Design to practice in the field of geotechnical engineering. 
    Geotechnical engineering is the application of the principles of soils mechanics in the investigation, evaluation and design of civil works involving the use of earth materials and the inspection and/or testing of the construction thereof. 
    Grade is the vertical location of the ground surface. 
    Existing grade is the grade prior to grading or land disturbing activities. 
    Rough grade is the stage at which the grade approximately conforms to the approved plan. 
    Finish grade is the final grade of the site, within 0.2 feet, that conforms to the approved plan. 
    Grading is any excavating or filling or combination thereof. 
    Hydric soils are soils that are saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper layers. 
    Hydrophytic vegetation is macrophytic (large enough to be observed by the naked eye) plant life growing in water, soil or on a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content. 
    Land disturbance activity is any land change that may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands within this government's jurisdiction, including construction, clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. 
    Permanent controls are long-term methods employed to prevent erosion and sedimentation. Examples of such protection are swales, ponds, sediment basins, turf reinforcement mats, storm sewer systems, and riprap. 
    Permanent cover means "final stabilization." Examples include grass, gravel, asphalt, and concrete. See also the definition of "final stabilization." 
    Permit is a written warrant or license granted for land disturbing activities. 
    Sediment is the product of an erosion process; solid material both mineral and organic, that is in suspension, is being transported, or has been moved by water, wind, or ice, and has come to rest on the earth's surface either above or below water level. 
    Sedimentation is the process or action of depositing sediment. 
    Sediment control is the methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving a site. Examples of sediment control practices are silt fences, sediment traps, earth dikes, drainage swales, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, storm drain inlet protection, and temporary or permanent sedimentation basins. 
    Site is any lot or parcel of land or contiguous combination thereof, under the same ownership, where a land disturbing activity is performed or permitted.

    Soil is naturally occurring superficial deposits overlying bedrock. 
    Stabilized shall mean the exposed ground surface after it has been covered by perennial vegetation, sod, erosion control blanket, riprap, pavement or other material that prevents erosion. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered stabilization. 
    Storm water as defined under Minnesota Rule 7077.0105, subpart 41b storm water, "means precipitation runoff, storm water runoff, snow melt runoff, and any other surface runoff and drainage." 
    Storm water pollution prevention plan is a joint storm water and erosion and sediment control plan that is a document containing the requirements of this chapter and the City of Woodbury Land Disturbance Plan and Implementation Requirements, that when implemented will decrease soil erosion on a parcel of land and off-site nonpoint pollution. It involves both temporary and permanent controls. 
    Temporary controls are short-term methods employed to prevent erosion and sedimentation. Examples of such protection are silt fence, temporary sediment basins, check dams, straw, mulch, erosion control blankets, wood chips, and erosion netting. 
    Terrace is a relatively level step constructed in the face of a graded slope surface for drainage and maintenance purposes. 
    Wetlands as defined in Minnesota Rules 7050.0130, subpart F, are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Constructed wetlands designed for wastewater treatment are not waters of the state. Wetlands must have the following attributes: 
(1)  A predominance of hydric soils; 
(2)  Inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in a saturated soil condition; and

If the city finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this chapter and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees and security requirements for said permit have been provided, the city may issue a permit to the applicant. When the city issues the permit where plans are required, the city shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications "Reviewed". Such reviewed plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the city, and all work shall be done in accordance with the reviewed plans. The city may issue a provisional permit for a land disturbing activity before the entire plans and specifications have been submitted or reviewed, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this chapter. The holder of such provisional permit shall proceed at his own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire project will be granted. The issuance of a land disturbance permit by the city does not exempt the applicant from the requirements and permitting authority of other agencies having jurisdiction over the work performed. 
(l)  Retention of plans. One set of reviewed plans, specifications and computations shall be retained by the city for a period of not less than one year from date of completion of the work covered therein; and one set of reviewed plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(m)  Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans, specifications and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of any other ordinance of the city. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter shall be valid. The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications and other data shall not prevent the city from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing land disturbing activities being carried on thereunder when in violation of this chapter or of any other ordinance of the city. 
(n)  Expiration. Every permit issued by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 90 days from the date of issuance of such permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee therefore shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work; and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which the permittee may commence work under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The city may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days upon written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from being taken. No permit shall be extended more than once. 
(o)  Suspension or revocation. The city may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or is found to be in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this chapter.

(1)  Whenever the city shall grade, regrade, or change the line of any public way or public ground, or construct or reconstruct any city utility system therein and shall, in the proper exercise of its police power, and with due regard to seasonable working conditions, when necessary, order the company to relocate permanently its lines, services and other property located in said public way or public ground, the company shall relocate its facilities at its own expense. The city shall give the company reasonable notice of plans to grade, regrade or change the line of any public way or public ground, or to construct or reconstruct any city utility system therein. However, after the company has so relocated, if a subsequent relocation or relocations shall be ordered within three years from and after first relocation, the city shall reimburse the company for such non-betterment relocation expense which the company may incur on a time and material basis; provided, if subsequent relocations are required because of the extension of city utilities to previously unserved areas, the company may be required to relocate at its own expense at any time. 
(2)  Unless the company otherwise notifies the city in writing of its inability to meet the time schedule within a time period, not less than 30 days, designated for a response set forth in the city's written directive to relocate, the company shall relocate its facilities within a time period, not less than 45 days, designated for completion of the directed relocation set forth in such written directive of the city. Nothing contained in this franchise shall require the company to relocate, remove, replace or reconnect at its own expense its facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconnection is for convenience and not of necessity in the construction or reconstruction of a city utility system or extension thereof. 
(3)  Any relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any company facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through the city of a federally aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 161.46 as supplemented or amended. 
(4)  Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person, persons, or corporations from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the company's facilities while performing any work connected with grading, regrading or changing the line of any public way, or with the construction of any city utility system. 
(f)  Indemnification. The company shall indemnify, keep, and hold the city free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of the company's electric facilities located in, on, over, under, or across the public ways and public grounds of the city, unless such injury or damage grows out of the negligence of the city, its employees, or agents, or results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by the company, but such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by the city after notice of the company's determination. In the event a suit shall be brought against the city under circumstances where the above agreement to indemnify applies, the company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the city in such suit. The city shall make every reasonable effort to provide the company with written notice thereof. If the company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have complete control of such litigation, but the company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the city; and the company, in defending any action on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf. 
(g)  Vacation of public ways. The city shall give the company at least two weeks' prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a public way or public ground. Except where required by the city the vacation of any public way or public ground, after the installation of electric facilities, shall not operate to deprive the company of its rights to operate and maintain such electric facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the company. In no case, however, shall the city be liable to the company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under Minn. Stats. § 160.29. The provisions hereof relating to public grounds apply only to facilities constructed in reliance on a franchise and the company does not waive its rights under an easement or prescriptive right. 
(h)  Nonexclusive. Nothing in this section shall be construed as giving to the company any exclusive privileges in, on, over, under or across the public ways or public grounds of the city, provided that the foregoing shall not be construed as a waiver of the company's exclusive service rights under Minn. Stats. § 216B.40. 
(i)  Franchise fee. 
(1)  Separate ordinance. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any permit or other fees being imposed on the company, the city may impose on the company a franchise fee of not more than four percent of the company's gross revenues as hereinafter defined. The franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the city council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least 30 days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon the company by certified mail. The fee shall not become effective until at least 60 days after written notice enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon the company by certified mail. Subsection (j)(2) of section 9-1 shall constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between the company and the city in regard to the interpretation of, or enforcement of, the separate ordinance. No action by the city to implement a separate ordinance will commence until this section is effective. No pre-existing ordinance imposing a fee shall be effective against the company unless it is specifically amended after the effective date of this section following the procedures of subsection (k) of section 9-1 for the adoption of a new separate ordinance. A separate ordinance which does not impose a uniform franchise fee on all revenues within the definition of gross revenues shall not be effective against the company. 
(2)  Terms defined. The term "gross revenues" means all sums, excluding any surcharge or similar addition to the company's charges to customers for the purpose of reimbursing the company for the cost resulting from the franchise fee, received by the company from the sale of electricity to its retail customers within the corporate limits of the city. 
(3)  Collection of the fee. The franchise fee shall be payable not less often than quarterly, and shall be based on the gross revenues of the company during complete billing months during the period for which payment is to be made. The payment shall be due the last business day of the month following the period for which the payment is made. The percent fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however, each change shall meet the notice requirements and the percentage may not be changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any amount which the company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to the city by imposing a surcharge equivalent to such fee in its rates for electric service. The company may pay the city the fee based upon the surcharge billed subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles or customer refunds. The time and manner of collecting the franchise fee is subject to the approval of the public utilities commission, which the company agrees to use best efforts to obtain. The company agrees to make its gross revenues records available for inspection by the city at reasonable times. 
(4)  Conditions on the fee. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against the company unless it lawfully imposes and the city, quarterly, or more often, collects a fee or tax of the same or greater percentage on the receipts from sales of energy within the city by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the city has the authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax. The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating, cooling, or lighting, as well as to the supply of energy needed to run machinery and appliances on premises located within or adjacent to the city, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel for vehicles. If the company specifically consents in writing to a franchise or separate ordinance collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy supplier in contravention of subsection (j) of section 9-1, the foregoing conditions will be waived to the extent of such written consent. 
(j)  Construction, interpretation of section provisions. 
(1)  Every subsection, provision or part of this section is declared separate from every other subsection, provision, or part; and if any subsection, provision or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other subsection, provision or part. Where a provision of any other city ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this section, the provisions of this section shall prevail. 
(2)  If either party (city or company) asserts that the other party is in default in performance of any obligation hereunder, the complaining party shall notify the other party of the default and the desired remedy. The notification shall be written. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the written notice, either party may commence an action in district court to interpret and enforce this franchise or for such other relief as may be permitted by law or equity for breach of contract, or either party may take any other action permitted by law. 
(3)  This section constitutes a franchise agreement between the city and the company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. 
(k)  Written acceptance. The company shall, if it accepts Ordinance No. 1535, from which this section derives, and the rights and obligations hereby granted, file a written acceptance of the rights hereby granted with the city clerk within 90 days after the final passage and any required publication of Ordinance No. 1535. 
(l)  Publication expense. The expense of any publications of franchise ordinance required by law shall be paid by the company. 
(m)  Effective date. This section shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and publication as provided by law and upon acceptance by the company as provided in subsection (k) of section 9-1.

Nothing contained in this franchise shall require the company to relocate, remove, replace or reconnect at its own expense its facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement, or reconnection is for convenience and not of necessity in the construction or reconstruction of a city utility system or extension thereof. 
(3)  Any relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any company facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through the city of a federally aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 161.46 as supplemented or amended.

If the company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have complete control of such litigation, but the company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

The notice of default shall be in writing and shall specify the provisions of this franchise under which the default is claimed and state the basis therefor. Such notice shall be served on the company by personally delivering it to an officer thereof at its principal place of business in Minnesota. 
If the company is in default as to any part of this franchise, the municipality may, after reasonable notice to the company and the failure of the company to cure the default within a reasonable time, take such action as may be reasonably necessary to abate the condition caused by the default, and the company agrees to reimburse the municipality for all its reasonable costs and for its costs of collection, including attorneys' fees. 
Nothing in this section shall bar the company from challenging the municipality's claim that a default has occurred. In the event of disagreement over the existence of a default, the burden of proving the default shall be on the municipality. 
(c)  Conditions of use. 
(1)  Use of public ground. All utility facilities and equipment of the company shall be located, constructed, installed, and maintained so as not to endanger or unnecessarily interfere with the usual and customary traffic, travel, and use of public ground, and shall be subject to permit conditions of the municipality. The permit conditions may provide for the right of inspection by the municipality, and the company agrees to make its facilities and equipment available for inspection at all reasonable times and places. 
(2)  Permit required. The company shall not open or disturb the surface of any public ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the municipality, for which the municipality may impose a reasonable fee to be paid by the company. The permit conditions imposed on the company shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work.

The company shall promptly, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate its facilities or equipment whenever the municipality orders such relocation. If the relocation is a result of the proper exercise of the police power in grading, regrading, changing the location or shape of or otherwise improving any public ground or constructing or reconstructing any building sewer or water system therein, the relocation shall be at the expense of the company. If the relocation is not a result of the proper exercise of the police power, the relocation shall be at the expense of the municipality. If such relocation is done without an agreement first being made as to who shall pay the relocation cost, such relocation of the facilities by the company shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to be reimbursed for the relocation costs. If the company claims that it should be reimbursed for such relocation costs, it shall notify the municipality within 30 days after receipt of such order. The municipality shall give the company reasonable notice of plans requiring such relocation. 
Nothing contained in this subsection shall require the company to remove and replace its mains or to cut and reconnect its service pipe running from the main to the customer's premises at its own expense where the removal and replacement or cutting and reconnecting is made for the purpose of a more expeditious operation for the construction and reconstruction of underground facilities; nor shall anything contained herein relieve any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging the company's facilities while performing any work in any public ground. 
(5)  Relocation when public ground vacated. The vacation of any public ground shall not operate to deprive the company of the right to operate and maintain its facilities therein.

When the vacation is for the benefit of the municipality in the furtherance of a public purpose, the company shall relocate at its own expense.

The notice shall be given to the company a sufficient length of time, considering seasonable working conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit the company to make any additions, alterations or repairs to its facilities the company deems necessary. 
In cases where streets are at final width and grade, and the municipality has installed underground sewer and water mains and service connections to the property line abutting the streets prior to a permanent paving or resurfacing of such streets, and the company's main is located under such street, the company may be required to install gas service connections prior to such paving or resurfacing, whenever it is apparent that gas service will be required during the five years following the paving or resurfacing. 
(d)  Indemnification. The company shall indemnify, keep and hold the municipality, and its elected officials, officers, employees, and agents free and harmless from any and all claims and actions on account of injury or death of persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, removal, or operation of the company's property located in, on, over, under, or across the public ground of the municipality, unless such injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the municipality, its elected officials, employees, officers, or agents. The municipality shall not be entitled to reimbursement for its costs incurred prior to notification to the company of claims or actions and a reasonable opportunity for the company to accept and undertake the defense. 
    If a claim or action shall be brought against the municipality under circumstances where indemnification applies, the company, at its sole cost and expense, shall defend the municipality if written notice of the claim or action is promptly given to the company within a period wherein the company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. The company shall have complete control of such claim or action, but it may not settle without the consent of the municipality, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(Ord. No. 1835, § 1835.01, 12-8-2010) 
Sec. 11-2. - Criminal history license background investigations. 
    The Woodbury Police Department is hereby authorized, as the exclusive entity within the city, to do a criminal history background investigation on the applicants for the following licenses within the city: 
Liquor licenses; 
Massage therapy business; 
Massage therapist; 
Peddler licenses;

    In conducting the criminal history background investigation on license applicants, the police department is authorized to access data maintained in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehensions Computerized Criminal History information system in accordance with BCA policies as are established from time to time. Any data that is accessed and acquired shall be maintained at the police department under the care and custody of the chief law enforcement official or his or her designee. A summary of the results of the computerized criminal history data may be released by the police department to the licensing authority, including the city council, the city clerk, or other city staff involved in the license approval process. 
    Before the investigation is undertaken, the applicant must authorize the police department by written consent to undertake the investigation. The written consent must fully comply with the provisions of M.S. Ch. 13 regarding the collection, maintenance and use of the information. 
    All licenses under this chapter shall have a continuing obligation as a condition of the license to report to the city clerk the issuance of a complaint for or conviction on any criminal charges for offenses identified within the license eligibility sections of this code for which the licensee is the named party within a judicial proceeding.

ARTICLE II. - TOBACCO SALES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1880, § 1, adopted June 25, 2014 , repealed the former Art. II, §§ 11-16-11-29, and enacted a new Art. II as set out herein. The former Art. II pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1985, §§ 1504.01-1504.06; Ord. No. 1567, §§ 1567.02, 1567.03, 4-24-91; Ord. No. 1664, § 1664.01, 1-14-98; Ord. No. 1820, § 1820.01, 5-27-09. 

Sec. 11-16. - Purpose. 
    Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices and nicotine or lobelia delivery devices, and such sales, possession and use are violations of both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several severe health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery devices, and to further the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stats. § 144.391, public policy.

ARTICLE XI. - ADULT USES 

Sec. 11-300. - Statement of policy. 
    The city council of the City of Woodbury deems it necessary to provide for the special and express regulation of businesses or commercial enterprises which operate as adult body painting studios, adult bookstores, adult cabarets, adult companionship establishments, adult hotels or motels, adult massage parlors or health clubs, adult mini-motion picture theaters, adult modeling studios, adult motion picture arcades or theaters, adult novelty businesses, adult saunas, and similar adult oriented services operating under different names in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and to guard against the inception and transmission of disease. The city council further finds that the commercial enterprises such as the types described above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized training are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening, subverting, or endangering the morals of the community by being the site of acts of prostitution, illicit sex, and occasions of violent crimes, and thus requiring close inspection, licensing and regulation. 
    The city council also finds that control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types, in view of the abuses often perpetrated, require intensive efforts by the police department and other departments of the city. As a consequence, the concentrated use of city services in such control detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare, morals and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide numerous services to all segments of the community without a concentration of public services in one area working to the detriment of the members of the general public, it is hereby decided that the above described uses should be limited to the FD/4 zoning district as a special use and as a permitted accessory use in the B-2, B-3, FD-1, FD-3 and FD-4 zoning districts, and should require the issuance of licenses

(1)  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in juvenile victimization and crime. At the same time, the crimes committed by and against juveniles have become more violent. A significant percentage of juvenile crime occurs during curfew hours. 
(2)  Because of their lack of maturity and experience, juveniles are particularly susceptible to becoming victims of older perpetrators. The younger a person is, the more likely he or she is to be victim of crime. 
(3)  While parents have the primary responsibility to provide for the safety and welfare of juveniles, Woodbury also has a substantial interest in the safety and welfare of juveniles. Moreover, Woodbury has an interest in preventing juvenile crime, promoting parental supervision, and providing for the well being of the general public.

a.  Slopes on interior or working portions of the pit shall be at one foot horizontal to one foot vertical. 
b.  Slopes or any edge contiguous to property owned by others or railroads shall be four feet horizontal to one foot vertical. 
(3)  The owner or applicant prevent water runoff damage, including erosion on adjacent property and the deposit of material by water run-off on adjacent property. 
(4)  The owner or applicant employ all reasonable means to reduce dust, noise and nuisances, including but not limited to spraying the material that is being processed with water. 
(5)  The applicant or owner shall plant suitable and fast growing screening trees which shall be a minimum of six feet high placed in two rows staggered with trees not more than ten feet apart in each row, when necessary to eliminate unsightly view of the operations. 
(6)  On completion of the operation, the applicant shall properly drain and level off any pit and restore the contour of the site of the operation to a condition that is as indicated on the plan submitted and approved. Such condition must not adversely affect the surrounding land or future development of the site on which the operation was conducted. Upon closing operations or leaving any particular excavation or area in the site, the applicant shall re-grade that area which they have excavated or disturbed in order that no slopes are in excess of three feet horizontal to one foot vertical. 
(7)  The applicant or owner shall remove any extracted material upon and along the highways, streets, and other public ways in the city as the city engineer shall order and direct. 
(8)  The applicant or owner shall reimburse the city for the cost or periodic inspections by the city engineer, or other city employee, for the purpose of seeing that the terms under which the permit has been issued are being complied with.

Any emission which can cause any damage to health, animals or vegetation or other forms of property or which can cause any excessive soiling at any point or any emission of any solid or liquid particles in concentrations exceeding state pollution control agency air quality regulations shall be prohibited. 
(17)  No noise resulting from the excavation use shall exceed the most current state pollution control agency noise control regulations. These regulations shall not apply to incidental traffic or maintenance operations. 
All equipment run by fossil fuels and used in the operation of any gravel pit in the city shall be equipped at all times with a muffler in good working order which blends the exhaust noise into the overall noise of said equipment and is in constant operation to prevent excessive or unusual noise. The exhaust system of such equipment shall not emit or produce a sharp, popping, or crackling sound. 
(18)  Any vibration resulting in any combination of amplitude and frequencies beyond the "safe" range of the most current standards of the United States Bureau of Mines for any structure shall be prohibited. 
(19)  All top soil shall be stripped from the entire mining area and stockpiled for use in reclamation of the site. Under no circumstances shall the top soil be removed from the site.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 18.5-1. - Citation. 
    This chapter may be cited as the "Woodbury Sign Ordinance" or as the "sign ordinance". 
(Ord. No. 1641, § 1641.02, 1-10-96) 
Sec. 18.5-2. - Findings. 
(a)  Signs are an essential element of any community. Their location, number, size, design and relationship to each other and to other structures has a significant influence upon a community's appearance and welfare, and a resultant effect upon a viewer's perception of the community. Signs serve a useful purpose in communicating a message, whether commercial or otherwise. 
(b)  Where signs are not properly regulated, they contribute to visual clutter, confusion, aesthetic blight, and create an unpleasant impression. They may cause traffic hazards and impede rather than enhance commerce. In such situations, signs may fail to achieve their original objective of communication. Failure to appropriately regulate signs adversely affects the public health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  Property and facilities located within the public right-of-way, such as utility poles, benches, hydrants, bridges, sidewalks, traffic sign posts, and similar structures are not by tradition or designation a forum for communication by the general public. The city wishes to preserve these structures for their intended purpose, which is the safe, efficient and pleasant movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and the safe operation of utility systems. 
(d)  The regulations and prohibitions of the chapter are necessary to preserve items and structures located within the public right-of-way for their intended purposes, and to prevent the visual clutter, blight, and traffic hazards caused by signs.

Sec. 19-10. - Duties and obligations of licensed collector.

(1)  Operating procedures. A licensee shall operate in a manner consistent with its application materials and provide notice to the city within 15 days of any change of information, forms, rate structures, or certificates filed as a part of the license application process except for the 30-day notice requirement on insurance as found in subsection (5) of section 19-8. 
(2)  Compliance with laws and regulations. The licensee shall comply with all state, county, and local laws and regulations. 
(3)  Collection days and hours. Licensed haulers shall comply with garbage, other refuse, yard waste, white goods, and recyclable collection days and hours as specified in section 19-9. 
(4)  Vehicles and equipment. Each licensed collector shall only use vehicles and equipment so constructed that the contents shall not leak or spill. The vehicle's equipment shall also be kept clean and as free from offensive odors as possible, and shall not stand on any street, alley, or public place longer than is reasonably necessary to collect garbage, refuse, yard waste, and/or recyclables. The licensee shall also ensure that the collection site is left tidy and free of litter; each licensed collector shall provide its customers with the opportunity to recycle through a weekly curbside collection of targeted recyclables (as defined in section 19-1 and by resolution of the city council hereinafter adopted). Haulers may collect recyclables every two weeks subject to the conditions defined in section 19-8(4)a. The curbside collection of targeted recyclables shall be on the same day as collection of customer's garbage and refuse collection, but may occur at a different time within that day. The targeted recyclable collection shall be from a location at or near the customer's garbage and other refuse collection site, or at such other location as mutually agreeable to the hauler and the customer. The licensee may specify how the customers are to place and prepare their targeted recyclables for collection. The licensee is also deemed the owner of recyclables and upon collection the licensee may market them. Nothing herewithin shall construe to prevent the licensee from offering curbside collection for other recyclable materials in addition to the targeted recyclables. 
(5)  Reports. Single-family and multiple residential licensees shall report to the city information as required on a form provided for such purpose. The report shall be submitted quarterly, before the 15th day of the month following the close of the quarter. Haulers are required to report information as specified by the county and/or the city. Haulers shall be required to demonstrate that they have disposed of garbage, other refuse, and white goods at a disposal facility as designated by the county. White goods may be disposed of through a reclamation center. Haulers are required to demonstrate that they have recycled the targeted recyclables. Upon request, haulers shall produce weight slips which shall verify and certify the amount of garbage, other refuse, and recyclables reported to the city. Failure to certify accurate weights may be cause for revocation of the hauling license. 
(6)  Commingled recylcables. It shall be permissible for licensed haulers to commingle recyclables provided, however, that haulers who do so shall provide to each customer, at least annually, the following information: 
a.  That while the recyclables are commingled during collection, they are later separated and recycled; and 
b.  A description of the recycling process.

(b)  Every owner, operator or lessee of an industrial and/or commercial business who provides his own garbage and/or recycling containers shall keep the containers in a storage area or building which can be locked except on the day of collection. Every owner, operator, or lessee of an industrial and/or commercial business who uses a container provided by the licensed private collector shall keep the container so located as to be out of the public view as far as possible except on the day of pickup. Containers shall not be filled to the extent that the garbage or refuse placed therein can drop or spill from them. 
(c)  All containers for garbage, other refuse, and yard waste shall be made of metal or other suitable material, which is rodent-, fire-, and waterproof and which will not easily corrode and shall be of such size and weight that they can be handled by one person, and kept tightly closed.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1750, § 1750.01, adopted July 14, 2004, amended article IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article IV, §§ 20-60-20-63, pertained to street cleaning, and derived from Ord. No. 1550, § 1550.01, 5-23-90. 

Sec. 20-60. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to insure that city streets remain reasonably clean and free from debris and hazards. Excessive debris and materials on streets creates hazardous driving conditions and builds up in the storm sewer system creating expensive maintenance conditions and eventually ends up in the ponds and lakes of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1750, § 1750.01, 7-14-2004) 
Sec. 20-61. - Debris and hazards. 
    For purposes of this article, debris and hazards may include, but is not limited to the following materials: Garbage, dirt, landscaping products, construction materials, driveway sealer, paint, concrete truck washout, dumpsters, portable on demand storage (PODS) units, grass clippings, leaves, snow, automotive fluids, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer, pet waste or any other foreign matter covered under chapter 15, nuisances. 
    No person, firm or corporation shall deposit or allow to be deposited any debris or hazard on the city streets or roads. All debris and hazards, placed on a public street are considered a public nuisance. The owner or occupant of the property adjacent to a public street shall use due diligence to keep such street clean from debris and hazards. No such owner or occupant shall allow debris or hazards to remain on a public street for any period of time. 
(Ord. No. 1750, § 1750.01, 7-14-2004) 
Sec. 20-62. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  The offending party will be given a citation for the unsatisfactory condition. The offending party shall clean the debris or hazard immediately or within the time limits as dictated by the city. The offending party will also sweep all residual material from the streets to prevent discharge of materials to the storm sewer system. The "offending party" will be the person, firm or corporation on site with the materials or the owner or occupant of the property responsible for the debris or hazard. 
(b)  If the unsatisfactory condition is not corrected within the specified period of time, the city shall remove such debris or hazard from the public street as soon as possible after such notice has been given or such material has been deposited on the public street. The materials will be moved to city owned property and held for a period of 72 hours. The offending party can retrieve the materials during that period and must coordinate the retrieval schedule with the city. If materials are not claimed within 72 hours, the City of Woodbury will dispose of the materials. The city shall keep a record showing the cost of such removal and disposal adjacent to each separate lot and parcel and shall be kept on record with the city clerk. 
(c)  The owner or occupant of the property on which or adjacent to which said clean-up service has been performed, or the company performing the work that resulted in the debris being deposited shall be liable for the cost of said service. As soon as a service has been completed and the cost determined, the city shall prepare a bill and mail it to the owner or occupant of said property, and thereupon, the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the city clerk. Such bill shall include all costs of the clean-up, including related traffic warning signage, the cost of disposal if necessary and the administrative costs of the city. 
(d)  The city may also enforce Minn. Stats. § 169.42 with the maximum penalty for a misdemeanor as prescribed by state law. 
(e)  If the bill is not paid within 30 days, the city may draw the amount of the bill from any financial guarantees the city may hold or may assess the property from which the offense originated. 
(f)  On or before September 1 of each year, the city clerk shall list the total unpaid charges for such clean-ups against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable to under this article. After notice and hearing as provided pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 429.061, the city council may then spread the charges against the property benefited as a special assessment under Minn. Stats. § 429.101 for certification to the county auditor and collection along with the current taxes the following year or in annual installations not exceeding ten as the council may determine in each case. 
(Ord. No. 1750, § 1750.01, 7-14-2004) 
Sec. 20-63. - Hazardous conditions. 
    Nothing in this article shall prevent the city from correcting a hazardous or unsafe condition without prior notice to the offending party. Reimbursement for such work pursuant to this section shall be outlined in section 20-62.

Sec. 20-75. - Right-of-way patching and restoration. 
(a)  Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under section 20-79. 
(b)  Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the surface portion of the right-of-way or to restore the surface portion of the right-of-way itself. 
(1)  City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way surface, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such Restoration, the pavement or any part of the right-of-way settles within 24 months following such restoration due to permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the defective work. 
(2)  Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way itself, it shall at the time of application for an Excavation permit post a 24-month construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota Rule 7819.3000. 
(3)  Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However, the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for replacing and compacting the subgrade and aggregate base material and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities. 
(c)  Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and shall comply with Minnesota Rule 7819.1100. All restoration of paved and turf surfaces shall be in accordance with PUC standard plates. 
(d)  Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in patching, or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. Permittee upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be completed promptly upon receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under section 20-79. 
(e)  Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the city shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific alleged failures and shall allow the permittee at least five working days from the receipt of notice to cure the failure or failures or to respond with a plan to cure. In the event the permittee fails to cure or fails to respond to the notice, the city may at its option perform the necessary work and the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond.

(Ord. No. 1745, 3-10-2004) 
Sec. 20-77. - Supplementary applications. 
(a)  Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area (i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension. 
(b)  Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date. Permits for non-emergency work shall be submitted at least 72 hours prior to the planned start of work unless engineering allows a different duration. 
(Ord. No. 1745, 3-10-2004) 
Sec. 20-78. - Other obligations. 
(a)  Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minn. Stats. §§ 216D.01-216D.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560 (location of utility laterals within public right-of-way).

(c)  Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit. Traffic control shall conform to the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, including the Temporary Traffic Control Zones Field Manual and any directions of the city director. 
(d)  Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permitees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in Minn. Stats. Ch. 216D and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing utilities, in order to determine the precise location of marked underground utilities before excavating. In addition, permitees employing trenchless excavation methods, shall not install facilities at a depth greater than four feet below grade, unless specifically approved by the director.

(2)  The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work which does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to section 20-84. 
(3)  The cost of any action taken by the city shall be paid by the permittee. 
(4)  The director may require that the permittee immediately cease work if the permittee has recently performed work without regard for public safety. Such work without regard for public safety may include, but not be limited to, causing by means of work within the right of way, damage to two or more utility facilities within 48 hours or damage to three or more utility facilities within one week. Should such work without regard for public safety occur, the director reserves the right to require: 
a.  That the permittee cease work immediately; 
b.  Prepare a new safety plan to prevent future occurrences; 
c.  Present said safety plan to the director or the director's staff for approval 24 hours after the order to cease work;

Sec. 20-82. - Work done without a permit. 
(a)  Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this article for the actions it took in response to the emergency. 
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding the registrant's facilities, the city will contact the registrant's emergency telephone number as registered with the city or listed in the telephone directory. The city will make the area safe, as necessary. If there is no response from registrant, the city may take whatever action deemed necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the permittee or registrant whose facility occasioned the emergency. 
(b)  Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the City Code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1745, 3-10-2004)

The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit; 
(4)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; 
(5)  The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 20-81; 
(6)  Failure to pay any required costs, fees, or charges billed by the city; or 
(7)  Failure to provide traffic control that conforms to the provisions of the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, including the Temporary Traffic Control Zones Field Manual. 
(b)  Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at the city's discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. 
(c)  Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, may automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year. 
(d)  Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of the permit authorization. 
(e)  Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs. 
(f)  Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

Sec. 20-85. - Mapping data. 
(a)  Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minnesota Rules 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. All existing and new facilities shall be shown. 
(b)  Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the use of appropriate means of establishing the vertical and horizontal locations of installed service laterals, to the extent technically feasible as determined by the director. Permitees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision (b) and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a condition to city approval of 1) payment to contractors working on a city improvement project including those under Minn. Stats. ch. 429, and 2) city approval of performance under development agreements, or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minn. Stats. ch. 462. Each utility shall utilize the appropriate means and methods of providing to the city accurate location of the newly-installed, or applicable repair to, service laterals, subject to the approval of the director. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the city's withholding of applicable approvals or in the revocation of the permit issued for the applicable work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractor.

The city may assign specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. 
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the registrant. 
(c)  Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.

(a)  Reservation of right. In accordance with Minn. Rule 7819.3200, if the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities or equipment of a registrant or right-of-way user and the right-of-way vacation does not require the relocation of the right-of-way user's facilities, the local government unit shall, except when it would not be in the public interest, reserve to and for itself and all right-of-way users having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain, and operate facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon the right-of-way at any time to reconstruct, inspect, maintain, or repair the facilities. 
(b)  Relocation of equipment or facilities. If the vacation requires the relocation of registrant or permittee equipment or facilities; and (a) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the registrant or permittee, the registrant or permittee must pay the relocation costs; or (b) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the registrant or permittee must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city and the registrant or permittee; or (c) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons other than the registrant or permittee, such other person or persons must pay the relocation costs.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 21-1. - Citation. 
    This chapter may be cited as the "Woodbury Subdivision Ordinance" or as the "Subdivision Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 1864, § 1864.01, 11-14-2012) 
Sec. 21-2. - Introduction. 
(a)  In the course of development, on a large or small scale, land holdings are divided into lots, with provision for access, possibly by new streets, provision for basic utilities or private sewer and water facilities, and the like. The final land development is greatly dependent on the very basic steps taken in drawing the lot lines, the street right-of-way, and so on. For the best results, it may be wise to combine parcels of land, to divide others, or to totally revise the lot lines of a tract of land. The subdivision, combination or resubdivision of land is the first step in shaping the physical character of a community's development and as such all are important processes which should be subject to public regulation. 
(b)  The conversion of land into building sites is a process which requires careful regulation to ensure an attractive, efficient and safe community environment. Provision must be made for adequate and safe water and sewer facilities; the system of neighborhood streets must provide convenient access without dangerous intersections; procedures must be developed to allow the public acquisition of needed land for community facilities; and other improvements must be required to be consistent with the general public welfare and safety. Provision must also be made for possible future resubdivision, after a subdivision of a land parcel has been approved and buildings permitted; the same standards should be met by any such future resubdivision. 
(c)  Each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic physical structure of the community, a unit to which the future community will of necessity be forced to adhere. Piecemeal planning of such subdivisions, without correlation to a plan, will bring a disconnected patchwork of plats and poor circulation of traffic. So that new subdivisions contribute toward an attractive, orderly, stable and wholesome community environment, adequate municipal services and efficient movement of traffic, all subdivisions platted within the jurisdiction of the city, shall, in all aspects, fully comply with this chapter. In their interpretation and application the provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 1864, § 1864.01, 11-14-2012) 
Sec. 21-3. - Relationship to the comprehensive plan. 
    It is the intent of the City of Woodbury that the enforcement, amendment, and administration of this chapter be accomplished consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, as may be amended from time to time. The city council recognizes the comprehensive plan as the official policy plan for the regulation of land use and development in accordance with the plan's vision and guiding principles which include: 
(a)  Making Woodbury sustainable. 
(b)  Providing a safe and healthy community. 
(c)  Managing growth. 
(d)  Preserving open space. 
(e)  Providing for parks and recreation. 
(f)  Planning for an effective transportation system. 
(g)  Meeting community housing needs. 
(h)  Managing financial resources. 
(i)  Expanding opportunities for employment and maintaining a business-friendly environment. 
(j)  Promoting reinvestment. 
(k)  Promoting excellence in education. 
(l)  Maintaining a positive identity as an open and inviting community with respect to diversity. 
(m)  Providing excellence in city government. 
    In accordance with M.S. Ch. 473, the city will not approve any changes in these regulations that are not consistent with the city's comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 1864, § 1864.01, 11-14-2012) 
Sec. 21-4. - Intent and purpose. 
    This chapter is adopted for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare through the establishment of minimum regulations governing subdivisions of land. Such regulations are established with the intent to: 
(a)  Implement the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Ensure that subdivisions are consistent with all applicable plans, laws and regulations. 
(c)  Provide for the orderly subdivision of land and to ensure proper legal descriptions and monumentation of subdivided land. 
(d)  Ensure that adequate public infrastructure, facilities and services are available concurrent with development. 
(e)  Conserve and protect the natural resources and scenic beauty of the city.

Sec. 23-75. - Industrial user strength sewer surcharge. 
(a)  Purpose. The metropolitan waste control commission, a metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the state in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and regulations thereunder, hereinafter referred to as the "act", has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the metropolitan disposal system as defined in Minn. Stats. § 473.121, subd. 24, to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city. Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3, empowers the city to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served. 
(b)  Establishment. For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each year by the commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each person, company or corporation receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the city, hereinafter referred to as the strength charge. 
(c)  Formula. For the purpose of computation of the strength charge, there is established in compliance with the act the same strength charge formula designated in Resolution No. 76-172, adopted by the governing body of the commission on June 15, 1976. Such formula is based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the commission. 
(d)  Payment. The strength charge shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject thereto before the twentieth day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to such user by or on behalf of the city. Payment shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. If such payment is not paid before such date the industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate of two-thirds of one percent per month on the unpaid balance due. 
(e)  Tax lien. If the strength charge is not paid before the 60th day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, it, plus accrued interest established pursuant to subsection (d) hereof, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the city or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall not preclude the city or its agent from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy. 
(Code 1985, §§ 1111.18-1111.22) 
Sec. 23-76. - Waste traps and separators. 
(a)  Oil, grease, and sand waste traps and separators shall be installed for the proper discharge of wastewater containing excessive amounts of oil, grease, sand, or flammable liquids when required by the Minnesota Plumbing Code, Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4715, the Regional Administrator of the Metropolitan Council, or when the city determines such traps or separators are necessary. 
(b)  Waste traps and separators shall be maintained in efficient operating conditions by the owner and at the owner's expense, through the periodic removal of any accumulated residue. Failure to maintain traps and separators may result in an administrative fine as set by council resolution. If a trap or separator is not properly maintained, the city may have the system, including affected city sewers, cleaned at the owner's expense.

DIVISION 2. - NONCONFORMING USES 

Sec. 24-31. - Intent. 
    Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures and uses of land, which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(Mins. of 6-27-2001; Ord. No. 1854, § 1854.01, 6-27-2012) 
Sec. 24-32. - Nonconforming uses or structures. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided by law, any nonconformity, any structure or use existing on April 14, 1971 or on the effective date of the adoption of an amendment to this chapter which does not conform to the provisions of this chapter may be continued, including repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement, but not including expansion, unless: 
(1)  The nonconformity is discontinued for a period of more than 12 months; or 
(2)  A nonconforming structure is damaged by fire or other peril to the extent of more than 50 percent of its estimated market value as indicated by the records of the county assessor at the time of damage, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In this case, reasonable conditions may be imposed upon a zoning or building permit to mitigate any newly created impacts on adjacent properties or water bodies. 
The owner shall provide a value estimate to restore the structure to minimum code standards. The value estimate shall include all costs related to the restoration including but not limited to the cost of all materials, labor and services. The percent of market value damage shall be established by the city. 
(b)  No such use or structure shall be expanded or enlarged except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Any further use shall be in conformity with the regulations of this chapter. 
(c)  Normal maintenance of a nonconforming use and structure is permitted. Maintenance may include necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not enlarge or intensify the nonconforming use. 
(d)  Buildings found to be nonconforming only by reason of height or setback requirements may be exempt from the provisions of this section. 
(e)  The enforcing officer may conduct an inspection on a periodic basis of any or all nonconforming uses and report his findings to the city council for appropriate action. 
(f)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a), repair, replacement, maintenance, improvement, or expansion of nonconforming uses and structures in floodplain areas shall be regulated to the extent necessary to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and not increase flood damage potential or increase the degree of obstruction to flood flows in the floodway. 
(Mins. of 6-27-2001; Ord. No. 1854, § 1854.01, 6-27-2012) 
Sec. 24-33. - Nonconforming shoreland structures and lots. 
(a)  When a nonconforming structure in the shoreland district with less than 50 percent of the required setback from the water is destroyed by fire or other peril to greater than 50 percent of its estimated market value, as indicated in the records of the county assessor at the time of damage, the structure setback may be increased if practicable. Reasonable conditions may be placed upon a zoning or building permit to mitigate created impacts on adjacent properties or water bodies. 
(b)  Shoreland lots of record in the office of the county recorder on the date of adoption of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements for lot size or lot width are subject to the following as it relates to the repair, replacement, maintenance, improvement or expansion of nonconforming uses and structures in shoreland areas: 
(1)  A nonconforming single lot of record located within a shoreland area may be allowed as a building site without variances from lot size requirements provided that: 
a.  All structure and septic system setback distance requirements can be met; and 
b.  A Type 1 sewage treatment system consistent with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7080, can be installed or the lot is connected to a public sewer; and 
c.  The impervious surface coverage does not exceed 25 percent of the lot. 
(2)  In a group of two or more contiguous lots of record under a common ownership, an individual lot will be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purpose of sale or development, if it meets the following requirements: 
a.  The lot must be at least 66 percent of the dimensional standard for lot width and lot size for the shoreland classification consistent with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 6120; and 
b.  The lot must be connected to a public sewer, if available, or must be suitable for the installation of a Type 1 sewage treatment system consistent with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7080; and 
c.  Impervious surface coverage must not exceed 25 percent of each lot; and 
d.  Development of the lot must be consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. 
(3)  A lot subject to paragraph (2) not meeting the requirements of paragraph (2) must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more conforming lots as much as possible. 
(4)  Notwithstanding paragraph (2), contiguous nonconforming lots of record in shoreland areas under a common ownership must be able to be sold or purchased individually if each lot contained a habitable residential dwelling at the time the lots came under common ownership and the lots are suitable for, or served by, a sewage treatment system consistent with the requirements of Section 115.55 and Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7080, or connected to a public sewer. 
(c)  In evaluating all variances, zoning and building permit applications, or conditional use requests, the zoning authority shall require the property owner to address, when appropriate, stormwater runoff management, reducing impervious surfaces, increasing setback, restoration of wetlands, vegetative buffers, sewage treatment and water supply capabilities, and other conservation-designed actions. 
(d)  A portion of a conforming lot may be separated from an existing parcel as long as the remainder of the existing parcel meets the lot size and sewage treatment requirements of the zoning district for a new lot and the newly created parcel is combined with an adjacent parcel.

(1) Unless approval is obtained from the Minnesota State Archeologist's office. 
(2) Exceptions are permitted without a variance in residential districts where structures exist on both lots adjoining a proposed building site and the building is not located on a steep slope or within a shore impact zone. In no case shall a structure be built closer to the OHWL than the average of the two adjoining structures. 
(3) Except for public crossings of public waters; roads, driveways and parking areas shall meet the minimum structure setback. Where no alternative exists, such improvements may be placed within the required structure setback provided they are designed to adapt to the natural landscape, soil erosion is minimized, and no construction shall occur within bluff or shore impact zones. 
(4) Commercial, industrial, public and semi-public uses with public waters frontage shall be setback double the required setback from the OHWL or be substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
(5) Or, if data are not available, three feet above the OHWL for the lowest floor elevation. 
(6) Sum of all impervious surfaces including, but not limited to, building roofs, parking surfaces, sidewalks, driveways and patios. 
(7) Lot width requirements shall be met at both the OHWL and building line. 
(8) Lot sizes shall not be modified except by PUD. 
(e)  Subdivision standards. The following standards shall apply to subdivisions in shoreland areas: 
(1)  Each lot created through subdivision must be suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. In determining suitability the city will consider susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision, or of the community at large. 
(2)  Subdivisions must conform to all other official controls adopted by the City of Woodbury. Subdivisions will not be approved that are designed so variances from one or more standards in official controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose. 
(3)  If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of this section, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the requirement of this section as much as possible. 
(f)  Agricultural activities. The following standards shall apply to agricultural activities in shoreland areas: 
(1)  The shore impact for parcels with permitted agricultural uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the OHWL. 
(2)  General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes and shore impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan (resource management systems) consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district or the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
(3)  Feedlots and manure storage are not permitted within the shoreland of watercourses or in bluff impact zones, and must meet a minimum setback of 300 feet from the ordinary high water level of all public water basins identified in subsection (b). 
(4)  The use of pesticides, fertilizers or animal wastes within shoreland areas shall be done in such a way as to minimize impacts on shore impact zones by proper application or use of earth or vegetation. 
(g)  Shoreland alterations. The purpose of this section is to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent back slumping and protect fish and wildlife habitat. Shoreland alterations shall be allowed in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  No principal or accessory structure or use shall be placed within bluff or shore impact zones other than agricultural activities as permitted by subsection (f)(2). 
(2)  Shore impact zones shall be maintained in permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district. 
(3)  Intensive vegetation clearing within shore and bluff impact zones and/or steep slopes is not permitted. Intensive clearing within shoreland areas, but outside of these areas, is permitted subject to city approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan that is consistent with chapter 7 of the City Code, land disturbance and sediment and erosion control. 
(4)  Limited clearing of trees and shrubs and the cutting, pruning and trimming of trees within bluff and shore impact zones or steep slopes to accommodate picnic areas, trails and water access and to provide a view to the water from a principal dwelling site shall be permitted provided the screening of structures, as viewed from the water, is not substantially reduced. These provisions do not apply to the removal of tree limbs or branches that are dead or pose a safety hazard. 
(5)  Any grading or filling on steep slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones involving the movement of ten or more cubic yards of material or involving more than 50 cubic yards of material elsewhere in a shoreland area shall require the submission of a shore impact plan. Approval shall be granted only if the following conditions are met: 
a.  Any filling or grading in any Type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 wetland shall be in conformance with the Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 and shall require consideration of how extensively the proposed activity will affect the following functional qualities of the wetland: 
1.  Sediment and pollution trapping and retention. 
2.  Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage. 
3.  Fish and wildlife habitat and endangered plants and animals. 
4.  Recreational use. 
5.  Shoreline or bank stabilization. 
6.  Historical significance. 
b.  The smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible; 
c.  Ground cover such as mulch is used for temporary bare soil coverage and permanent ground cover, such as sod, is established; 
d.  Methods to prevent erosion and trap sediment during construction are employed; 
e.  Altered areas are stabilized to accepted erosion control standards; 
f.  Fill is not placed so as to create unstable slopes; 
g.  Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes are certified by qualified professionals as to slope stability; 
h.  Alterations below the OHWL are authorized by the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources per Minn. Stats. § 103G.245; 
i.  Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the OHWL and the height of the riprap above the OHWL does not exceed three feet; and 
j.  Alterations of topography shall only be permitted if accessory to a permitted or special use. 
(6)  Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities are not permitted in shoreland areas. 
(7)  Riparian areas dedicated to the city shall be protected from intensive development. Permitted uses include passive open space, pedestrian trails, public parks and park-related structures, facilities for public water access, fishing piers, parking lots for park users, and stormwater treatment ponds. Unless being used for active park purposes, the riparian areas shall be maintained in permanent natural vegetation. 
(h)  Sand and gravel extraction. The following standards shall apply to sand and gravel extraction uses: 
(1)  Processing machinery shall be located consistent with setback standards for structures. 
(2)  A site development and restoration plan shall be developed by the owner for approval by the city which addresses dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation and anticipates vegetation and topography alterations. It shall identify actions to be taken to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and measures to be employed to restore the site after excavation. 
(i)  Stormwater management. Stormwater management shall be in accordance with division 3 of chapter 27. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Minnesota Stormwater Manual shall be used as guidance. 
(j)  Private utilities. The following provisions shall apply in shoreland areas:

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, adopted October 10, 2012, amended article IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article IV, §§ 24-201-24-215, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. Mins. of 6-27-2001; Ord. No. 1754, § 1754.03, 9-22-2004; No. 1803, § 1803.01, 5-14-2008; Ord. No. 1825, § 1825.14, 10-14-2009. 

Sec. 24-201. - Scope and general provisions. 
    This article applies to planned unit development conditional use permits. A planned unit development (PUD) is a tract of land developed as a unit under single or unified ownership or control and which generally includes two or more principal buildings or uses but may consist of one building containing a combination of principal and supportive uses. A PUD is intended to allow flexibility in the zoning process to encourage innovative land use and development. This article may allow modification to zoning and subdivision requirements such as lot size and dimensions, rights-of-way and street widths, housing types and building setbacks as well as allow private streets and driveways or zero lot line development. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-202. - Purpose. 
    The purposes of this article are: 
(a)  To encourage a more creative and efficient development of land and its improvements through the preservation of natural features and/or desirable site characteristics than possible under strict application of zoning and subdivision requirements. 
(b)  To meet the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan and adopted master plans of the city while preserving the health, safety, and welfare of its residents. 
(c)  To allow for the potential mixture of compatible uses in an integrated and well-planned area. 
(d)  To increase public open space or greenways and/or to ensure concentration of open space into more usable areas and preservation or restoration of natural resources. 
(e)  To facilitate the economical and efficient provision of streets and public utilities and to prevent development that would burden the existing tax base or in areas without adequate public improvements. 
(f)  To facilitate developments that provide a benefit to the city as a whole, through, but not limited to, higher standards of architectural and site design, enhanced or innovative public infrastructure, sustainable design, provision of life-cycle and/or affordable housing, redevelopment or expanded transportation options. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-203. - Effect on existing zoning; interpretation. 
    The granting of a PUD conditional use permit does not alter in any manner the existing zoning district classification except that building permits shall not be issued which are not in conformity pursuant to an approved PUD conditional use permit unless it is amended, cancelled or modified. Whenever a question arises concerning the interpretation of this article, it shall be the duty of the planning and zoning commission to ascertain all facts concerning the question and forward all data and a recommendation to the city council for a determination. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-204. - Permitted uses. 
    Uses not otherwise allowed in the zoning district are prohibited within a PUD unless specific provisions are made and listed in the PUD conditional use permit or conditions of approval. A PUD may include varied and compatible land uses within one defined development. Uses may include: 
(a)  Dwelling units in detached, clustered, semi-detached or attached multi-storied structures or combinations thereof. 
(b)  Commercial, office and industrial uses. 
(c)  Supporting community facilities and institutional uses. 
(d)  Parks, recreational facilities and open space. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-205. - Density. 
    In any PUD the maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall not exceed the base density identified in the land use districts in the comprehensive plan, except that: 
(a)  Density bonuses consistent with the comprehensive plan and any adopted city policies may be granted if the proposed project meets certain objectives of the city as identified in the comprehensive plan. These objectives include but are not limited to affordable housing or other identified housing needs, sustainability, increased open space or greenway development. 
(b)  Density transfers within the PUD may be allowed provided the project area is at least 40 acres; however, this area requirement may be reduced when the project provides for the dedication of needed public infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-206. - Pre-application meeting. 
    Prior to the submission of any plan to the planning and zoning commission, the applicant shall meet with the zoning administrator to discuss the contemplated project relative to community development objectives for the area in question and to learn the procedural steps and exhibits required. This includes the procedural steps for a conditional use permit and a preliminary plat. The applicant may submit a simple sketch plan at this stage for informal review and discussion. The applicant is urged to avail himself or herself of the advice and assistance of the city staff to facilitate the review. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-207. - Concept plan. 
    The concept PUD plan is optional and provides an opportunity for the applicant to submit a plan to the city generally illustrating the proposed development without incurring substantial cost. The process is also intended to allow the city and general public to identify potential issues and concerns at an early stage of project development. 
(a)  The property owner or his agent may meet with the zoning administrator to describe the situation, to be advised of the procedures and to obtain an application form. 
(b)  The following exhibits shall be required for a concept PUD application: 
(1)  Complete application form signed by all property owners. 
(2)  All required fees and escrows along with an executed escrow deposit agreement. 
(3)  Statement of all property owners of all land included within the proposal and a list of property owners' names and addresses within 500 feet of the outer boundaries of the property and two sets of mailing labels obtained from Washington County or a title or abstract company. 
(4)  Location map showing the site in relation to the surrounding area and important elements, including major roadways, public facilities and parks. 
(5)  Concept plan(s) or sketch(es) for the proposed project area. 
(6)  Written narrative addressing proposed uses, housing types, density, public or private amenities, parks and open space, phasing, timing as well as the experience and financial capacity of the proposed developers. The narrative should address how the city's values, as identified in the comprehensive plan, are incorporated into the design of the overall development. 
(c)  The zoning administrator shall forward the application and required exhibits to the planning and zoning commission for review and consideration. A notice of the planning and zoning commission meeting for consideration of the application shall be sent to all property owners within 500 feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question. 
(d)  The planning and zoning commission shall review the proposal and report to the city council its comments and suggestions with regard to the concept PUD plan. 
(e)  The zoning administrator shall schedule the public hearing and shall cause notice of the time, place and purpose of said hearing to be published at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing in the official newspaper of the city. The notice shall be mailed to the owners of the property within 500 feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question not less than ten days prior to the date of the hearing. 
(f)  The city council shall, after receipt and placing on file the report of the planning and zoning commission and zoning administrator, hold a public hearing on the application. The city council shall also review the concept PUD plan and provide feedback to the applicant. The council will not take any formal action to approve or deny the application. No comments, suggestions, remarks or observations made by city staff, the planning and zoning commission or the city council shall be binding on the city for future stages. 
(Ord. No. 1860, § 1860.01, 10-10-2012) 
Sec. 24-208. - PUD conditional use permit. 
(a)  Application procedure. An applicant shall make an application for a PUD conditional use permit following the procedural steps as set forth in article II, division 4, conditional use permits, of this chapter. 
(b)  Required exhibits. In addition to the requirements in section 24-41, the following exhibits and written narratives shall be submitted to the zoning administrator by the proposed developer as a part of the application for a PUD conditional use permit: 
(1)  Explanation of the character of the planned development and the manner in which it has been planned to take advantage of the PUD regulations, including a list of all deviations from the standard zoning regulations and an explanation as to why these deviations provide a public benefit. 
(2)  Explanation of how comments on the concept PUD plan have been incorporated into the design of the general development plan, if applicable. 
(3)  General indication of the expected schedule of development including progressive phasing and time schedule. 
(4)  Any additional information requested by the city staff, the planning and zoning commission and city council that may be required for clarification of the proposed project. 
(c)  Preliminary plat. Unless waived by the zoning administrator, the applicant shall also submit a preliminary plat and all the necessary documentation as required under chapter 21 of all or that portion of the project to be platted. For purposes of administrative simplification, the public hearings required for the PUD conditional use permit and preliminary plat and any potential rezoning of property may be combined into one hearing or may be held concurrently. 
(d)  Additional findings. In addition to the criteria and standards set forth in article II, division 4 of this chapter for the granting of conditional use permits, the following additional findings shall be made before the approval of the PUD conditional use permit: 
(1)  The proposed PUD is in conformance with any adopted master plan for the project area. 
(2)  The PUD is designed to form a desirable and unified environment within its own boundaries. 
(3)  The development plan provides for the creation, preservation or restoration of natural resources such as native vegetation, valuable habitat, lakes, streams, wetlands, shorelands, flood plains, woodlands, steep slopes and similar areas. 
(4)  The PUD is consistent with the planned and efficient provision of public improvements and would not burden the existing tax base by increasing development or in areas without adequate infrastructure or public facilities. 
(5)  The PUD can be planned and developed to harmonize with any existing or proposed development in the areas surrounding the project site. The uses proposed will not have an undue and adverse impact on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property and will not be detrimental to potential surrounding uses. 
(6)  The tract under consideration is under single ownership or control. 
(7)  Single-family detached units or clustering of housing units may be allowed as a PUD in areas providing urban services, or in the R-2 estate district, providing parks and open space are an integral part of the plan. 
(8)  Each phase of the development, as it is proposed to be completed, is of sufficient size, composition, and arrangement that its construction, marketing, and operation are feasible as a complete unit, and that provision and construction of dwelling units and common open space are balanced and coordinated. 
(9)  Common elements proposed as part of the PUD are appropriate for the scale, location, shape, size, density and topography of the development and must be suitably improved for the intended use(s) except that significant natural features may be preserved or restored.

DIVISION 1. - ARCHITECTURE AND LIGHTING 

Sec. 24-231. - Purpose. 
    The performance standards established in this article are designed to encourage a high standard of development by providing assurance that neighboring land uses will be compatible. The performance standards are designed to prevent and eliminate those conditions that cause blight or are detrimental to the environment. All future development in all districts shall be required to meet these standards and the standards shall also apply to existing development where so stated. 
(Ord. No. 1863, § 1863.01, 10-24-2012) 
Sec. 24-232. - Architecture, single-family dwellings. 
    The following standards shall apply to single-family dwellings in all districts: 
(a)  The minimum depth of the main portion of the structure shall be not less than 20 feet as measured across the narrowest portion. 
(b)  All dwellings shall be placed on a permanent foundation in compliance with the building code as adopted by the city. 
(c)  All single-family dwellings shall be placed so that the apparent entrance or front of the home faces or parallels the principal street frontage, except where the lot size exceeds one acre. 
(Ord. No. 1863, § 1863.01, 10-24-2012) 
Sec. 24-233. - Certain dwelling units prohibited. 
    No garage, tent, trailer, basement, recreational vehicle or accessory building shall be used as an independent dwelling. 
(Ord. No. 1863, § 1863.01, 10-24-2012) 
Sec. 24-234. - Architecture, multiple-family dwellings. 
(a)  All buildings within a multiple-family dwelling development shall be planned so that each exterior facade meets the same standards and requirements as for the front of the building unless otherwise approved by the city council. 
(b)  All multiple-family dwelling buildings shall be designed and constructed to have the equivalent of a front appearance on each exterior facade. Multiple-family buildings of three or more stories shall have at least 65 percent or more of brick or other approved class I material. The brick or Class I material must be distributed throughout the exterior to provide an architecturally balanced appearance. 
(Ord. No. 1863, § 1863.01, 10-24-2012) 
Sec. 24-235. - Architecture, nonresidential buildings. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards for exterior architecture of commercial, office, industrial, institutional and warehouse buildings and to ensure a high quality of development, redevelopment and compatibility with evolving architectural or planning themes that contribute to a community image of quality, visual aesthetics, permanence and stability which are in the best interest of the citizens of the city. These standards are intended to prevent use of materials that are unsightly, deteriorate rapidly, contribute to depreciation of area property values, or cause urban blight. 
These standards are further intended to ensure coordinated design of building exteriors, additions and accessory structure exteriors in order to prevent visual disharmony, minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties from buildings which are or may become unsightly, and buildings that detract from the character and appearance of the area. It is not the intent of this division to unduly restrict design freedom when reviewing and approving project architecture in relationship to the proposed land use, site characteristics and interior building layout. However, modifications to the exterior design may be required to promote compatibility with the desired architecture in the immediate vicinity and/or the general architectural character of the area and the city in general. 
(1)  General design concept. Building and/or project designs may be required to modify building materials, colors, details, site plan, landscape plantings, or other features to meet the intent of these architectural standards. 
(2)  Modifications. Projects may be required to utilize building ornamentation features, including but not limited to: columns, arches, parapets, cornices, friezes, canopies, moldings, dentils, corbels, quoins, rustication, vaults, domes, and cupolas. 
(3)  Corporate identity. The intent and purpose of the architectural standards supersede corporate identity designs. When a corporate identity design does not meet the intent and purpose of the architectural standards, the corporate identity design shall be limited to the area immediately adjacent to the main entry and may require modification to meet the intent of the ordinance. 
(b)  Applicability and review. This section shall apply to all commercial, office, institutional and industrial buildings, additions, exterior remodeling and accessory structures, unless different exterior materials are specifically approved. The review and approval process shall be the same as outlined in section 24-123 of the City Code. 
(c)  Submission requirements. The applicant shall submit the following minimum information to demonstrate conformance with exterior design standards in section 24-235. 
(1)  Elevations and dimensions of all sides of existing and proposed buildings, including roof mechanical equipment, vents, chimneys, or other projecting items above the roof line. 
(2)  Elevations and dimensions of all existing or proposed solid waste and recycling containment areas. 
(3)  Detailed exterior descriptions, including type and color of all exterior building materials, awnings, exterior lighting, mechanical screening material, fencing, metal flashing and the like. 
(4)  To aid in evaluating the exterior design, the applicant shall submit schematic floor plans showing, if applicable, window locations, doors, loading docks, projected interior layouts, seating, bar areas, waiting areas, vestibules, patios and outdoor seating, storage areas, food preparation areas, interior trash or recycling space and the like. 
(5)  Heating, air conditioning and ventilating and electrical equipment heights, locations and screening materials. 
(6)  Colored renderings, exterior building and finish material samples and color pallets. 
(7)  Sightline diagrams are required. Rooftop units must be hidden from view from all locations. 
(8)  Other information as required. 
(d)  Exterior design standards. Building exteriors shall be subject to the following standards: 
(1)  Classes of materials. For the purpose of this subsection, materials shall be divided into class I, class II, class III and class IV categories as follows:

b.  Industrial and warehouse buildings must use at least two different class I or II materials and be composed of at least 65 percent class I or class II; not more than 35 percent of class III or class IV materials. Not more than ten percent of the building shall be class IV materials. 
c.  Any nonresidential structure adjacent to an interstate highway, or any multi-tenant office/warehouse or showroom/warehouse or other combinations shall be 65 percent class I materials on primary exteriors. Exterior walls with limited public exposure may use combinations of class II, III or IV materials unless otherwise approved by the city council. 
d.  Buildings in nonresidential zoning districts that are not office, commercial, industrial or warehouse uses shall conform to the exterior finish materials and proportions of office or commercial buildings unless otherwise approved by the city council as meeting the purpose of this division. 
e.  The use of class II, III or IV materials shall be distributed throughout the exterior of a building unless the city agrees that materials consolidated on more visible locations provides the most positive architectural appeal to the general public. 
f.  Expansions of less than 50 percent of the floor area of the existing building may use the same or superior materials as the existing structure. 
g.  A distinctively different color of brick may be considered as a second class I material. However, minor blended color variations shall not be considered as a separate material. 
h.  To be counted as a primary material, the product must comprise at least five percent of the exterior wall. 
(3)  Buildings may be constructed primarily of one specific class I material provided the design is obviously superior to the general intent of this division, provides variation in detailing, footprint of the structure or deviations in long wall sections to provide visual interest. 
(4)  Garage doors, window trim, flashing accent items and the like, shall not constitute required materials that make up the exterior of a building. 
(5)  As viewed from ground levels from all locations, all mechanical equipment located on the roof or around the perimeter of a structure shall be hidden by a raised parapet or with materials comparable and compatible with exterior building materials. 
a.  A raised parapet or other architectural feature that is an integral part(s) of the building may be required as screening for rooftop mechanical equipment or to soften rooftop views. If shown that rooftop units will be visible, an increased parapet height or additional screening shall be required so that the rooftop equipment is hidden from view. 
b.  The back of parapets that are visible must be finished with materials and colors compatible with the front of the parapet. 
c.  Screening for rooftop mechanical equipment shall incorporate similar architectural features of the building and/or be constructed of a material and color compatible with other elements of the building.

(7)  Garish or bright accent colors (i.e. orange, bright yellow or fluorescent colors) for such buildings such as cloth or metal awnings, trim, banding, walls, entries or any portion of the building shall be minimized, but in no case shall such coloring exceed five percent of each wall area. 
(8)  Brick or stone exteriors shall not be painted during the life of the exterior materials. 
(9)  Equipment used for mechanical, processing, bulk storage tanks, or equipment used for suppressing noise, odors and the like that protrudes from a side of a building or is located on the ground adjacent to a building shall be hidden from public view with materials and designs matching those used for the structure. Where miscellaneous exterior equipment cannot be fully hidden with matching building materials, landscaping may be used as additional screening. 
(e)  Fences shall be regulated by chapter 6, article IV. 
(Ord. No. 1863, § 1863.01, 10-24-2012) 
Sec. 24-236. - Lighting. 
(a)  Purpose. The regulation of exterior lighting is necessary to prevent misdirected or excessive artificial light, caused by inappropriate or misaligned light fixtures that produce glare, light trespass (nuisance light), and/or unnecessary sky glow; such regulation is necessary to discourage the waste of electricity and to improve or maintain nighttime public safety, utility, and security. 
(b)  Nonresidential and licensed multiple family dwelling. The owner of any nonresidential property or a licensed multiple family dwelling shall be responsible for providing and maintaining effective illumination in all exterior parking lots, vehicular access, yard areas, entrances and walkways. All exterior lighting shall be directed away from any adjoining residential property and from public streets. The source of lights shall be hooded or controlled in a manner so as not to light adjacent properties. Lighting fixture lamps and globes shall be opaque to eliminate glare. Parking lot lighting shall be sodium vapor, shoebox style, downward facing, flush lens and mounted at a maximum height of 25 feet as measured from grade level unless otherwise approved as part of the final site and building plan review process or by the zoning administrator. Parking lots shall be illuminated to a minimum of one and a maximum of four at pavement level. Illumination cast from any light or combination of lights shall not exceed one-foot candle (meter reading) as measured from the centerline of a public street or residential property line. 
(c)  Single-family residential. Lighting shall be considered a nuisance when an artificial light source has not been properly directed. Any light or combination of lights shall direct light downward to reduce direct glare onto adjacent properties. Lighting shall be considered properly directed if it is directed downward 60 degrees from the horizontal. Halogen lights must be 100 percent shielded as viewed from the property line. Exceptions: 
(1)  Standard residential lighting fixtures typically mounted at doors using low wattage incandescent bulbs, not to exceed 60 watts or comparable.

Sec. 25-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in M.S. Ch. 103F and Ch. 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Woodbury, Minnesota does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1829.02, 1-27-2010) 
Sec. 25-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Woodbury, Minnesota, are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures on flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. 
(c)  This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the City of Woodbury's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1829.02, 1-27-2010) 
Sec. 25-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 25-2(a) by provisions contained herein.

    Regional flood A flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. Also referred to as the "100-year flood" or the "1% annual chance flood." 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
    Structure. Anything manufactured, constructed, or erected which is normally attached to or positioned on land, including portable structures. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(2)  Any alteration of an "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure." For the purpose of this chapter, "historic structure" shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1. 
    Variance means a modification of a specific development standard required in an official control including this chapter and chapter 24 of City Code to allow an alternative development standard. The alternative development standard only applies to the particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in planning and zoning enabling legislation.

The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
(b)  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be floodproofed in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation. 
(2)  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code and, for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. Floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards: 
i.  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; 
ii.  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and 
iii.  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(c)  This section reserved for future use. 
(d)  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(e)  The provisions of section 25-23 of this chapter shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1829.02, 1-27-2010) 
Sec. 25-21. - Conditional uses. 
    Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with section 25-20(a) and (b) and or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in section 25-20(d) shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in sections 25-22 and 25-23 and 25-38 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1829.02, 1-27-2010) 
Sec. 25-22. - Standards for flood fringe conditional uses. 
(a)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
(1)  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding 
(2)  Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
i.  A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and 
ii.  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
(b)  Basements, as defined by section 25-11(c) of this chapter, shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with section 25-22(c) of this chapter. 
(c)  All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
(d)  This section reserved for future use. 
(e)  Storage of materials and equipment. 
(1)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(2)  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the City of Woodbury. 
(f)  The provisions of section 25-23 of this chapter shall also apply. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1829.02, 1-27-2010) 
Sec. 25-23. - Standards for all flood fringe uses. 
(a)  This section reserved for future use. 
(b)  Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
(c)  Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in section 25-23(b) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
(d)  Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
(e)  Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
(f)  Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in section 25-34. 
(g)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

Sec. 25-40. - Violations/failure to comply. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1829.02, 1-27-2010) 
Sec. 25-41. - Penalties. 
    Nothing contained herein shall prevent the City of Woodbury from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions may include but are not limited to: 
(a)  In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the City of Woodbury may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. 
(b)  When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the community development director, the community development director shall reasonably investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably practical, this information will be submitted to the appropriate department of natural resources' and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with a plan of action to address the violation to the degree possible. 
(c)  The community development director shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the community development director may order the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted. If the construction or development is already completed, then the community development director may either: 
(1)  Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls; or 
(2)  Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days. 
(d)  If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the community development director within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and may be prosecuted accordingly. The community development director may also upon the lapse of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 1657, § 1657.02, 3-26-97) 
ARTICLE III. - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES 

Sec. 26-10. - [Application.] 
    Section 26-11 through section 26-14 shall govern administrative citations and civil penalties for violations of the City Code. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1657.02, 3-26-97) 
Sec. 26-11. - [Alternative enforcement methods.] 
    The city council finds that there is a need for alternate methods of enforcing the City Code. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled as criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative violations. The criminal process does not always regard City Code violations as being important. Accordingly, the city council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of enforcement shall be in addition to any other legal remedy which may be pursued for City Code violations. 
    The administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this chapter are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective, and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of certain ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with the administrative offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as is provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance with law. Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first or succeeding instances. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1657.02, 3-26-97) 
Sec. 26-12. - General provisions. 
(1)  A violation of any provision of the City Code or the acts prohibited in section 26-1 is an administrative offense which may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties pursuant to this chapter. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. 
(2)  Any officer of the Woodbury Police Department or any other person employed by the city, authorized in writing by the city administrator shall, upon determining that there has been a violation, notify the violator, or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation. Said notice shall set forth the nature, date and time of violation, the name of the official issuing the notice, and the amount of the scheduled penalty. 
(3)  Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule of penalties for the violation as adopted by the city council resolution from time to time, or may request a hearing in writing, as is provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation. 
(4)  Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this chapter may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, request a hearing by a hearing officer who shall forthwith conduct an informal hearing to determine if a violation has occurred. The hearing officer shall have authority to dismiss the violation or reduce or waive the penalty. If the violation is sustained by the hearing officer, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed within seven days or withdraw from participation in the administrative procedure by notice in writing. 
(5)  A person designated in writing by the city administrator shall be the hearing officer. The hearing officer is authorized to hear and determine any controversy relating to administrative offenses provided for in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1657.02, 3-26-97) 
Sec. 26-13. - Recovery of civil penalties. 
(1)  If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it shall constitute: 
a.  A lien upon the real property upon which the violation occurred if the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the violation and the property owner was found responsible for that violation; or 
b.  A personal obligation of the violator in all other situations. 
(2)  A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the same manner as taxes. 
(3)  A personal obligation may be collected by any appropriate legal means. 
(4)  A late payment fee to ten percent of the fine shall be assessed for each 30-day period, or part thereof, that the fine remains unpaid after the due date. 
(5)  Failure to pay a fine is grounds for suspending or revoking a license or permit or other approval associated with the violation. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1657.02, 3-26-97) 
Sec. 26-14. - Criminal penalties. 
    The following are misdemeanors, punishable in accordance with state law. 
(1)  Failure to pay a fine or request a hearing within seven days after issuance of an administrative citation. 
(2)  Failure to appear at a hearing which was scheduled. 
(3)  Failure to pay a fine imposed by a hearing officer within seven days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the hearing officer.

Sec. 27-13. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to set forth the minimum standards for preservation, protection and maintenance of wetlands in the city. These standards are designed to protect and preserve natural resources, promote water quality, reduce human disturbance and provide wildlife habitat. 
( Ord. No. 1899, § 1, 4-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 27-14. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this division shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and to give this division its most reasonable application. For the purpose of this division, the words "must" and "shall" are mandatory and not permissive. 
    Buffer is land that is used to protect adjacent lands and waters from development and intensive land uses. The land is kept in a natural state of trees, shrubs, low ground cover and understory plants and functions to filter runoff, control sediment and nutrient movement, and protect wildlife habitat. 
    BMPs (best management practices) are erosion and sediment control and water quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing degradation of surface water. BMPs include stationary, permanent practices that are designed, constructed and operated to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants, schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to stormwater, surface waters, or stormwater conveyance systems. BMPs also include treatment practices, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. 
    City is the City of Woodbury. 
    Construction is disturbance to the land that results in a change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and non-vegetative), or the existing soil topography that may result in accelerated stormwater runoff, leading to soil erosion and movement of sediment into surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of construction activity may include clearing, grading, filling, and excavating. 
    Grading is any excavating or filling or combination thereof. 
    LGU is the local government unit. 
    New development is all construction activity that is not defined as redevelopment. 
    Noxious weeds are annual, biennial, or perennial plants that the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture designates to be injurious to public health, the environment, public roads, crops, livestock, or other property. 
    Redevelopment is any construction activity that exposes native soils, adds additional impervious surface to an existing developed site and/or removes and replaces a building/structure. Aesthetic projects and maintenance activities are not defined as redevelopment for the purposes of this division. 
    Slope is an inclined ground surface, the inclination of which is expressed as a ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance. 
    Wetlands (as defined in Minnesota Rules 7050.0186) are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Constructed wetlands designed for wastewater treatment are not waters of the state. Wetlands must have the following attributes: 
(1)  A predominance of hydric soils; 
(2)  Inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in a saturated soil condition; and 
(3)  Under normal circumstances support a prevalence of such vegetation. 
( Ord. No. 1899, § 1, 4-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 27-15. - Protection of wetlands. 
(a)  The city is within the boundaries of three watershed districts. The watershed districts serve as the LGUs for the Wetland Conservation Act and have wetland rules and management plans that specify buffer widths and standards for individual wetlands. This section incorporates by reference the most recent wetland rules and management plans of the watershed districts. The city also requires subparagraphs (b)-(f) be implemented for all wetlands where the requirement below is more restrictive than the applicable watershed district rules. 
(b)  Wetland delineations shall be completed for all wetlands on a project site. Delineations will be completed as required by the appropriate watershed district. 
(c)  Wetlands will be placed on outlots dedicated to the city during platting. If, at the city's sole discretion, an easement dedicated to the city is deemed sufficient to protect the wetland and preferable to an outlot, an easement will be granted to the city. 
The dedicated outlot or easement will include the wetland buffer area or the land one foot in elevation above the wetland's modeled Atlas 14, Volume 8 (or subsequent updates) 100-year high water elevation, whichever is greater. Access easements to the wetland will also be provided as required by the city. If a wetland is located in an easement, the limits of the easement must be identified by permanent markers such that each adjoining property owner may be reasonably aware of the existence of the easement and the restrictions associated with it. 
(d)  Wetland buffers described in this section shall be required for any parcel where construction, new development or redevelopment activity occurs. 
(1)  Buffer widths will be determined as described below: 
a.  The buffer width will be determined by the applicable watershed district through the district's most recent wetland management document. 
b.  All wetlands will have a 25-foot minimum undisturbed buffer from the delineated wetland boundary. This undisturbed buffer will be established and maintained following the criteria below: 
1.  The buffer will be measured from the approved delineated wetland boundary. 
2.  No buffer area averaging is allowed within the minimum buffer. 
3.  Activities including, but not limited to, grading, paving, or filling are prohibited within the minimum buffer. 
4.  The minimum buffer shall be undisturbed at all times. 
5.  The buffer shall be maintained in unmowed vegetation with the exception of buffer vegetation management described in subsection (4) below. 
6.  Trails, regardless of surface material, are prohibited within the minimum buffer. Existing trails and replacement of trails that are currently within the 25-foot minimum buffer are exempt from this prohibition. 
7.  Constructed stormwater management BMPs are prohibited within the minimum buffer. 
8.  Wetland mitigation, as approved by the applicable watershed district, is an allowable disturbance. The 25-foot undisturbed buffer will apply to the newly created wetland. 
(2)  Wetland buffers shall be required for any proposed development project if adjacent to a wetland, whether or not the wetland is located on the same parcel as the proposed development. 
(3)  Activities, including, but not limited to, building, dumping, yard waste disposal or fertilizer application are prohibited within all buffers, including watershed district buffers. Mowing, cutting and application of pesticides are also prohibited unless done as part of an approved vegetation management plan. 
(4)  Buffer vegetation. 
a.  Where acceptable vegetation, as determined by the city and/or applicable watershed district, exists in buffer areas, the vegetation may be retained in an undisturbed state without additional vegetation planting. A buffer has acceptable vegetation if it: 
1.  Has a continuous, dense layer of vegetation or overstory of trees and/or shrubs that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least five consecutive years, and 
2.  Is not composed of undesirable plant species as determined by the city (including, but not limited to, common buckthorn, purple loosestrife, leafy spurge, and other noxious weeds). 
b.  If acceptable vegetation does not exist, the buffer areas must be planted in appropriate native vegetation including grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees. After becoming established, the vegetation in wetland buffer areas must be left undisturbed. 
c.  The requirement to leave the buffer area undisturbed does not prohibit the removal of dead, diseased, or dying vegetation, or the control of noxious weeds or other invasive non-native plants. 
(e)  Grading and building constraints near buffers. 
(1)  Grading adjacent to wetlands shall be done so that there is no more than a three to one (3:1) slope down to the wetland buffer. 
(2)  Grading around buildings adjacent to wetland buffers shall meet the following criteria as applicable: 
a.  A 15-foot usable flat area around the sides of the buildings; 
b.  A 25-foot usable flat area from the rear of the buildings. 
(3)  Grading for parking lots, streets, and driveways adjacent to wetland areas shall have a ten-foot flat area adjacent to the edge of the parking lot, street, or driveway. 
(4)  In no case shall a building be closer than 25 feet to the wetland buffer. 
(f)  All requirements of this division apply to wetland mitigation areas in addition to natural wetlands. 
(g)  If a landowner or a project proposer believes an alternative development plan is available that does not meet the above requirements, but would have beneficial environmental aspects that outweigh the impacts to the wetland and/or buffer, they may submit such a plan to the city and watershed district for consideration. The plan should clearly identify the environmental benefits obtained by the alternative development proposal.

DIVISION 3. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1899, § 1, adopted April 8, 2015 , repealed the former Div. 3, §§ 27-25-27-29, and enacted a new Div. 3 as set out herein. The former Div. 3 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Sec. 27-25. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to set forth the minimum requirements for stormwater management that minimize threats to public health, safety, public and private property and natural resources of the community and meet the requirements of applicable regulatory agencies by establishing standards including: 
(1)  Site design standards that encourage the minimization of stormwater runoff and maximization of pervious areas for stormwater treatment and infiltration. 
(2)  Volume management standards that reduce loading of total phosphorus, total suspended solids, and stormwater runoff volume to the city's lakes, wetlands, and streams; and that promote groundwater recharge and protect drinking water and wells. 
(3)  Standards that reduce or maintain predevelopment flows to the city's lakes, wetlands and streams; that control flooding and maintain the natural communities associated with these surface water resources; and that protect life and property from the dangers associated with flooding. 
(4)  Protect the stormwater system from pollution caused by illicit discharges and/or connections. 
( Ord. No. 1899, § 1, 4-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 27-26. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this division shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and to give this division its most reasonable application. For the purpose of this division, the words "must" and "shall" are mandatory and not permissive. 
    Active karst are geographic areas underlain by carbonate bedrock (or other forms of bedrock that can erode or dissolve) with less than 50 feet of sediment cover. 
    BMPs (best management practices) are water quality and erosion and sediment control management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing degradation of surface water. BMPs include stationary, permanent practices that are designed, constructed and operated to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants, schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to stormwater, surface waters, or stormwater conveyance systems. BMPs also include treatment practices, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. 
    City is the City of Woodbury. 
    Construction is disturbance to the land that results in a change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and non-vegetative), or the existing soil topography that may result in accelerated stormwater runoff, leading to soil erosion and movement of sediment into surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of construction activity may include clearing, grading, filling, and excavating. 
    Emergency management zone (EMZ) is the area within a 1,000-foot radius from any municipal well. 
    Green infrastructure is a wide array of practices at multiple scales that manage wet weather and that maintains or restores natural hydrology by infiltrating, evapotranspiring, or harvesting and using stormwater. On a regional scale, green infrastructure is the preservation or restoration of natural landscape features, coupled with policies such as infill and redevelopment that reduce overall imperviousness in a watershed. On the local scale, green infrastructure consists of site and neighborhood-specific practices. 
    Groundwater is water contained below the surface of the earth in the saturated zone including, without limitation, all waters whether under confined, unconfined, or perched conditions, in near surface unconsolidated sediment or regolith, or in rock formations deeper underground. 
    Hazardous materials are any materials which because of quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics may cause, or significantly contribute to, a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, safety, property, or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed. 
    Illicit connection is any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, which allows an illegal discharge to enter the storm drain system including any non-stormwater discharge including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection had been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by an authorized enforcement agency. 
    Illicit discharge is any direct or indirect non-stormwater discharge to the storm sewer system, except as exempted in section 27-28, stormwater and urban runoff control. 
    Impervious surface is a constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads. 
    Infiltration is the passage or movement of water into the soil. 
    Linear redevelopment projects are roadways, sidewalks, and trails that are not part of another development that create 6,000 square feet or more of new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces or disturb one acre or more of area. Fully reconstructed means areas where impervious surfaces have been removed down to the underlying soils. Activities such as mill and overlay projects and pavement rehabilitation projects that do not alter underlying soil material beneath the structure, pavement, or activity are not considered fully reconstructed impervious surfaces. In addition, other maintenance activities such as catch basin and pipe replacements shall not be considered fully reconstructed impervious surfaces. 
    MPCA is the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. 
    New development is all construction activity that is not defined as redevelopment. 
    Open space means open areas, including parks, natural areas, playgrounds, and trails. 
    Pollutant is any substance which, when discharged has potential to or does: 
(1)  Interfere with state designated water uses; 
(2)  Obstruct or cause damage to surface waters; 
(3)  Change water color, odor or usability as a drinking water source through causes not attributable to natural processes affecting surface water or subsurface processes affecting groundwater; 
(4)  Add an unnatural surface film on the water; 
(5)  Adversely change other chemical, biological, thermal or physical conditions in any surface water; 
(6)  Degrade the quality of groundwater; or 
(7)  Harm human life, aquatic life or terrestrial plant and wildlife. 
    Pollutants may include dredged soil, solid waste, garbage, wastewater, chemical waste, biological materials including yard waste and animal waste, rock, sand, dust, industrial waste, sediment, nutrients, toxic substances, pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer, trace metal, automotive fluid, petroleum-based substances, oxygen-demanding material, fecal coliform and pathogens, wastes and residues that result from constructing a building or structure and noxious or offensive matter of any kind. 
    Predevelopment means the land use that was predominant over the ten-year period preceding a development application, based on review of available aerial photos. 
    Private stormwater facilities are any stormwater and drainage works not under the control or ownership of the city, county, state and/or federal government which may include, but are not limited to, inlets, conduits, pipes, pumping stations, manholes, structures, channels, outlets, retention or detention basins, infiltration areas, other structural components and equipment designed to transport, move or regulate stormwater. 
    Redevelopment is any construction activity that exposes native soils, adds additional impervious surface to an existing developed site and/or removes and replaces a building/structure. Aesthetic projects and maintenance activities are not defined as redevelopment for the purposes of this division. 
    Seasonally saturated soil is the highest seasonal elevation in the soil that is in a reduced chemical state because of soil voids being filled with water. Saturated soil is evidenced by the presence of redoximorphic features or other information. 
    Sewage is any water-carried domestic waste, exclusive of footing and roof drainage of any residence, industry, agriculture or commercial establishment whether treated or untreated and includes the liquid wastes produced by bathing, laundry and culinary operations; and from toilets and floor drains. 
    Storm sewer system is a conveyance or system of conveyances that is owned and operated by the city or other entity and designed or used for collecting or conveying stormwater. 
    Stormwater as defined under Minnesota Rule 7090.0080 means stormwater runoff, snow melt runoff, and surface runoff and drainage. 
    Surface water or waters are all streams, lakes, ponds, marshes, wetlands, reservoirs, springs, rivers, drainage systems, waterways, watercourses, irrigation systems or stormwater BMPs whether natural or artificial, public or private. 
    Wastewater is defined as liquid wastes, usually water that has been used, as for washing, flushing, or in a manufacturing process, and so contains waste products, collected in a sewer system and conveyed to a treatment plant for processing. 
    Wetlands (as defined in Minnesota Rules 7050.0186) are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Constructed wetlands designed for wastewater treatment are not waters of the state. Wetlands must have the following attributes: 
(1)  A predominance of hydric soils; 
(2)  Inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in a saturated soil condition; and 
(3)  Under normal circumstances support a prevalence of such vegetation.

Sec. 27-27. - Stormwater management standards and design criteria. 
(a)  Applicability. No person shall develop or redevelop land for residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses without having provided stormwater management measures that control or manage runoff from such developments unless specifically exempted below. 
The city is within the boundaries of three watershed districts. Project proposers shall be responsible for meeting the stormwater management rules of the underlying watershed district in addition to the requirements below. 
Submittal of stormwater management information as required in chapter 21, subdivisions, and chapter 24, zoning, must include information that exhibits compliance with this division and the city's most current Stormwater Guide, as applicable. 
(b)  Green infrastructure. Green infrastructure techniques and practices shall be the preferred BMPs for accomplishing compliance with this division. The following green infrastructure design options should be considered for use, consistent with zoning, subdivision, and PUD requirements: 
(1)  Preserving natural vegetation. 
(2)  Preserving and utilizing natural upland swales, depressions and upland storage areas in the post-development condition to the degree that they can convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge. Preservation requires that no grading or other construction activity occurs in these areas. 
(3)  Eliminating barrier curb and gutter where practicable and using vegetated swales or equivalent. 
(4)  Minimizing impervious surface. 
(5)  Minimizing parking facility size. 
(6)  Installing permeable pavement. 
(7)  Maximizing open space while incorporating smaller lot sizes to conserve natural areas and reduce the amount of stormwater runoff generated at the site. 
(8)  Utilizing vegetated areas to filter sheet flow, remove sediment and other pollutants and increase time of concentration. 
(9)  Disconnecting impervious areas by allowing runoff from small impervious areas to be directed to pervious areas where it can be infiltrated or filtered. 
(10)  Increasing buffers around streams, steep slopes, and wetlands to protect from flood damage and provide additional water quality treatment. 
(11)  Installing green roofs. 
(12)  Using irrigation ponds/systems, cisterns and related BMPs to reuse stormwater runoff. 
(13)  Planting of trees as a stormwater BMP. 
(14)  Utilizing a soil amendment/decompaction process after site disturbance. 
(c)  Natural features. All new development and redevelopment shall minimize impact to significant natural features. All sites shall be reviewed for the presence of wetlands, wooded areas of significance, rare and endangered species habitat, and preservation areas designated by the County Biological Survey, Metro Greenways, or parks and open space plans. The new development or redevelopment shall be designed to avoid these areas to the extent practicable. 
(d)  Volume management. Volume management for new development shall meet the following: 
(1)  The required volume reduction is the first 1.1 inches of runoff over the development site's impervious surface. 
(2)  Pretreatment in the form of ponds, forebays, filter strips or other approved methods shall be provided for all infiltration areas and be compliant with the city's most current Stormwater Guide. 
(3)  Calculations, modeling and design for and installation of volume control BMPs shall be compliant with the city's most current Stormwater Guide. 
(4)  No areas of constructed wet ponds or wetlands shall be accepted as an infiltration practice. 
(5)  The use of infiltration is prohibited in areas where the BMP will receive discharges from, or be constructed in, any of the following areas: 
a.  Where industrial facilities are not authorized to infiltrate industrial stormwater under an NPDES/SDS industrial stormwater permit issued by the MPCA. 
b.  Where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur. 
c.  Where there is less than three vertical feet of separation from the bottom of the infiltration BMP to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or the top of bedrock. 
d.  Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater will be mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater. 
e.  Within the emergency management zone (EMZ) of any city well. 
(6)  The use of infiltration BMPs shall be restricted and subject to additional city review where the volume control BMP will be constructed in any of the following areas: 
a.  Where predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay) soils exist. 
b.  Within 1,000 feet up-gradient, or 100 feet down-gradient of active karst features. The city may require the project proposer to perform additional geotechnical investigations in areas of suspected active karst or shallow bedrock. 
c.  Where there is less than ten vertical feet of separation from the bottom of the infiltration BMP to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or the top of bedrock where the infiltration BMP has a drainage area greater than two acres. 
d.  Where the bottom of the infiltration basin will be less than three feet above the normal water level of any adjacent wetland. 
e.  Within a drinking water supply management area (DWSMA) as defined in Minn. R. 4720.5100, subp. 13. 
f.  Where soil infiltration rates exceed 8.3 inches per hour. 
The additional review will be required to ensure that infiltration BMPs will perform properly and that groundwater is adequately protected. 
(7)  Where the site factors in subsection (5) or (6) limit the construction of infiltration BMPs, the project proposer must provide appropriate documentation to the city regarding the limitations. If the city determines that infiltration is prohibited or restricted on-site, the project proposer shall follow the flexible treatment options and/or mitigation options in the design sequence flowchart found in the city's most current Stormwater Guide. 
(e)  Phosphorus control. Generally, development sites that meet the volume management requirement will be exempt from additional phosphorus control. The underlying watershed district may have a phosphorus loading requirement for a downstream waterbody that may require additional treatment beyond the volume control requirement found in this division. 
(f)  Sediment control. Stormwater must be treated to remove 90 percent of the post-development total suspended solids load on an annual basis before discharge to natural surface waters. Sediment controls to protect volume management BMPs will be required. 
(g)  Oil and grease control. For developments where the potential for pollution by oil and/or grease exists as determined by the city, oil and grease removal technology may be required. 
(h)  Runoff rate control. New development must meet rate control requirements. All runoff calculations shall use Atlas 14, Volume 8 (or subsequent updates) rainfall events applicable to the city and follow methodology described in the city's most current Stormwater Guide. At a minimum, rate control shall be designed to accomplish the following: 
(1)  Maintain or reduce predevelopment peak runoff rates for the two-year, ten-year, and 100-year 24-hour storm events as shown in the city's surface water management plan. 
(2)  Stormwater management on new development, redevelopment and infrastructure projects shall be reviewed for adverse upstream or downstream impacts. This review may preclude a site from being developed or from discharging offsite. 
(i)  Flood protection.

Certain site-specific conditions may require a larger separation between the lowest ground elevation adjacent to a structure and the calculated high water level. The lowest ground elevation adjacent to structures shall be certified by the builder to ensure adequate freeboard. 
(5)  Overland emergency overflows shall be designed so a minimum of 1.5 feet of separation from the emergency overflow to the lowest ground elevation adjacent to the structure is provided. The city may require more separation dependent on size and capacity of the emergency overflow. The emergency overflow sizing matrix provided in the city's most current Stormwater Guide shall be used for design. When an adequately sized overland emergency overflow cannot be provided, the basin is considered landlocked. 
(6)  If the basin does not have an overland emergency overflow (landlocked), the lowest ground elevation adjacent to a structure shall be five feet above the calculated 100-year 24-hour high water level. 
(7)  The regional ponding and discharge limits detailed in the city's surface water management plan must be met on a subwatershed basis. If the site does not have on-site ponding for flood control purposes, off-site management and associated fees may be established provided that the following conditions for the off-site facility are met: 
a.  The downstream regional ponding site is in place or the city is actively working to construct it. 
b.  The facility is adequately designed to provide a level of stormwater control that meets the ordinance standards.

d.  The city receives compensation necessary to construct, operate and maintain the off-site stormwater facility. 
(j)  Redevelopment. Redevelopment projects shall be required to meet current standards as detailed in subsections (d)-(g) above for the disturbed portion of the site. Runoff rate control as described in (h) and flood control as described in (i) shall be required by the city if not currently provided for on-site or downstream to meet current requirements and/or downstream flooding issues exist. If strict compliance with the stormwater requirements is not possible on-site, the project proposer must provide appropriate documentation utilizing the design sequence flowchart found in the city's most current Stormwater Guide. If the city determines that on-site treatment is not feasible, the project proposer shall utilize the flexible treatment options and/or mitigation options to the extent practicable following the design sequence flowchart. 
(1)  During redevelopment, the total area that meets the redevelopment definition is the area that must meet current stormwater treatment standards. 
(2)  Flexibility will be allowed on-site as to the placement of the stormwater BMPs as long as an equivalent impervious area is being treated. 
(3)  If the city determines that a significant water quality or quantity benefit could be reasonably accomplished in excess of requirements for the property, the city may request additional treatment on-site at the expense of the city. 
(k)  Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from meeting volume management standards in (d) above: 
(1)  New development that results in a residential plat of three or less lots. 
(2)  New development or redevelopment of a single family detached home on one platted lot of record.

(1)  Ponds shall be constructed in a manner that does not require a dam safety permit issued by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources unless no feasible alternative exists, as determined by the city. All dams will be constructed as directed by the city. 
(2)  Where ponding is proposed in areas of shallow bedrock or suspected active karst, the pond design shall include measures to reduce the potential for groundwater contamination. These measures shall include, but are not limited to, a clay liner, a maximum ponding depth of six feet and a minimum separation between pond bottom and bedrock of ten feet. 
(n)  Other design requirements. 
(1)  Newly installed and rehabilitated catch basins shall be installed with a sump for the collection of coarse-grained material in areas determined appropriate by the city. 
(2)  All storm sewer system analyses and designs shall be based on proposed full development land use patterns. 
(3)  Any BMP that receives public stormwater shall be placed on an outlot and dedicated to the city at the time of development. The outlot size shall, at minimum, include the BMP to the 100-year high water level and the land one foot in elevation above the 100-year high water level. If, at the city's sole discretion, an easement dedicated to the city is deemed sufficient to protect and maintain the BMP and preferable to an outlot, an easement will be granted to the city and encompass the same area as the outlot described above. 
(4)  Design guidelines in the city's most current Stormwater Guide shall be implemented as applicable. 
(o)  Private BMPs. All private BMPs approved by the city shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  A permanent public easement shall be provided to the city for inspection and/or maintenance purposes as specified by the city.

(4)  All BMPs shall be maintained in proper condition consistent with the performance standards for which they were originally designed. 
(5)  If site configuration or structural BMPs change causing decreased BMP effectiveness, new or improved structural BMPs must be implemented to meet the requirements of this division. Removal or lack of vegetation that the city deems critical to the function and effectiveness of the BMP is included here as a change to the BMP. 
(6)  All structural BMPs shall be inspected annually. Settled materials, including settled solids, shall be removed and properly disposed of as necessary, based on inspection results. 
(7)  The city will request and review inspection and maintenance records and shall have the right to perform an inspection of BMPs at any time if the city has probable cause to believe that the BMPs are not being properly inspected or maintained. 
(8)  The city may maintain any BMP which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the storm sewer system or surface waters. The owner of the BMP shall be responsible for any charges that are associated with this work and is required to enter into an agreement with the city providing for the same. 
(9)  Requirements (1)-(8) above are transferrable to any party that becomes the owner/operator of the site where the private BMP is located. 
(p)  Land disturbance and erosion and sediment control. Conformance to the city's land disturbance and erosion and sediment control ordinance and the current requirements found in the MPCA's general stormwater permit for construction activity are required in addition to the requirements of this division.

The city shall inspect the construction site prior to the beginning of the land disturbance to ensure that protective fencing and other protective measures are in place. No encroachment, land disturbance, trenching, filling, compaction, or change in soil chemistry shall occur within the fenced areas protecting the critical root zone of the trees to be saved. 
(e)  Allowable tree removal. Up to thirty (30) percent of the diameter inches of significant trees on any parcel of land being developed may be removed without replacement requirements. Replacement according to the tree replacement schedule is required when removal exceeds more than thirty (30) percent of the total significant tree diameter inches. 
The following types of trees do not need to be included as part of the tally of tree removals: 
(1)  Dead, diseased, or dying trees; 
(2)  Trees that are transplanted from the site to another appropriate area within the city; 
(3)  Trees that were planted as part of a commercial business such as a tree farm or nursery; or 
(4)  Trees that were planted by the current property owner. In making such determination, the city shall consider consistency of the age of the trees, any patterns in the location of the trees, historical aerial photography, and evidence of intentional planting such as invoices, formal planting plans, or cost sharing agreements. 
(f)  Mitigation. 
(1)  In any development where the allowable tree removal is exceeded, the applicant shall mitigate the tree loss by either: 
a.  Planting replacement trees in appropriate areas within the development in accordance with the tree replacement schedule; 
b.  Planting replacement trees on city property under the direction of the parks and recreation director or a designee; or 
c.  Paying to the city a cash mitigation, based on the diameter inches of required replacement in accordance with the tree replacement schedule. The fee per diameter inch of required replacement is set forth in the city's fee schedule. The payment shall be deposited into an account designated specifically for tree planting. 
(2)  The form of mitigation to be provided by the applicant shall be determined by the city. 
(3)  The planting of trees for mitigation on residential projects shall be in addition to any other landscape requirements of the city. 
(4)  All trees, except ornamental trees, planted as landscaping on commercial projects may be counted towards tree replacement requirements. 
(g)  Tree replacement calculations. Thirty (30) percent of the total diameter inches of significant trees on the site may be removed without replacement. The allowable thirty (30) percent removal is first credited to the common trees removed, then the conifers, and lastly the hardwood species. 
The following calculation procedure must be used to determine tree replacement requirements: 
(1)  Tally the total number of diameter inches of significant trees on the site. 
(2)  Calculate thirty (30) percent of the total diameter inches of significant trees on the site. This is the allowable tree removal limit, or the number of inches that can be removed without replacement. 
(3)  Tally the total diameter inches of common trees that will be removed, and subtract this number from the allowable tree removal limit. 
(4)  If there are any allowable inches left, tally the total diameter inches of coniferous/evergreen tree species that will be removed, and subtract this number from the remaining allowable inches. 
(5)  If there are any allowable inches left, tally the total diameter inches of hardwood deciduous tree species that will be removed, and subtract this number from the remaining allowable inches. 
If at any point in the above calculation procedure the number of inches to be removed exceeds the thirty (30) percent allowable removal limit, the remaining inches of removal above the allowable limit must be replaced according to the tree replacement schedule in subsection (h). 
(h)  Tree replacement schedule. Tree removals over the allowable tree removal limit on the parcel shall be replaced according to the following schedule: 
(1)  Common tree species shall be replaced with new trees, at a rate of one-eighth ( 1/8 ) the diameter inches removed. Replacement trees must be a minimum of one (1) inch in diameter. 
(2)  Coniferous/evergreen species shall be replaced with new trees, either coniferous or deciduous, at a rate of one-fourth (1/4) the diameter inches removed. Replacement trees must be a minimum of one (1) inch in diameter. Since coniferous species are often sold by height rather than diameter inch, the following conversion formula can be used: 
Height of replacement coniferous tree/2 = Diameter inches of credit. 
(3)  Hardwood deciduous tree species shall be replaced with new hardwood deciduous trees at a rate of one-half (1/2) the diameter inches removed. Replacement trees must be a minimum of one (1) inch in diameter. 
(i)  Species requirement. The city must approve all species used for tree replacement. Ornamental trees are not acceptable for use as replacement trees. Where ten or more replacement trees are required, not more than thirty (30) percent of the replacement trees shall be of the same species of tree. 
(j)  Warranty requirement. Any replacement tree which is not alive or healthy, as determined by the city, or which subsequently dies due to construction activity within two (2) years after the date of project closure shall be removed by the applicant and replaced with a new healthy tree meeting the same minimum size requirements within eight (8) months of removal. 
(k)  Required protective measures. The tree preservation plan shall identify and require the following measures to be utilized to protect significant trees: 
(1)  Installation of snow fencing or polyethylene laminate safety netting placed at the drip line or at the perimeter of the critical root zone, whichever is greater, of significant trees, specimen trees, and significant woodlands to be preserved. No grade change, construction activity, or storage of materials shall occur within this fenced area. 
(2)  Identification of any oak trees requiring pruning between April 15 and July 1. Any oak trees so pruned shall be required to have any cut areas sealed with an appropriate nontoxic tree wound sealant. 
(3)  Prevention of change in soil chemistry due to concrete washout and leakage or spillage of toxic materials, such as fuels or paints. 
(4)  Removal of any nuisance trees located in areas to be preserved. 
(l)  Additional protective measures. The following tree protection measures are suggested to protect significant trees that are intended to be preserved according to the submitted tree preservation plan, and may be required by the city: 
(1)  Installation of retaining walls or tree wells to preserve trees. 
(2)  Placement of utilities in common trenches outside of the drip line of significant trees, or use of tunneled installation. 
(3)  Use of tree root aeration, fertilization, and/or irrigation systems. 
(4)  Therapeutic pruning. 
(m)  Incentives. As an incentive to protect contiguous wooded areas that include a large proportion of significant trees, the city will allow the following: 
(1)  Density transfer. Contiguous wooded areas shall be platted as outlots and dedicated at no cost to the city. These areas can be utilized for a density transfer or for a reduction in gross development area subject to area charges. Some or all of the density associated with the dedicated area may be transferred for use elsewhere in the project area at the sole discretion of the city consistent with an approved planned unit development in accordance with chapter 24, article IV. If allowed density for the outlot area is transferred elsewhere within the development, the outlot area will remain as part of the gross developable area for the purpose of calculating area charges, park dedication and other development fees. If the density transfer is not used, dedicated outlot areas will be subtracted from the gross development area for the purpose of calculating area charges, park dedication, and other development fees. Density calculations will be documented with a recorded document for future reference. 
(2)  Unit bonus. Projects that provide for dedication of contiguous wooded areas to the city over and above normal park dedication requirements may be eligible for a density bonus in accordance with the city's adopted density bonus policy. 
(n)  Compliance with the plan. The applicant shall implement the tree preservation plan prior to and during any construction. The tree protection measures shall remain in place until all land disturbance and construction activity is terminated or until a request to remove the tree protection measures is made to, and approved by, the city. 
(1)  No significant trees shall be removed until a tree preservation plan is approved and except in accordance with the approved tree preservation plan as approved by the city. If a significant tree(s) intended to be preserved is removed or damaged to the point that city staff believes the tree will not survive, a cash mitigation, calculated per diameter inch of the removed/damaged tree in the amount set forth in the city fee schedule, shall be remitted to the city. 
(2)  The city shall have the right to inspect the development and/or building site in order to determine compliance with the approved tree preservation plan. The city shall determine whether compliance with the tree preservation plan has been met. 
(o)  Specimen trees. Removal of any specimen tree shall require a special permit in addition to the other requirements in section 27-40. 
(Ord. No. 1839, § 1839.01, 3-9-2011) 
Sec. 27-41. - Tree protection standards for nondeveloping properties. 
(a)  Undeveloped parcels. 
(1)  There are no restrictions or permit requirements for removal of dead, diseased, or dying trees. 
(2)  Landowners not developing their property may remove up to thirty (30) percent of the trees on their property, based on wooded area as of the date of approval of this chapter, provided fourteen (14) days prior notice is given to the city. 
(3)  If more than thirty (30) percent of the trees on the property are to be removed for forest management purposes, the landowner must notify the city fourteen (14) days before the removals are to take place and supply the city with an approved forest management plan developed and approved by the department of natural resources' regional forester. 
(4)  If a forest management plan is not prepared, a permit for the removals must be obtained from the city. The permit application must include a tree inventory, certified by a forester or landscape architect, which includes the size, species, and location of all existing significant trees located on the property. 
(5)  Upon receipt of a completed tree removal permit application, and compliance with this division the city will issue a permit within fourteen (14) days to allow removal of the trees. 
(6)  If, within a ten-year time period of receiving a tree removal permit the property is developed, the developer will be responsible for replacing the trees that were previously removed in accordance with section 27-40(g), tree replacement calculations, and section 27-40(h), tree replacement schedule. 
(b)  Unauthorized tree removal on undeveloped parcels. 
(1)  The city may record a notice of tree replacement requirement against non developing property if any of the following situations occur: 
(i)  A landowner removes more than thirty (30) percent of the trees on their property (on an areal basis) without supplying the city with an approved forest management plan developed and approved by the department of natural resources' regional forester; or 
(ii)  A landowner removes more than thirty (30) percent of the trees on their property (on an areal basis) without supplying the city with a tree inventory before the removals take place. 
(2)  The calculation for potential future tree replacement requirement will be made based on the area of trees removed. Baseline tree cover will be calculated from the April 10, 2009 aerial photos provided by Washington County. 
(3)  Tree replacement for trees removed as outlined in subsection (b)(1) above will be calculated by applying a formula of two (2) inches of replacement for every one hundred (100) square feet of trees removed. 
(4)  If, within ten (10) years of the date of the removals the property is developed, a fee equivalent to the tree replacement fee in effect at the time of development will be required to be paid to the city, or the appropriate amount of tree replacement must be planted as part of the development plan. 
(5)  If more than ten (10) years have passed from the date of the removals, no fee or tree replacement will be required. 
(c)  Platted residential lots. 
(1)  Owners of platted residential lots may remove up to one hundred (100) percent of the trees on the lot without replacement, with the exception of specimen trees. 
(2)  Before a specimen tree is removed, an owner must obtain a permit from the city. 
(d)  Existing developed commercial properties. 
(1)  Trees that are removed must be replaced in accordance with the original landscaping plan, unless city approval is obtained for an alternative landscaping scheme. If the original landscaping plan is not available, trees identified by appropriate aerial photo will be assumed to be part of the original landscape plan. 
(2)  Trees that are removed that were part of a designated tree preservation area must be replaced in accordance with the tree replacement requirements outlined in section 27-40(h). The thirty (30) percent allowable tree removal limit does not apply in these situations. 
(Ord. No. 1839, § 1839.01, 3-9-2011; Ord. No. 1899, § 1, 4-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 27-42. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Exception standards. Notwithstanding the city's desire to accomplish the tree protection goals outlined in section 27-38, there may be instances where these goals are in conflict with other city objectives. These conflicts are most likely to occur on small, heavily wooded parcels. At the discretion of the city council, exceptions may be granted if all of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The subject parcel is five (5) acres in size or less; 
(2)  It is not feasible to combine the subject parcel with adjacent parcels that could use the parcel as required green space; 
(3)  Strict adherence to the requirements of the tree ordinance would prevent reasonable development that is consistent with the comprehensive plan and desirable to the city on the parcel; and 
(4)  The exception requested is the minimum needed to accomplish the desired development. 
(b)  Reduced mitigation for exceptions. If an exception is granted, relief from the requirements of the ordinance may take the form of reduced mitigation requirements, greater allowable tree removal, higher thresholds for determining significant trees, or any combination of the above. The city council will determine which form of relief best balances the objectives of the city and tree preservation.

(Ord. No. 1839, § 1839.01, 3-9-2011) 
Sec. 27-54. - Shade tree disease program. 
(a)  It is the duty of the city forester to coordinate all activities of the city relating to the control and prevention of shade tree disease and pests. The forester shall recommend the details of a program for the control of shade tree disease and pests and perform the duties of such a program. 
(b)  It is unlawful for any person to prevent, delay or interfere with the forester while the forester is engaged in the performance of duties under this division. 
(c)  It is unlawful for any person to permit any nuisance tree as defined in section 27-53 to remain on any premises owned or controlled by the person within the city. Such nuisance trees may be abated in the manner prescribed by this division. 
(d)  Inspection and investigation. 
(1)  The forester may enter upon private premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of carrying out of any of the duties assigned under this division with prior notification to landowner. In situations of imminent danger to human life and safety, notification is not necessary. 
(2)  The forester has the authority to inspect properties within the city to determine whether any nuisance tree exists thereon. The forester has the authority to investigate all reported incidents of shade tree disease or shade tree pests. 
(3)  The forester has the authority to, upon finding conditions indicating shade tree disease or shade tree pests, remove samples or specimens for further diagnosis, or take such other steps for diagnosis as may be recommended by the commissioner of agriculture. No action to remove nuisance trees or wood shall be ordered until the forester finds with reasonable certainty a shade tree disease or shade tree pest is present. 
(e)  Abatement of a nuisance tree shall be by spraying, removing, burning or otherwise effectively treating the nuisance tree or wood to prevent the spread of shade tree disease and shade tree pests. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance with current technical and expert opinions and plans as designated by the commissioner of agriculture. 
(f)  Whenever the forester finds with reasonable certainty that a shade tree disease or shade tree pest infestation exists on any public or private property in the city, the forester has the authority to follow the procedures below: 
(1)  If the danger of infestation of other trees is not imminent because of shade tree disease or shade tree pest dormancy, the forester may choose to reinspect either later in the same growing season or at the beginning of the following growing season before the active period. If at that time the tree has not recovered, the forester shall proceed by notifying the property owner that the nuisance tree must be abated within a specified time. If the property owner fails to abate the nuisance tree by said period of time, the forester may proceed by abating the nuisance as a public improvement under M.S. Ch. 429. 
(2)  If danger of infestation of other trees by shade tree disease or shade tree pest is imminent, the forester shall proceed by notifying the property owner that the nuisance tree must be abated within a specified time. If the property owner fails to abate the nuisance tree by said period of time the forester may proceed by abating the nuisance as a public improvement under M.S. Ch. 429. 
(g)  Chemical treatment. 
(1)  Whenever the forester determines that any tree within the city is infected with shade tree disease or shade tree pest, the forester may chemically treat all nearby high value trees with an effective fungicide or insecticide. Chemical treatment authorized by this section shall be conducted in accordance with technical and expert opinions and plans of the commissioner of agriculture and under the supervision of the commissioner and agents whenever possible. 
(2)  The notice provisions in subsection (f) apply to chemical treatments conducted under this section.

DIVISION 6. - LANDSCAPING AND LAWNCARE 

Sec. 27-64. - Purpose. 
    Some areas of the city are landscaped with closely manicured lawns that are typical of an urban setting. Other areas in the city have been, by design, allowed to remain or return to a natural state that provides a more natural character. 
    Natural areas provide environmental benefits. These areas serve as wildlife corridors and provide food, cover, and nesting habitat for wildlife. The additional vegetation alleviates the impacts of stormwater that can create erosion and can also remove sediment and nutrients from stormwater. 
    There are expectations, however, that properties in suburban areas should be maintained to a standard compatible with surrounding properties. Because of the difference between the appearances of natural areas versus more manicured areas, it is important that natural areas be established in appropriate locations. 
    The purpose of this regulation is to provide a minimum standard for lawn maintenance that will allow a variety of landscapes in appropriate locations throughout the community.

    City is the City of Woodbury. 
    Designated natural area is an area approved by city to be a natural area. 
    Easement is a grant by an owner of land for specific use by a person or persons other than the owner. An easement may be granted for the purpose of constructing and maintaining walkways, roadways, utilities, and other uses. 
    Eight-inch standard is the height to which all weeds and grass must be maintained. Weeds and grass must not exceed a height of eight inches from the base at ground level to the highest tip of each stalk, stem, blade or leaf. 
    Fertilizer is a substance containing one or more recognized plant nutrients that is used for its plant nutrient content and designed for use or claimed to have value in promoting plant growth. Fertilizer does not include animal and vegetable manures that are not manipulated, marl, lime, limestone, and other products exempted by rule by the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture. 
    Garden is a cultivated area dedicated to growing vegetables, fruits, flowers, shrubs and similar plants that were specifically planted in that location. 
    Lawn is the portion of a lot capable of growing vegetation. 
    Lot is a parcel of land. Where a lot is adjacent to a street or road with a curb and gutter the lot shall include the right-of-way between the property and the curb. 
    Natural standard or natural area is an area purposely left to grow in a natural state. It contains vegetation that can maintain itself in a stable condition without human intervention. The vegetation can consist of primarily grasses, native plants, shrubs and trees. Flowers and non-native plants may be allowed. If weeds are present, they must be controlled so as to remain a minor portion of the vegetation. Natural areas may be unmowed or mowed intermittently. 
    Noxious weeds are annual, biennial, or perennial plants that the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture designates to be injurious to public health, the environment, public roads, crops, livestock, or other property. 
    Open space means open areas, including parks, natural areas, playgrounds, and trails. 
    Public open space is open space owned by the city, county, state, school district or a special district. 
    Prohibited noxious weeds are weeds that must be eradicated or controlled in accordance with the Minnesota Noxious Weed Law and designated by the commissioner of agriculture.

For the purpose of this division, the words "must" and "shall" are mandatory and not permissive. 
    Alternative Urban Areawide Review (AUAR) is an alternative form of environmental review as detailed in Minnesota Rules 4410.3610. The content and format of an AUAR is similar to that of the EAW, but provides for a level of analysis comparable to that of an EIS. 
    Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) is a brief document which is designed to assess the environmental effects and to set out the basic facts necessary to determine whether an EIS is required for a proposed project or to initiate the scoping process for an EIS. 
    Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is a detailed written statement as required by M.S. § 116D.04, subdivision 2a used to evaluate proposed projects which have the potential for significant environmental effects. 
    Mitigation is: 
(1)  Avoiding impacts altogether by not undertaking a certain project or parts of a project; 
(2)  Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree of magnitude of a project; 
(3)  Rectifying impacts by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment; 
(4)  Reducing or eliminating impacts over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the project; 
(5)  Compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments; or 
(6)  Reducing or avoiding impacts by implementation of pollution prevention measures.

Sec. 27-78. - General provisions. 
(a)  No decision on granting a permit or other final approval required to commence a project may be issued until the environmental review process is completed. 
(b)  Environmental reviews shall be conducted as early as practical in the processing of a development project. Time delays in the normal permit process caused by the filing and review of the EAW, EIS or AUAR shall not be considered part of the normal permit approval time requirements. Such delays shall be considered as additional required time for each required permit. The permit process for the proposed project may be continued from the point it was interrupted by the environmental review process. 
(Ord. No. 1839, § 1839.01, 3-9-2011) 
Sec. 27-79. - Environmental assessment worksheets. 
(a)  Preparation of an EAW shall be mandatory for those projects that meet or exceed the EAW thresholds contained in Minnesota Rules 4410.4300 or the EIS thresholds in Minnesota Rules 4410.4400. 
(b)  A discretionary EAW may be required when it is determined that, because of the nature or location of a proposed project, the project may have the potential for significant environmental effects. The city council may require the preparation of a discretionary EAW if it is suspected that a development project may have the potential for significant environmental impact. 
(c)  If the community development director determines that an EAW shall be prepared, it is at the city's sole discretion to determine the EAW preparation process.

DIVISION 9. - ENFORCEMENT OF STATUTORY PROHIBITION ON USE OR SALE OF COAL TAR SEALANTS 

Sec. 27-105. - Purpose. 
    The City of Woodbury understands that lakes, rivers, streams and other bodies of water are assets that enhance the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic resources and contribute to the general health and welfare of the community. The use of sealers on asphalt driveways is a common practice. However, scientific studies on the use of asphalt based driveway sealers have demonstrated a relationship between stormwater runoff from sealed areas and certain health and environmental concerns. The 2013 Minnesota Legislature enacted a statewide prohibition on the use and sale of coal tar sealant products. This new statewide prohibition has been codified under M.S. § 116.202 and is effective on January 1, 2014. The purpose of this article is to prohibit violations of M.S. § 116.202 in the City of Woodbury, in order to protect, restore, and preserve the quality of its waters.
