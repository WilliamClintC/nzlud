PREFACE 
    The North Kansas City, Missouri Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Rosina Sparks, city clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 16, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 9183, adopted March 19, 2019 and Ordinance No. 9181, adopted May 7, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 16 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 16, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 16 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 16, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. __, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

c.  Is the disabled member's average monthly compensation, determined as of the date of his or her termination of employment due to duty-caused total disability; 
3.  Is an amount equal to sixty (60) percent of the average monthly compensation of such disabled member, calculated as of August 22, 1994. The board of trustees shall cause the actuary for the retirement fund to determine and report to the board of trustees the amount of the minimum duty-caused disability benefit for the members to whom such minimum benefit applies. The trustees shall permanently maintain such report as part of the retirement fund's records. 
B.  The disabled member's years of service under Section 2.64.150 shall be equal to the disabled member's actual years of service when his or her employment is terminated due to a duty-caused total disability, plus his or her imputed years of service from such termination date to the disabled member's normal retirement date. If a disabled member has partial years of service (either partial years of actual service or imputed service or both) each complete month of such partial years of service shall be counted as a one-twelfth fraction of a year of service. 
C.  In either event, credit for years of service toward retirement will be granted during such total and permanent disability and such total and permanent disability shall not count as a break in continuous service. Such disability pension benefit shall terminate upon the earliest of the following: 
1.  Recovery from such total disability; 
2.  Eligibility for normal retirement benefits; or 
3.  The death of the disabled member. 
D.  A member receiving a disability pension under this section shall, upon the attainment of his or her normal retirement age under Section 2.64.080, receive a normal retirement pension equal to the then amount of the disabled member's benefit under this section, in lieu of his normal retirement benefit under Section 2.64.120, taking into consideration any cost of living adjustment under Section 2.64.310 and, if elected by the member, payable in the form of an actuarial equivalent joint and survivorship benefit under Section 2.64.140. 
E.  The provisions of this section do not apply to a Section 2.64.330 DROP account retiree.

2.64.160 - Nonduty caused disability. 
A.  Any member of the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund who has become totally and permanently disabled after five years of service, who is employed as a police officer or firefighter of the city (or on an approved leave of absence) and who does not qualify for normal retirement benefits under Section 2.64.120 or a duty caused disability under Section 2.64.150 shall be retired immediately on a disability pension. Total disability, as used herein, shall mean that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty for the city as certified by the medical officer designated by the board; provided, that the medical officer shall also certify that such mental or physical incapacity shall likely remain permanent and that the member should be retired as a member of the police department or the fire department. 
B.  Disability occurring as a direct and proximate result of employment with an employer other than the city, shall not be cause for a claim under this section. 
C.  Such disability pension benefit shall be paid monthly in an amount equal to the greater of (1) or (2), where: 
1.  Is the member's accrued benefit, calculated as of the date of the member's termination of employment due to total and permanent disability; and 
2.  Is twenty-five (25) percent of the member's average monthly compensation for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the effective date of the member's disability retirement. In addition there shall also be paid a sum equal to five percent of the average monthly compensation for the twelve (12) months immediately preceding disability retirement that the member was receiving at the time of his or her retirement for each unmarried dependent child under the age of eighteen (18), and each unmarried child, regardless of age, who is totally and permanently mentally or physically incapacitated from engaging in gainful employment sufficiently remunerative to support himself or herself. Such additional sum shall not be paid to or for more than three eligible children, and if there are more than three eligible children, then payments shall be made for the three youngest eligible children; and further provided, that no benefits under this section shall be paid to or for any child or children over eighteen (18) years of age who are totally and permanently mentally or physically incapacitated if such child is a patient or ward in a publicly supported institution, and no benefits shall be paid under this section to or for any child born or adopted after the effective date of the member's disability retirement. 
D.  Credit for service during such total and permanent disability shall not be granted; however, disability hereunder shall not count as a break in continuous service. Such disability pension benefits shall terminate upon the earlier of the following: 
1.  Recovery from such disability; 
2.  Eligibility for normal retirement benefits; or 
3.  The death of such disabled member. 
E.  A member receiving a disability pension under this section shall, upon the attainment of his or her normal retirement age under Section 2.64.080, receive a normal retirement pension equal to the then amount of the disabled member's benefit under this section, in lieu of his or her normal retirement benefit under Section 2.64.120, taking into consideration any cost of living adjustment under Section 2.64.310 and, if elected by the member, payable in the form of an actuarial equivalent joint and survivorship benefit under Section 2.64.140. 
F.  The provisions of this section do not apply to a Section 2.64.330 DROP account retiree.

2.64.170 - Recovery from disability. 
    The board of trustees may require, at such time as the board may direct, that any member who is receiving a disability pension as provided in Section 2.64.150 or 264.160, submit to a medical examination at a place and time designated by the board. The medical examination shall be performed by the board's medical officer, or, in special cases, by another physician or physicians designated by the board. If the medical officer (or other physician) certifies to the board of trustees that a member is no longer totally and permanently disabled, the board shall discontinue the member's disability pension. Should any member who is receiving a disability pension refuse to submit to such medical examination, the member's disability pension benefits shall be discontinued until the member complies with the requirements set forth in this section. If such member's refusal continues for more than one year, all rights in and to his or her disability pension, including credit for years of service, shall be forfeited. 
(Prior code § 2-137) 
(Ord. No. 8486, § 2, 8-24-2010) 
2.64.180 - Death benefits. 
A.  A death benefit will be paid upon the death of any active member: 
1.  While eligible to retire in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.64.080; or 
2.  After ten (10) years of service if not eligible to retire in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.64.090. 
B.  Such death benefit shall be in the form of a monthly income and shall be an amount equal to the monthly joint and survivorship benefit that would have been payable to a surviving spouse in accordance with Section 2.64.140 as if the member had retired as of the date of his or her death after electing the joint and survivorship option. In determining the amount of monthly death benefit hereunder, the calculation will be predicated upon the deceased member's actual years of service and the assumption that the date of death coincided with his or her normal retirement date. The death benefit shall be payable as follows: 
1.  Such a member, who dies before the first day of the first month for which a retirement benefit is payable and who has a surviving spouse, shall have his or her death benefit paid to his or her surviving spouse in the joint and survivorship benefit form pursuant to Section 2.64.140. The member's spouse may direct that payment of the joint and survivorship benefit commence at the time the member would have attained his or her early retirement date under Section 2.64.090. If the spouse does not so direct, payment of such benefit will commence at the time the member would have attained his or her normal retirement date. 
2.  If there is no surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse dies or remarries, the death benefit shall be divided among any of the deceased member's children under the age of eighteen (18) years in equal shares; provided, that as each child attains the age of eighteen (18) years said benefit shall then be divided among the remaining children under the age of eighteen (18) years until there are no remaining children who so qualify, at which time all benefits hereunder shall cease. For the purposes of this section, the term "children" shall mean only dependent children of the deceased, both natural and adopted. Any such child, eighteen (18) years of age or older, who is physically or mentally incapacitated from entering into gainful employment shall, so long as such incapacity exists as certified by the medical board, such certification to be renewed annually, be considered to be less than eighteen (18) years of age for the purposes of this Section 2.64.180; provided that if any so incapacitated child shall marry, such child shall not thereafter be entitled to any benefit hereunder. 
    If, when death benefits cease to be paid under subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section, the total death benefits paid under this section is less than the member's employee contributions with interest as provided in Section 2.64.200 to the date of death, the excess of such employee contributions, with interest, over the total death benefits shall be paid to the member's beneficiary or estate if no designated beneficiary survives. 
C.  Upon the death of a member who has retired on a disability pension, a death benefit will be paid: (1) if such death occurs within two years following the effective date of the member's disability retirement; and (2) if such member would have been eligible for a death benefit as provided above if his or her death had occurred on the effective date of his or her disability retirement. The death benefit payable hereunder shall be determined as provided in this section and shall commence with the first monthly payment due next following his or her date of death. The joint and survivorship actuarial equivalent reduction shall be calculated at the date of his or her death. This determination, in the event there is no surviving spouse, shall assume the spouse's attained age is the same as that of the member. 
D.  It is intended that the retirement fund shall comply with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations and rulings which apply to governmental plans pursuant to Section 823 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Therefore, death benefits shall begin by no later than the end of the calendar year in which a member, whose benefits are not in pay status and whose survivors are entitled to death benefits hereunder, dies. Except as provided in this subsection as to Code Section 401(a)(9), the provisions of this Section 2.64.180 do not apply to a Section 2.64.330 DROP account retiree. 
E.  If a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while in "qualified military service", as defined in Section 414(u)(5) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, the member shall be treated as an "active member" for the purpose of determining the death benefits payable to the member's spouse or children pursuant to this Section 2.64.180.

2.64.190 - Medical officer. 
    The board of trustees shall appoint a physician to be known as the medical officer who shall make all physical examinations required by this chapter. The fees for such examination shall be paid by the board of trustees out of the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund and the medical officer shall receive for each examination such fee as the board of trustees shall approve. 
(Prior code § 2-139) 
2.64.200 - Employee contributions and pick-up contributions. 
A.  Each member shall contribute, by means of monthly salary deductions, five percent of his salary through November 30, 2001. Effective from and after December 1, 2001 to April 5, 2013, each member shall contribute, by means of monthly salary deductions, one and one-tenths percent of his salary and the city shall contribute three and nine-tenths of the salary of each member for each month the member makes salary deduction contributions. These city contributions shall be in addition to any other contributions the city may otherwise make to the retirement fund and shall be accounted for by the retirement fund as city contributions, not as employee contributions. Effective from and after October 1, 2002, neither DROP account retirees who elected the DROP account option prior to April 5, 2013, nor the city shall make the employee and city contributions described herein. Pick-up contributions by the city and additional city contributions described in subsection B of this section shall apply to and are required for members who first elect the DROP account option on or after April 6, 2013. A member may not elect to opt-out of the pick-up (or elect to receive the pick-up contributions, rather than have them paid to the retirement fund). 
B.  Effective April 6, 2013, the city, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2), will "pick-up" and pay the contributions that would otherwise be payable by members as prescribed herein. The contributions picked up shall be treated as city contributions for purposes of determining the amounts of federal and state income taxes to withhold from the member's compensation, but shall be included in member compensation, as defined in Section 2.64.020 and for Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax purposes. Pick-up contributions will be paid from reductions to the salary or regular hourly pay of a member in an amount equal to three and one-tenth percent of the member's salary or regular hourly rate of pay. A member may not elect to opt-out of the pick-up (or elect to receive the pick-up contributions, rather than have them paid to the retirement fund). The city shall contribute an additional six and nine-tenths percent of the salary or regular hourly rate of pay for each member for whom pick-up contributions are made by the city. These city contributions shall be in addition to any other contributions the city may otherwise make to the retirement fund. 
C.  Effective from September 1, 2004 to April 5, 2013, employee and city contributions, in the case of a member who completes thirty (30) years of service prior to age fifty-five (55) and continues in active employment for the city, shall cease as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the date the member completes thirty (30) years of service prior to age fifty-five (55). When such a member attains age fifty-five (55) and continues employment for the city as a police officer or firefighter, the then required employee and city contributions shall resume and continue until the member actually retires or elects DROP account status. Furthermore, as soon as practicable after October 1, 2007, the retirement fund shall return employee contributions made by a member during the period of time after such a member has completed thirty (30) years of service and prior to the date such member has attained age fifty-five (55) (including any active employees who elected DROP account status). Such return of employee contributions shall include the portion of the interest credited to such contributions through September 30, 2007, which is attributable to the return of such employee contributions. Such return of employee contributions shall not apply to members whose benefits are in pay status on September 30, 2007, or who are not active employees of the city on September 30, 2007. Effective April 6, 2013, pick-up contributions and other city contributions described in subsection B of this section shall apply to any member who completes thirty (30) years of service prior to age fifty-five (55) and continues in active employment for the city. 
D.  In the event that all pick-up contributions and/or employee contributions should be returned to the member or paid to his beneficiary, employee contributions shall be credited with interest from the end of the plan year in which such employee contributions were made to the first day of the month immediately preceding such return of any employee contributions. The rate at which interest shall be credited during any plan year will be the interest rate used in the actuarial valuation for the previous valuation year through September 30, 1990, and the federal mid-term rate under Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor thereto, compounded annually, as of the first day of each plan year thereafter. 
E.  Each member shall designate a beneficiary to receive any benefits due under this section. 
F.  Any member who leaves the service of his or her respective department prior to retirement and who is entitled to no benefit under any other provision of this retirement fund shall have his or her pick-up contributions and/or employee contributions, with interest, paid to him or her. A member who leaves the service of his respective department and is entitled to a deferred vested normal retirement benefit under Section 2.64.130 may elect to have his or her pick-up contributions and/or employee contributions paid to the member, with interest, but such payment of pick-up contributions and/or employee contributions shall prevent the member from receiving any other benefits under the retirement fund. 
G.  If a member who has not elected a joint and survivorship option dies after retirement (normal, early, late or disability) but prior to receiving retirement benefits equal to his or her total employee contributions with interest to the date retirement benefits or DROP account credits started, the excess of such employee contributions with interest over the sum of: (1) the aggregate retirement benefits; and (2) any DROP account credits received by the member, shall be paid to his or her beneficiary.

2.64.210 - Annual actuarial valuation and report. 
    The board of trustees shall cause the actuary to make an annual actuarial valuation of the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund on the retirement fund's actuarial valuation date ("actuarial valuation date" shall mean the first day of the plan year) and to make an annual report on such valuation and on the actuarial soundness of the fund. This report shall include the balances as of the actuarial valuation date of any DROP accounts. The board of trustees shall keep such records as are necessary for the purpose of this report. 
(Ord. 7593 § K, 2002: prior code § 2-141) 
2.64.220 - Accounts. 
    The city treasurer shall supervise all monies, securities and other assets of the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund, subject to the control and direction of the board of trustees. The city treasurer may, if directed by the board of trustees, and if not in conflict with controlling law, delegate this responsibility to any trust company or the trust department of any bank in the United States. Such a bank or trust company may also be a discretionary "investment fiduciary," as defined in Section 2.64.230(B), with respect to the retirement fund. The city treasurer shall keep books and complete accounts of the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund and such books and accounts shall always be subject to the inspection of the board of trustees. The city treasurer shall be bonded at the expense of the fund for all of his or her acts concerning the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund. On the expiration of his or her term of office, he or she shall deliver to his or her successor all monies, securities and other assets in his or her possession and all books, records and accounts which have come into his or her possession as treasurer of the police officers' and firefighters' retirement fund.

2.64.300 - One time cost of living adjustment for certain retirement benefits in pay status. 
    The monthly retirement benefit of each retired member who retired and commenced receiving monthly benefits prior to October 1, 1990, shall be increased, effective for monthly benefit payments made on or after October 1, 1992, by an amount equal to three percent of the retired member's monthly retirement benefit as of October 1, 1992, multiplied by the number of complete years that the retired member's monthly retirement benefit has been in pay status. If the retired member's monthly retirement benefit is being paid in the form of a joint and survivorship benefit pursuant to Section 2.64.140, the survivor's benefit shall be equal to fifty (50) percent of the monthly benefit payable to the retired member, as increased by this one-time cost of living adjustment. In the event the foregoing cost-of-living adjustment should be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be violative of the Missouri Constitution or otherwise violative of Missouri law, then any retired member who retired and commenced receiving monthly benefits prior to October 1, 1990, shall, upon application to the board of trustees be employed by either the city or by the retirement fund, effective as of October 1, 1992, as a special advisor and supervisor.

The monthly benefit as set forth in Sections 2.64.090 (early retirement), 2.64.100 (late retirement), 2.64.120 (normal retirement), 2.64.150 (duty-caused disability) or 2.64.160 (nonduty caused disability) hereof, whichever is applicable, payable to an eligible member who first retired or became disabled on or after August 23, 1994, shall be increased as of each January 1 after the commencement of his or her benefits by a cost of living adjustment which shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the cost of living adjustment which was applied to increase Social Security benefits as of the immediately preceding December 1 (as announced in the Federal Register pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1382f) or (b) four percent. Effective as of January 1, 2014, this cost of living adjustment shall be (a) the cost of living adjustment which was applied to increase Social Security benefits as of the immediately preceding December 1 (as announced in the Federal Register pursuant to 42 USC 1382(f), but (b) not less than one percent, nor (c) more than three percent. If a monthly benefit is payable to a surviving spouse (as defined in Section 2.64.140) or child (as defined in Section 2.64.180) of a deceased eligible member pursuant to Section 2.64.140 (joint and survivorship benefit) or Section 2.64.180 (death benefit), such benefit shall also be increased as of each January 1 after the commencement of such benefit at the same cost of living adjustment rate. If an eligible member, surviving spouse or child's monthly benefit commences as of a January 1, the cost of living adjustment provided for shall first apply as of the immediately following January 1. If an eligible member, surviving spouse or child's monthly benefit commences as of a day other than a January 1, the cost of living adjustment shall also first apply as of the immediately following January 1, but shall be equal to the amount determined by multiplying (1) by (2), where: 
1.  Is the amount of cost of living adjustment otherwise determined pursuant to this section; and 
2.  Is a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of complete months for which the member and/or the surviving spouse and/or surviving child received monthly benefit payments during the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable cost of living adjustment and the denominator of which is twelve (12).

If a retired member's monthly retirement benefit is being paid in the form of a joint and survivorship benefit pursuant to Section 2.64.140, the survivor's benefit shall be equal to fifty (50) percent of the monthly benefit payable to the retired member, as increased by this one-time cost of living adjustment. 
B.

2.  If a person's monthly retirement benefit is being paid in the form of a joint and survivorship benefit pursuant to Section 2.64.140, the survivor's benefit shall be equal to fifty (50) percent of the monthly benefit and salary payable to the retired member, as increased by this monthly salary.

The member's DROP account shall also be credited with interest pursuant to Section 2.64.200 as hereinafter provided, until his or her actual retirement, which must be on or before the member's mandatory retirement age, or if earlier, five years after such member commences DROP status. The five year maximum limitation period in this paragraph A shall not apply to a member who elected DROP account status prior to October 1, 2007. 
B.  Such a retired member is referred to herein as a DROP account retiree. The early, normal or late retirement benefit of a DROP account retiree shall be calculated in accordance with Section 2.64.090, 2.64.100, or 2.64.120, whichever is applicable, as of the date he or she elects shall be the starting date for the monthly credit of his or her early, normal or late retirement benefit to his or her DROP account in the retirement fund. The starting date of the DROP account credits shall be elected by the member, in writing, and must be as of the first day of a month beginning after the DROP account retiree's election is received by the retirement fund. For elections made on or after October 1, 2007, the maximum period of time that a member may remain in DROP account retiree status is five years from the date that his or her DROP election was first effective but not later than the member's mandatory retirement age. 
C.  The DROP account retiree shall be treated by the retirement fund in the same manner as any other retiree is treated, except that the amount of the retiree's early, normal or late retirement benefit shall be credited each month to his DROP account in the retirement fund and shall not be paid to the DROP account retiree until after his or her actual retirement. Prior to the start of credits to a DROP account, a DROP account retiree must elect a form of benefit payment pursuant to Section 2.64.120 or Section 2.64.140. 
D.  Once monthly credits to the DROP account start, such monthly credits shall be increased for any cost of living adjustments that may be made pursuant to Section 2.64.310 at the same time and at the same rate that applies to similarly situated retirees in pay status. 
E.  Additionally, the DROP account of a DROP account retiree shall be credited with interest as of each anniversary date in the same manner and at the same rate of interest that is credited at such time to employee contribution accounts under Section 2.64.200. 
F.  A DROP account retiree shall not be entitled to duty caused disability benefits under Section 2.64.150 or non-duty caused disability benefits under Section 2.64.160. 
G.  If a DROP account retiree dies before his or her actual retirement, any death benefits that may be payable to his or her beneficiary shall be based solely on the form of benefit payment elected before monthly credits to his or her DROP account started, plus the balance of his or her DROP account, credited with interest pursuant to Section 2.64.200 through the end of the month immediately preceding the payment. 
H.  After the actual retirement of a DROP account retiree, no further amounts shall be credited to his or her DROP account, except for interest credits pursuant to Section 2.64.200 through the end of the month immediately preceding distribution of the DROP account. Monthly benefit payments in the amount then being credited to the DROP account retiree shall be paid directly to the retiree beginning as of the first day of the month immediately following the actual retirement of the retiree. 
I.  Additionally, a DROP account shall, at the written election of a DROP account retiree, be distributed to the retiree or, if the DROP account retiree dies before his or her actual retirement, to his or her beneficiary in one of the following forms: 
1.  In a single sum cash payment; 
2.  In a direct rollover to eligible retirement plan, as defined in Section 2.64.020; 
3.  In a combination of the above described forms of payment. 
J.  If a DROP account retiree is reemployed as a full-time police officer or firefighter for the city, the provisions of Section 2.64.390(D) shall apply and the rehired member shall no longer be treated as a DROP account retiree. If the DROP account retiree is reemployed as a part-time police officer or firefighter, the rehired member shall continue to be treated as a DROP account retiree pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.64.390(D).

(Prior code § 16-3) 
Chapter 9.08 - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LIABILITY 
Sections: 

9.08.010 - Voluntary act. 
A.  A person is not guilty of an offense unless his or her liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act. 
B.  A "voluntary act" is: 
1.  A bodily movement performed while conscious as a result of effort or determination; or 
2.  An omission to perform an act of which the actor is physically capable. 
C.  Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procures or receives the thing possessed, or having acquired control of it was aware of his control for a sufficient time to have enabled him to dispose of it or terminate his control. 
D.  A person is not guilty of an offense based solely upon an omission to perform an act unless the law defining the offense expressly so provides, or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law. 
(Prior code § 16-16) 
9.08.020 - Culpable mental state. 
A.  Except as provided in Section 9.08.040, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he or she acts with a culpable mental state, that is, unless he or she acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly or with criminal negligence, as the statute defining the offense may require with respect to the conduct, the result thereof or the attendant circumstances which constitute the material elements of the crime. 
B.  A person "acts purposely" or with purpose, with respect to his or her conduct or to a result thereof when it is his or her conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result. 
C.  A person "acts knowingly" or with knowledge, 
1.  With respect to his or her conduct or to attendant circumstances when he or she is aware of the nature of his or her conduct or that those circumstances exist; or 
2.  With respect to a result of his or her conduct when he or she is aware that his or her conduct is practically certain to cause that result. 
D.  A person "acts recklessly" or is reckless when he or she consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation. 
E.  A person "acts with criminal negligence" or is criminally negligent when he or she fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation. 
(Prior code § 16-17) 
9.08.030 - Culpable mental state-Generally. 
A.  If the definition of an offense prescribes a culpable mental state but does not specify the conduct, attendant circumstances or result to which it applies, the prescribed culpable mental state applies to each such material element. 
B.  Except as provided in Section 9.08.040, if the definition of an offense does not expressly prescribe a culpable mental state, a culpable mental state is nonetheless required and is established if a person acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly, but criminal negligence is not sufficient. 
C.  If the definition of an offense prescribes criminal negligence as the culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely. 
D.  Knowledge that conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of the existence, meaning or application of the ordinance defining an offense is not an element of an offense unless the ordinance clearly so provides. 
(Prior code § 16-18) 
9.08.040 - Same-When not required. 
    A culpable mental state is not required: 
A.  If the offense is an infraction and no culpable mental state is prescribed by the ordinance defining the offense; or 
B.  If the ordinance defining the offense clearly indicates a purpose to dispense with the requirement of any culpable mental state as to a specific element of the offense. 
(Prior code § 16-19) 
9.08.050 - Ignorance and mistake. 
A.  A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he or she engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief of fact or law unless such mistake negatives the existence of the mental state required by the offense. 
B.  A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he or she believes his or her conduct does not constitute an offense unless his or her belief is reasonable and: 
1.  The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order which is not known to him or her and has not been published or otherwise made reasonably available to him or her, and he or she could not have acquired such knowledge by the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him or her; or 
2.  He or she acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in 
a.  A statute or ordinance; 
b.  An opinion or order of an appellate court; 
c.  An official interpretation of the statute, ordinance, regulation or order defining the offense made by a public official or agency legally authorized to interpret such statute, ordinance, regulation or order. 
C.  The burden of injecting the issue of reasonable belief that conduct does not constitute an offense under subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section is on the defendant. 
(Prior code § 16-20) 
9.08.060 - Accountability for conduct. 
    A person with the required culpable mental state is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his or her own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he or she is criminally responsible, or both. 
(Prior code § 16-21) 
9.08.070 - Responsibility for the conduct of another. 
A.  A person is criminally responsible for the conduct of another when: 
1.  The statute defining the offense makes him or her so responsible; or 
2.  Either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose of promoting the commission of an offense, he or she aids or agrees to aid or attempts to aid such other person in planning, committing or attempting to commit the offense. 
B.  However, a person is not so responsible if: 
1.  He or she is the victim of the offense committed or attempted; 
2.  The offense is so defined that his or her conduct was necessarily incident to the commission or attempt to commit the offense. If his or her conduct constitutes a related but separate offense, he or she is criminally responsible for that offense but not for the conduct or offense committed or attempted by the other person; 
3.  Before the commission of the offense he or she abandons his or her purpose and gives timely warning to law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense. 
C.  The defense provided by subsection (B)(3) of this section is an affirmative defense. 
(Prior code § 16-22) 
9.08.080 - Defense precluded. 
    It is no defense to any prosecution for an offense in which the criminal responsibility of the defendant is based upon the conduct of another that: 
A.  Such other person has been acquitted or has not been convicted or has been convicted of some other offense or degree of offense or lacked criminal capacity or was unaware of the defendant's criminal purpose or is immune from prosecution or is not amenable to justice; or 
B.  The defendant does not belong to that class of persons who was legally capable of committing the offense in an individual capacity. 
(Prior code § 16-23) 
9.08.090 - Liability of individual for conduct of corporation or unincorporated association. 
    A person is criminally liable for conduct constituting an offense which he or she performs or causes to be performed in the name of or in behalf of a corporation or unincorporated association to the same extent as if such conduct were performed in his or her own name or behalf. 
(Prior code § 16-24) 
9.08.100 - Entrapment. 
A.  The commission of acts which would otherwise constitute an offense is not criminal if the actor engaged in the prescribed conduct because he or she was entrapped by a law enforcement officer or a person acting in cooperation with such an officer. 
B.  An "entrapment" is perpetuated if a law enforcement officer or a person acting in cooperation with such an officer, for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, solicits, encourages or otherwise induces another person to engage in conduct when he or she was not ready and willing to engage in such conduct. 
C.  The relief afforded by subsection A of this section is not available as to any crime which involves causing physical injury to or placing in danger of physical injury a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment. 
D.  The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of entrapment. 
(Prior code § 16-25) 
9.08.110 - Duress. 
A.  It is an affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he or she was coerced to do so, by the use of, or threatened imminent use of, unlawful physical force upon him or her or a third person, which force or threatened force a person of reasonable firmness in his or her situation would have been unable to resist. 
B.  The defense of "duress" as defined in subsection A of this section is not available as to any offense when the defendant recklessly places himself or herself in a situation in which it is probable that he or she will be subjected to the force or threatened force described in subsection A of this section. 
(Prior code § 16-26) 
9.08.120 - Intoxicated or drugged condition. 
A.  A person who is in an intoxicated or drugged condition, whether from alcohol, drugs or other substance, is criminally responsible for conduct unless such condition is involuntarily produced and deprived him or her of the capacity to know or appreciate the nature, quality or wrongfulness of his or her conduct. 
B.  The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of intoxicated or drugged condition. 
C.  Evidence that a person was in a voluntary intoxicated or drugged condition may be admissible when otherwise relevant on issues of conduct but in no event shall it be admissible for the purpose of negating a mental state which is an element of the offense. In a trial by jury, the jury shall be so instructed when evidence that a person was in a voluntarily intoxicated or drugged condition has been received into evidence. 
(Ord. 7223 § 1, 2000: Prior code § 16-27) 
9.08.130 - Lack of responsibility because of mental disease or defect. 
    A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he or she did not know or appreciate the nature, quality or wrongfulness of his or her conduct or was incapable of conforming his or her conduct to the requirements of law.

Unless inconsistent with other provisions of this chapter defining justifiable use of physical force, or with some other provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute any offense is justifiable and not criminal when it is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a situation occasioned or developed through no fault of the actor, and which is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability of avoiding the injury outweighs the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the ordinance defining the offense charged. 
B.  The necessity and justifiability of conduct under subsection A of this section may not rest upon considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the ordinance, either in its general application or with respect to its application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder. Whenever evidence relating to the defense of justification under this section is offered, the court shall rule as a matter of law whether the claimed facts and circumstances would, if established, constitute a justification.

    "To tamper" means to interfere with something improperly, to meddle with it, displace it, make unwarranted alterations in its existing condition, or to deprive, temporarily, the owner or possessor of that thing.

B.  In any prosecution under of subsection (A)(3) of this section, proof that a meter or any other property of a utility has been tampered with, and the person accused received the use or direct benefit of the electric, gas, steam or water service, with one or more of the effects described in subsection (A)(3) of this section, shall be sufficient to support an inference which the trial court may submit to the trier of fact, from which the trier of fact may conclude that there has been a violation of such subdivision by the person who uses or receives the direct benefit of the electric, gas, steam or water service.

B.  All such wells in existence on the adoption date of this section shall be maintained so as to comply with all ordinances. 
(Prior code § 16-166)

Chapter 9.32 - THEFT AND RELATED OFFENSES 
Sections: 

9.32.010 - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    "Coercion" means a threat, however communicated: 
1.  To commit any crime; or 
2.  To inflict physical injury in the future on the person threatened or another; or

6.  To take or withhold action as a public servant, or to cause a public servant to take or withhold action; or 
7.  To inflict any other harm which would not benefit the actor. A threat of accusation, lawsuit or other invocation of official action is not coercion if the property sought to be obtained by virtue of such threat was honestly claimed as restitution or indemnification for harm done in the circumstances to which the accusation, exposure, lawsuit or other official action relates, or as compensation for property or lawful service. The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of justification as to any threat. 
    "Dealer" means a person in the business of buying and selling goods. 
    "Deceit" means purposely making a representation which is false and which the actor does not believe to be true and upon which the victim relies, as to a matter of fact, law, value, intention or other state of mind. The term "deceit" does not, however, include falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or puffing by statements unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed. Deception as to the actor's intention to perform a promise shall not be inferred from the fact alone that he did not subsequently perform the promise. 
    "Deprive" means: 
1.  To withhold property from the owner permanently; or 
2.  To restore property only upon payment of reward or other compensation; or

Wireless facilities shall not be permitted in the rights-of-way on new structures, provided that if evidence warranting an exception is provided by the applicant pursuant to Section 12.08.130(B), the city council may grant an exception authorizing a new structure for a wireless facility if it also determines on a non-discriminatory basis such proposed application is in the public interest in light of the purposes of this section and chapter, and provided such use and location has received prior, separate zoning authorization as required by and in compliance with Section 17.84.030, to the extent permitted by law.

Article III. - Fees and Compensation 

12.08.175 - User fees; payment method. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for recovery of all direct and indirect costs and expenses of the city related to enforcement and administration of this chapter as well as fair and reasonable compensation for the use of the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable law. 
B.  Rights-of-Way User Fees. 
1.  Unless otherwise provided by franchise, rights-of-way use agreement or applicable law, each occupant shall pay to the city as an annual compensation for the use of the public way a public ways user fee as follows: 
a.  Linear Foot Fee: Ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the first mile of linear utility facilities, or portion thereof, plus one dollar ninety-two cents ($1.92) per linear foot thereafter up to a maximum annual charge of forty eight thousand dollars ($48,000.00), or otherwise established by the council from time to time; and 
b.  Antenna Fee: A fee for each antenna in the ROW, if applicable to the user, in addition to any Linear Foot Fee, as reasonably established by the city. 
Provided that all occupants shall be entitled to a credit against the user fee due hereunder equal to the payment(s) from such occupant for the same time period for the business license or gross receipts tax paid by occupant; provided, however, such credit cannot exceed the amount due under this subsection and may not be carried forward or back to any other time period and a credit shall not apply to any taxes paid under protest or otherwise paid with qualification unless so required by law. 
2.  Bundled Services. Occupant expressly acknowledges and agrees that to the extent it markets bundled services, including combination of goods or services that may be subject to this article, it will fairly reflect to the city an appropriate and reasonable division of services among the various services offered based on the actual value of each separate service. Whether or not the occupant separates services on a subscriber's bill, it will provide to the city notice of any such allocation sufficient for city verification. Should the occupant engage in billing or payment practices that, in the reasonable determination of the city, do not fairly reflect a fair and appropriate allocation the city may nullify such allocation and require payment applicable to the full receipts. 
3.  Timing of Payment of User Fees. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, all rights-of-way user fees shall be due and payable on an annual basis in advance prior to commencement of occupancy, and thereafter on or before December 31 of each year for the following calendar year. 
4.  Interest of Late Payments and Under Payments. If any rights-of-way user fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest on the payment and interest on the unpaid balance shall accrue from the due date until received, at the rate of nine percent of the total amount past due or at such other rate as may be required by applicable law. 
5.  Fee Statement; Retroactive Adjustments. Each rights-of-way user fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the rights-of-way user fee was calculated. If any fee statement is determined to understate the fee owed, then such additional amount owed shall be made with a corrected statement, including interest on said amount as provided herein. Within ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the calendar year, each occupant shall submit a statement, certified as true, setting forth for the prior calendar year its gross revenues, the maximum amount of linear foot and antennas in the ROW existing in that period, and describing what revenues or receipts were included and excluded in the fee paid for the calendar year, and describing any required adjustments (additional payments or credits) arising from information not known and reflected as of the payment date. Any required additional payment shall be included with the report, any credit shall be deducted from the following annual payment. 
6.  No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any use fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any use fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city. 
7.  Maintain Records. Occupants shall at all times maintain complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership, and operations of the occupant with respect to the facilities in a manner that allows the city to determine whether the occupant has properly calculated its user fee in compliance with this article. Should the city reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such manner, the occupant shall correct the manner in which the books and/or records are maintained so that the occupant comes into compliance with this section. All financial books and records which are maintained in accordance with FCC regulations and the regulations of any governmental entity that regulates utilities in Missouri, and generally accepted accounting principles shall be deemed to be acceptable under this section. Such books and records shall be maintained for a period of at least three years. 
8.  Right of Inspection. The city or its designated representatives shall have the right to inspect, examine, or audit, during normal business hours and upon seven calendar day notice, all documents, records, or other information that pertains to the facilities within the rights-of-way and/or occupant's user fee obligations. In addition to access to the records of occupant for audits, upon request, occupant shall provide reasonable access to records necessary to verify compliance with the terms of this article. 
C.  Supplemental to Applicable Taxes. The city may, in its sole and absolute discretion, grant rights to use city property or city facilities. If the right is granted, by lease, license, rights-of-way use agreement, franchise or other manner, to use and occupy city property for the installation of facilities, the compensation to be paid shall be fixed by the city. Unless otherwise provided, use or installation of any facilities in, on, or over non-rights-of-way public property of the city, or on city facilities shall be permitted only if a lease agreement, or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city council with such reasonable terms as the council may require, in accordance with this article. Such agreements shall convey no property interest in the city property or city facilities to the applicant. 
D.  Fees and Compensation Not a Tax. The fees and costs provided for in this article, and any compensation charged and paid for the use of the rights-of-way as provided for in this article, are separate from, and additional to, any and all federal, state, city or other local taxes as may be levied, imposed or due.

Rev. Stat. Chapter 537.610, applicable to political subdivisions. The policies of insurance shall be in such form and shall be issued be such company or companies as may be satisfactory to the city. The city, and such additional persons and entities as may be deemed to have an exposure to liability as a result of the performance of the excavation work, as determined by the city, shall be named as additional insured with duty of defense on all insurance policies required hereunder. The insurance requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to an entity to the extent and for such period during an agreement, franchise or permit issued hereunder if such entity is exempted from such requirements pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 67.1830(6)(a) and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that the entity has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and is otherwise therefore so exempted unless otherwise provided by agreement or franchise. The city reserves the right to waive any and all requirements under this section when deemed to be in the public interest. 
    All other provisions of Sections 12.08.210 and 12.08.220 shall remain in full force and effect. 
B.  Such insurance policy shall contain provisions to indemnify, save harmless and defend the city and its officers and employees against any claim or loss, damage or expense sustained on account of damages to persons or property occurring by reason of a excavation made by the permittee, his or her subcontractor or agent. 
C.  Such insurance policy shall indemnify, save harmless and defend the city from any and all liability for the city's own negligence occurring by reason of said opening or excavation. This indemnification agreement covering the city's liability for its own negligence shall not apply to injuries or damages sustained while the city employees are present at the excavation pouring cement or asphalt therein. 
D.  The permittee assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades and/or lights as required from the time of the opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel.

(Prior code § 27-61) 
12.08.260 - Completion of construction/excavation. 
A.  Completion of Construction. The permittee shall promptly complete all work authorized by a permit so as to minimize disruption of the city rights-of-way and other public and private property. All work within city rights-of-way, including restoration, must be completed within one hundred (100) days of the date of issuance of the permit unless extended or modified by the director. 
B.  Regulations for Refilling Excavations. The refilling of all cuts and excavations made in any street, sidewalk, alley or public place in the city shall be done in the following manner: 
1.  Backfilling. 
a.  All excavations and street openings shall be backfilled with suitable graded aggregate or nonshrink slurry. When backfilling, compaction shall be by mechanical means in not more than twelve (12) inch lifts to a point eight inches below finished surface or as directed below for the proper type of surface material. 
b.  When backfilling under bituminous pavement or concrete pavement, the trench shall be backfilled to a density of ninety-five (95) percent of maximum density as determined by the American Society For Testing & Materials (ASTM) Designation D-698. In areas containing unstable material, the compaction shall be equal to the density of the adjacent material as determined by the ASTM. 
c.  If a nonshrink slurry is used for backfilling, the design mix shall be two thousand six hundred (2,600) pounds of well-graded .375 minus aggregate, eight hundred (800) pounds of mortar sand, ninety-four (94) pounds of Portland cement and eleven (11) gallons of water. This nonshrink slurry may be placed directly against nonmetallic surfaces; however, metallic surfaces should be protected with water works enamel, a polyvinyl sleeve or a bedding of twelve (12) inches of suitable graded aggregate. A nonshrink slurry backfill shall be brought up to a point eight inches below finished surface or as specified in subsection (B)(2)(b) or (B)(2)(c). 
d.  The enforcement agency may limit the length of excavation to be opened at one time, owing to the nature of the soil and other attending circumstances.

a.  Surface material shall be saw cut and removed six inches beyond the trench line to ensure an undisturbed shoulder for new surfacing. 
b.  In replacing concrete material, the fill shall be brought to a minimum of eight inches to the finished surface or to match the existing thickness, whichever is greater. If the concrete removed was reinforced, then the patch shall also be reinforced in such a way as to tie the new reinforcing into the existing. All concrete shall be three thousand (3,000) pounds with six by six to ten (10) by ten (10) mesh and all surfaces shall have a groom finish and be protected from the elements until properly set. 
c.  In replacing asphalt material, the fill shall be brought to a minimum of ten (10) inches to the finished surface, then apply seven inches of asphaltic concrete base, then one and one-half inches of asphaltic concrete binder and one and one-half inches of asphaltic concrete surface. The finished surface shall be rolled with a smooth-wheeled roller weighting not less than five tons. 
d.  In replacing soil, eight inches of clean, unfrozen earth shall be placed and compacted. 
e.  The enforcement agency may require each excavation to be sealed with a slurry seal or an approved equal, or in the case of extensive excavations, may require any portion of the affected street to be selected. 
3.  In the event of failure to refill said excavation, the director shall have the right to make any and all refills and to require reimbursement of the cost thereof from the person making the excavation, with payment for such cost to be made in the manner prescribed in Section 12.08.260(G) for payment of charges for repaving and resurfacing. However, the person making the excavation has the sole responsibility to see that the excavation is properly barricaded with barricades and/or lights as required by Section 12.08.250(A). 
4.  The person making such refill shall be required to clean up and haul away all surplus earth, rock or rubbish immediately after such refill is completed, unless special permission has been granted in writing by the director or his or her representative. The person making the backfill shall give the enforcement agency a minimum four hours' notice prior to beginning backfill. In case of default thereof, the enforcement agency shall have the right to remove such earth, rock or rubbish and charge the cost of such removal against the deposit of the person to whom the permit was issued. 
5.  In the event of settlement due to defective refill, occurring within a two-year period after the completion of repaving, the enforcement agency shall have the right to make whatever repairs are required to restore the excavation and repaving to a proper condition and to charge the cost thereof against the deposit of the person to whom the permit was issued. 
6.  All moneys collected in accordance with this section shall be remitted to the city treasurer to be placed to the credit of the general fund. 
C.  As-Built Drawings. Within sixty (60) days after completion unless such time is extended or modified by the director, the permittee shall furnish the city with one complete set of plans, drawn to scale and certified to the city as accurately depicting the location of all utility facilities constructed pursuant to the permit. This requirement may be waived by the director. 
D.  Restoration of Structures and Facilities. Upon completion of any excavation work, the permittee shall promptly repair any and all public and private property improvements, fixtures, structures, and facilities in the rights-of-way or otherwise damaged during the course of construction, restoring the same as practicable to its condition before the start of construction. 
E.  Landscape Restoration. 
1.  All trees, landscaping and grounds removed, damaged or disturbed as a result of the excavation, construction, installation, maintenance, repair or replacement of utility facilities, whether such work is done pursuant to a franchise, license, right-of-way use agreement and/or permit; must be replaced or restored as nearly as may be practicable to the condition existing prior to performance of work; 
2.  All restoration work within the rights-of-way shall be done in accordance with landscape plans approved by the director. 
F.  Failure to Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by this chapter, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the performance bond. (See Section 12.08.210, Surety bond.) 
G.  Payment of Charges for Repaving and Resurfacing. 
1.  If any charge so made by the city remains unpaid after the tenth day of the following month, no further permits for any excavation shall be issued to any such person until such charge has been paid, and provided further that if any such charges so made are not paid within the time above-mentioned, the amount due to the city therefor shall be taken out of the deposit provided for in Section 12.08.210(A) and no further permits shall be issued to any such person until such deposit shall again be brought up to one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
2.  All payments of charges provided for in this section shall be remitted to the city treasurer to be placed to the credit of the general fund.

A.  Every railroad corporation shall construct and maintain good and sufficient crossings where its railroad crosses public roads now or hereafter to be opened for public use, which crossing shall be constructed of material and in the manner following: 
1.  Every crossing shall be constructed of materials that will provide a ride quality compatible with that of adjacent roadway surfaces; except that crossings of unconsolidated or asphalt material shall have installed headers of equal height to the top of rails installed on both sides of both rails. 
2.  The crossing on paved roads shall be the same width as the approaching roadway, including drivable shoulders plus two feet on each side. On gravel roads, the crossing shall be the same width as the traveled way, but not less than sixteen (16) feet. 
3.  The railroad corporation shall maintain the road surface from end of ties to end of ties and between tracks where adjacent track centers are less than fifteen (15) feet. 
4.  When a railroad corporation makes a track raise within a grade crossing, the runoff along the roadway shall be maintained at not more than two inches in the first ten (10) feet outside the end of ties, not more than six inches in the next ten (10) feet, and the remaining runoff shall be brought to the same level as the existing grade within an additional ten (10) feet along the roadway. 
5.  The railroad shall maintain a crosswalk of equal width as the approaching sidewalk from the end of ties to the end of ties and between tracks where adjacent track centers are less than fifteen (15) feet apart. The railroad shall use a durable contrasting material between the ends of ties when the approaching sidewalk is constructed of a hard surface material. Any durable material compatible with the material used on the sidewalk may be used on the crosswalk between the adjacent tracks. 
6.  The roadway surface shall be in the same plane as the top of rails for a distance of two feet outside of rails for either multiple or single track crossings. The top of the rail plane shall be connected with the grade line of the roadway each way by vertical curves of the length required to provide riding conditions and sight distances normally applied to the roadway. The roadway surface shall not be more than three inches higher nor six inches lower than the top of the nearest rail at a point thirty (30) feet from the rail, measured at a right angle, unless track super-elevation dictates otherwise. Where crossings involve two or more tracks, the top of rails for all tracks shall be brought to the same plane where practicable. 
7.  Width of roadway at a street-railway grade crossing should correspond to that of the adjoining street and have the same number and width of traffic lanes as the adjoining street, without extra lanes and with center turn lanes at the crossing delineated. At all paved approaches to the street-railway grade crossing, the street traffic lanes in the vicinity of the crossing shall be distinctly marked in accordance with the recommendations of the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways." 
8.  The crossing surface for all new or reconstructed track where the railroad crosses public roads shall be molded rubber panels with steel re-enforcement and a patterned surface. 
9.  Where the grade of the street approach descends toward the crossing, provisions shall be made to intercept surface and subsurface drainage and discharge it laterally so that it will not be discharged on the track area. 
10.  The ballast and subballast shall be dug out a minimum of ten (10) inches below the bottoms of the ties, one foot minimum beyond the ends of the ties and beyond the end of the crossing a minimum of twenty (20) feet, and reballasted with ballast to conform with American Railway Engineering Association specifications. A minimum of at least ten (10) inches of clean ballast should be placed between bottom of tie and the subballast or subgrade. 
11.  Treated No. 5 hardwood or concrete ties shall be used through the limits of the crossing and beyond the crossing a minimum of twenty (20) feet. Length and spacing of ties should conform to the type of grade crossing surface materials being used. 
12.  The rails throughout the crossing shall be so laid to eliminate joints within the crossing. The nearest joint shall not be less than twenty (20) feet from the end of the crossing. Where necessary, long rails shall be used or the rail ends shall be welded to form continuous rail through the crossing. Rails shall be spiked to line, and the track shall be thoroughly and solidly tamped to uniform surface. Rails shall be protected with rust inhibitor. The rail section should, at a minimum, be one hundred fifteen (115) pound welded rail throughout the crossing to at least twenty (20) feet beyond each end of crossing. 
13.  Flangeways not less than two and one-half or more than three inches width shall be provided. Flangeways shall be at least two inches in depth unless approved by the operating railroad. 
14.  An agreed upon profile, and highway, shall be established between the operating railroad and the public works department. 
15.  Subgrade shall be cleaned of all old contaminated ballast and bladed to a level surface a minimum of ten (10) inches below bottom of tie and at least twenty (20) feet beyond each end of the crossing. 
16.  All drainage areas should be cleaned and sloped away from the crossing both directions along the track and the roadway. 
17.  When practical, a geotextile fabric should be used between the subgrade and the ballast section and at least twenty (20) feet beyond each end of the crossing, and if a rail joint falls within these limits at least five feet beyond the rail joint. If practical, the geotextile fabric should extend under the roadway surface, traveled way, fifteen (15) feet each way from center line of track. 
18.  All ties through the crossing area and at least twenty (20) feet beyond each end of the crossing should be fully tie plated with four spikes per tie plate, and fully box anchored. Optional placement of the tie pads is acceptable. 
19.  Rails should be spiked to line, and the track machined or mechanically tamped and surfaced to grade and alignment of the existing track and roadway. 
B.  When existing crossings have deteriorated to a level of service requiring reconstruction, the reconstruction shall be accomplished in accordance with the requirements for new construction. 
C.  If such corporation fails to construct or maintain such crossings as above provided, then the city shall notify such corporation of the necessity of the construction thereof, which notice or petition shall be in writing and shall be served by delivering a copy of the notice or petition to the agent of the corporation most convenient to the crossing. Upon the service of such notice or petition, if such corporation fails to construct such crossing within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice or petition, the city may proceed to construct and open the crossing as herein provided, and shall be entitled to recover double the amount expended, together with all costs, in the name of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction, from such corporation refusing to construct the same. Such corporation shall also be liable for all damages resulting from such neglect to construct such crossing; said damages to be recovered in the name of the party injured, in any court of competent jurisdiction.

A.  Applications for water service shall be made at city hall by or on behalf of the customer requesting water service. The application shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by the department. Every customer using water from the waterworks system shall be deemed to have consented and agreed to the terms and provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Permits are of three kinds, defined as follows: 
1.  Service permits are required where taps are to be made and new services are to be installed; 
2.  Extension permits are required where an existing service, whether on public or private property, is to be altered, extended, repaired or renewed from the main to the building, or fixtures or appurtenances added thereto or detached from, and when service is disconnected and abandoned at the mains; 
3.  Renewal permits are required where an existing service or services are to be abandoned and replaced with a single larger service that requires a larger tap, or the relocation of any existing service that requires a new tap. 
C.  No work in connection with the tappings of any main or the introduction of water into any premises (public or private) shall be done, nor shall any water service be altered, repaired or extended without prior issuance of a permit authorizing the performance of such work. When the plumber must perform emergency work during other than normal working hours, the water division shall be notified by telephone prior to the starting of such work, and the plumber shall secure the permit on the next regular working day. See Section 13.04.070(C) for inspection to be performed during other than normal working hours. 
D.  A master plumber's or journeyman plumber's license is not transferable. Any master plumber shall subject himself or herself to suspension if he or she attempts to, or procures a water permit for the benefit of anyone other than himself or herself.

A permit for fire protection service will not be issued without evidence of a water service line for domestic use. Permits are issued subject to a city water main being in front of the property to be served. If the property is large enough to permit a subdividing at a later date, it will be necessary for the water main to front the subdivided property on which the facility to be served is constructed. Failure of the applicant to pay a bill for service rendered by the water division shall be a basis for denial of further permits until such bill or bills be paid. Persistent violation of this provision may be considered cause for revoking the master plumber's license held by the offender.

13.04.030 - Water mains. 
A.  Water mains are classified functionally as feeder mains, distribution mains, and service mains. A further classification into city mains and private mains is also made. These mains are further described as follows: 
1.  A feeder main is a water conduit that is used for transportation of water from one part of the water system to a more remote part or reservoir and coming from pump stations. These mains are usually sixteen (16) inches in diameter and smaller; 
2.  A distribution main is a water conduit that is connected between and from feeder mains and is the principal means of supply for localities. These mains are usually eight to twelve (12) inches in diameter and no less than eight inches in diameter for all pipe laid after January 1, 1978; 
3.  A service main is a conduit that supplies water directly to a customer through a service connection. These shall be mains smaller than twelve (12) inches in diameter. Twelve (12) inch mains may be classed either service mains or distribution mains as deemed appropriate by the water division of the public works department. 
B.  Private water mains will not be allowed connection to the city's system except as a provision between the water division and applicant. Those private mains presently connected to the water division system and in contract with water division mains shall be subject to the regulations hereinafter set forth. 
C.  Connections to water mains shall be made as provided in these rules and regulations. The owner of private water mains, where that owner is not a public utility, must allow new customers to make a service connection to or extend from it for their own purposes. The owner is permitted to charge a fee for this connection, and in the event of disagreement as to the amount of the fee, the public works department shall act as arbiter and will fix a price that will be binding on both parties. All applications for permits to connect to a private water main must be accompanied by a letter from the owner which states specifically that the owner approves the connection. 
D.  When a new water division main is laid paralleling an obsolete existing main, connection between the water division's new main and existing individual tap services will be made at the city's expense, and the obsolete main will be abandoned. Where such obsolete main is a private main, the cost of transferring services will be charged as ordered by the public works department. 
E.  Operation of mains shall be performed only by the water division personnel. Requests by the plumbers for the shutting down of mains shall be made a reasonable time in advance, and shutdown will be performed during regular working hours unless request stipulates otherwise. When shutdowns are made for the benefit of the person making the request, he or she will be charged for this service on the basis of prevailing labor and equipment rates. 
F.  The responsibility for maintenance of mains shall be with the owner of the main. In event of failure of a private main where such failure constitutes a menace to public health and safety or excessive loss of water, the water division of the public works department will repair the main and the owner shall bear the cost. Otherwise, the owner will be notified, and he or she may elect to have either the water division or his or her contractor repair the main at his or her own expense. 
G.  All service mains serving residential homes (single dwelling) will be maintained as stated. A service line from distribution main to meter pit including lid, cover, meter, yoke, ell, valve, meter pit, service line tap, piping and fittings will be maintained, serviced, repaired, replaced, removed and relocated at the sole expense of the water division of the public works department. All other piping, fitting and valves will be the responsibility of the property owner, from the house side of the meter pit to the house. 
H.  All service mains serving commercial, factory or industrial areas shall be maintained, repaired and replaced, removed, resized and kept up to the division's standards at all times by the property owner or building owner. Service mains serving commercial, factory or industrial services are as follows: 
1.  Everything connected from distribution mains including corporation cocks or sleeves, valves, piping, meter, meter pits, meter settings and bypass lines, and piping in meter pits and entire service into the building or property; 
2.  The water division of the public works department will at no time be held responsible to maintain commercial, factory or industrial service main except as stated in Section 13.04.030(F); 
3.  The water division of the public works department reserves the right to do the work or reject the work upon the request of such work. The public works department will act as arbiter in cases of question as to what is termed residential, commercial, factory and industrial. 
(Ord. 7913 § 1 (part), 2004) 
13.04.040 - Water services. 
A.  Water service piping is classified into two categories: Tap service piping and branch service piping. The components of tap service piping are a corporation stop, copper pipe, a curb stop and box, meter yoke and meter stop valve. The components of a branch service piping are a tapping sleeve and valve, a valve box, pipe, meter stop valves and bypass piping. Branch service piping may be for domestic water service or private fire protection service. When branch service piping is used for private fire protection, the service size must be designed by an engineer. It may not be tapped for domestic service unless otherwise approved by the water division. 
B.  All service lines shall conform to the following requirements: 
1.  Service connections are to be made in front of the property to be served unless otherwise approved by the water division; 
2.  Service lines are to be run perpendicular to the main from the main to the curb box or, in the absence of a curb box, to the property line; 
3.  Service lines shall be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed drain or sewer line. Should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of ten (10) feet, a water service line may be laid closer than ten (10) feet to a storm or sanitary sewer line, provided that the service line is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located on one side of the sewer line and at such an elevation that the bottom of the service line is at least eighteen (18) inches above the top of the sewer line. When it is impossible to obtain vertical or horizontal separation, the sewer line must be re-laid and constructed with ductile iron or copper with flare or mechanical compression fittings, and shall be pressure-tested to assure water tightness before backfilling unless otherwise approved by the water division; 
4.  Where service lines must cross over sewers, storm drains, or sanitary sewers, the service line must be laid at such an elevation that the bottom of the service line is at least eighteen (18) inches above the top of the sewer. This vertical separation must be maintained for that portion of the service line located within ten (10) feet horizontally of any sewer or sewer line that it crosses. Said ten (10) feet to be measured as the normal distance from the service line to the sewer unless otherwise approved by the water division; 
5.  Service lines shall have a cover of not less than four feet nor more than five feet, unless obstructions require deeper excavation for clearance; 
6.  No service line shall be less than three-quarter inches in diameter; 
7.  A backflow preventor valve is required on all irrigation systems or other lines constituting a cross connection to the public water supply in buildings already built and not disconnected. Cross connections are not allowed in any building being built or repaired, and must be removed, and building piping worked to specifications. (See Ordinance 5840) 
C.  All tap service lines shall conform to the following requirements: 
1.  All tap service piping shall conform to the latest American Public Works Association (APWA) specifications for type K flexible copper tubing or to the latest American Water Works Association (AWWA) specification C901 for high-density polyethylene (HDPE). HDPE service lines shall be a minimum of SIDR9 with a pressure rating of one hundred sixty (160) psi. 
2.  The connection of the tap service line to the corporation shall be by means of a flared fitting, or approved compression fitting;

Such applications shall be submitted to the director one hundred twenty (120) days prior to any proposed discharge. 
C.  Any significant industrial user, which significantly alters or adds to its operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character shall apply for and shall obtain a new permit prior to making the alteration. Such application shall be submitted to the director sixty (60) days prior to any alteration in discharge. This sixty (60) day notice may be waived by the director for alterations which reduce the total quantity of wastewater or pollutants discharge. 
D.  Any existing industrial user which becomes a significant industrial user due to any increase or change in the industrial user's contribution of pollutants to the POTW or due to the enactment or revision of this article or promulgation or revision of a categorical standard shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of this article or within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date it becomes a significant industrial user, whichever is later. 
E.  Any violation of wastewater discharge permit requirements or conditions shall be a violation of this article. Compliance with a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with this article, with all applicable federal and state or local statutes or regulations. 
F.  No significant industrial user shall: 
1.  Discharge anything into the POTW without having first obtained a valid wastewater discharge permit; or 
2.  Discharge anything into the POTW in excess of or in contravention of the provisions of its wastewater discharge permit; or 
3.  Discharge anything into the POTW when its wastewater discharge permit has been suspended, revoked or has expired, (unless the SIU has submitted a permit application in a timely manner and the city has failed to issue a new permit, than the SIU can continue to discharge under their old permit until a new permit is issued). 
G.  Any existing facility which has complied with subsection C of this section shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection F of this section pending the director's decision on the issuance of a permit. 
H.  Upon finding that an industrial user, who is not subject to categorical pretreatment standards but otherwise meets the criteria for being a significant industrial user has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard, the director may at any time determine that such industrial user is not a significant industrial user.

If it is found that the building or structure is a public nuisance, further findings shall be made as to whether or not the procedures required by this article have been substantially met and complied with, and whether or not the abatement order of the inspector of dangerous buildings to abate the nuisance was reasonable in its terms and conditions and within the standards of this article.

(Ord. No. 9099, § 3, 8-7-2018) 
15.24.190 - Order of abatement. 
    If a proceeding is not dismissed following the findings required by Section 15.24.180, the building official shall issue an order of abatement directing the building or structure to be completed, secured, boarded, repaired or demolished, and vacated as the case may be, within the standards of this article. This order, together with the findings of fact and conclusions of law required by Section 15.24.180, shall be in writing and shall be immediately delivered or mailed to each party to the hearing or to his attorney of record. In addition, copies of the order and findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the office of the building official for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance thereof. The order shall state a reasonable time, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date of issuance, within which to comply with the order, and shall further provide that if it is not complied with within such time, the building official may, in his discretion, cause the work to be done by the city and its own crews or by contractors employed by the city for that purpose, or the city may enter into contracts with persons engaged in the business of repairing, securing, boarding or demolishing buildings for the purpose of enforcing the order provided for in this section provided there are unencumbered funds in the city budget for that purpose. 
    In the alternative, upon the failure of the owner to comply with the order of abatement directing completion, securing, boarding, repair, demolition or other means of abatement of the building or structure as required, or upon the finding of the building official that the building is a public nuisance under Section 15.24.110 hereof, the building official may request that the city council exercise its authority of eminent domain under Article VI, Section 21 of the Constitution of the State of Missouri by declaring a public necessity for the taking of the property as blighted, substandard or unsanitary and directing the city counselor to commence proceedings to obtain ownership of the building or structure, and the property upon which it is located, by condemnation. If the city acquires title to the property by eminent domain, the building official shall therefore abate the nuisance on behalf of the city by repair, demolition or other appropriate action.

15.44.030 - Sign categories and types. 
    The following sign types are distinguished for the purposes of the sign allowances in this chapter. Where any particular sign application involves a sign type that does not clearly fall within any single category, or could fall within more than one category, the code official shall interpret the particular application based on the most similar sign type, with consideration given to the purposes of this chapter. 
TABLE 15-1: SIGN TYPES TYPE DESCRIPTION Wall Sign A sign painted, printed or attached to the exterior surface of a building, awning, canopy or other fixed surface in a permanent manner with a scale and design legible to vehicles in the roadway or pedestrians at a distance from the building. Window Sign A sign hanging in, painted on, or otherwise affixed on a window in a permanent manner with messages visible from the outside of the building but designed and located in a manner that permits views through the window to the interior of the building. Roof Signs Any sign mounted or extending above the cornice line of a flat roof building, or above the eave of any pitched roof building, with a scale and design legible to vehicles in the roadway or pedestrians at a distance from the building. Ground Signs Any sign that is mounted to the ground independent from any building with a scale and design legible to vehicles in the roadway or pedestrians at a distance from the building or site. Free-standing signs encompass two specific sign types:   Monument Sign: A type of free-standing sign where the entire bottom of the sign is mounted on the ground or ornamental surface structure, and where the surface area of the structure does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the sign area of the sign mounted upon it.   Pole Sign: A type of free-standing sign constructed on one or more columns, poles or similar structures so the bottom edge of the sign surface is elevated above the ground. Reader Board/Drive-through A sign designed in conjunction with drive-in services to give information relative to the business where it is located, and which information may change frequently. Pedestrian Signs A sign with a design and scale to be legible to pedestrians in front of or immediately adjacent to the building or site or to be legible to individuals internal to a site. Pedestrian signs may be located in a permanent manner on the valance of awnings, hanging below a canopy or awning, projecting from a wall, mounted on a wall or window, or free-standing. Directional Sign A sign aimed at communicating messages to vehicles entering a site, or internal to a site. Off-Premise Commercial Sign A sign or sign structure with a commercial message for an establishment, merchandise, service, or entertainment which is not located, sold, produced, manufactured or furnished at the location on which the sign is located. Person Sign A temporary sign held by or attached to a person. Portable Reader Board A freestanding sign secured to a portable base or frame, designed to be legible to pedestrians.

15.44.040 - Interpretation of dimensional standards. 
    The following shall be used in interpreting dimensional standards in this chapter for signs: 
A.  General Area Calculation. Signs mounted on a standard geometric shape, such as a triangle, circle, or rectangle, shall be measured by the standard mathematical formula for that shape. Signs mounted on an irregular shape shall be measured by the smallest area of a collection of standard geometric shapes (circle, triangle or rectangle) that can encompass the entire area of the irregular shape. No more than three geometric shapes may be used. (See Figure 15-2.) 
Figure 15-2: Standard sign measurements and measurements of signs mounted on irregular shapes. 

B.  Free-Standing Signs. The area of the free-standing or other ground-mounted signs shall be computed by the entire area of the face of the structure, cabinet or module enclosed by the border of the frame. 
C.  Wall or Window Signs. The area of wall, window or other building-mounted signs shall be computed by means of the smallest continuous perimeter figure which encloses the outer limits of the writing, emblem or other display, using no more than three standard geometric shapes. Gaps in writing, emblems or other display which are more than two times the width of the tallest element of the sign area, and which do not otherwise alter the surface upon which the sign is mounted, may be subtracted from the calculation of the sign area. Where these gaps are excluded from the sign area, each area shall be interpreted as a separate sign for the purpose of any sign quantity limitations. (See Figure 15-3.) 
Figure 15-3: Where the gap in portions of the sign is larger than two (2) times the height, it shall be counted as two (2) separate signs for any sign quantity limitations that may apply. 

D.  Decorative Elements. Decorative embellishments such as pole covers, supporting framework, roofing and support structures which are included to enhance the aesthetics and improve the architectural compatibility of the sign with the site and building may be excluded from the area calculation if they contain no writing, emblem or other display. 
E.  Double-Faced Signs. In computing area of a double-faced sign, the area of the largest side shall be considered the total area of the sign. However, if any interior angle formed by the faces of the multi-faced sign, or other volume of the sign structure results in any portion of the sign faces being separated by more than three feet, then all sides of the sign shall be considered in calculating the sign area. (See Figure 15-4.) 
Figure 15-4: When the opposite faces or any portion of a sign is separated by less than three feet, it is considered one sign and only the area of one sign face is counted towards the total area. When that separation is more than three feet, each sign face shall count towards the area. 

F.  Height. Sign height is measured from the lowest point of the ground directly below the sign to the highest point on the sign or sign structure. 
G.  3-Dimensional Signs. 3-dimensional sign area is measured as the profile of the object using the formula in subsection A times the depth using the rule in subsection E that each three feet of depth constitutes a new sign face with the area of the profile. For example, a 3-dimensional sign with a profile area of A and a depth of eight feet would have a total sign area of 3 × A. 
Figure 15-5: 3-D signs are measured by using the area formula for a profile of the object and then multiplying it by one for each three-foot increment of depth for the object.

Chapter 15.48 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[12] 
Sections: 
Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 8788, § 1, adopted Dec. 2, 2014, repealed former Ch. 15.48, §§ 15.48.010-15.48.120, and enacted a new Ch. 15.48 as set out herein. The former chapter pertained to similar subject matter. For prior history, see Code Comparative Table. 

Article I. - Statutory Authority, Findings of Fact, and Purposes 

15.48.010 - Statutory authority. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in R.S.Mo. § 77.260, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 8788, § 2, 12-2-2014) 
15.48.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of North Kansas City, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  General Causes of the Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
C.  Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter use standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
1.  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this section is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this section. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Clay County dated August 3, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
2.  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
3.  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
4.  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
5.  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 8788, § 2, 12-2-2014; Ord. No. 8841, § 1, 6-16-2015) 
15.48.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 15.48.020(A); to establish or maintain the city's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
C.  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

15.48.175 - Areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in Section 15.48.050 are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply: 
1.  AO Zones . 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

15.48.180 - Floodway. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.48.050 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
A.  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. 
B.  The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If subsection (B) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V. 
D.  In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in Section 15.48.150(B).

(Ord. No. 8788, § 2, 12-2-2014) 
15.48.230 - Floodplain management variance criteria. 
    In passing upon such applications for variances, the board of zoning adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria: 
1.  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
2.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
(Ord. No. 8788, § 2, 12-2-2014) 
15.48.240 - Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (B) through (F) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 8788, § 2, 12-2-2014) 
15.48.250 - Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures. 
    Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Sections 15.48.230 and 15.48.240 of this chapter. 
    In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.

If any new facilities, or improvements to existing facilities are needed, the subdivider shall prepare and submit to the director any or all of the following as may apply to the proposed subdivision according to the latest edition of APWA standards for the Kansas City region: preliminary plans and profiles of public streets, sanitary sewers, preliminary storm water plans, and a preliminary water supply and distribution plan. 
2.  Upsizing. Wherever any portion of the required infrastructure improvements are part of a planned future city improvement the city may require that the applicant enter into an agreement to build the facility to its planned size or capacity. The city and the applicant shall negotiate an agreement to share the cost of the additional construction, with the applicant responsible for all costs that would otherwise be paid in building the facility to serve the specific application absent any upsizing, and with the city responsible for any actual costs due to incremental upsizing of the facility. 
C.  Utility Review. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, or before approval of any final plat, at minimum, utility easements will be shown on the final plat according to the design standards of this title.

Illustration #6
3.  (South only) Light industrial or flex buildings may have a first story up to fifty (50) feet provided that the building frontage includes a lobby, office or show room that otherwise meets the height standards to a depth of at least thirty (30) feet from the Front Building Line. ( Illustration #6 ) 
C.  Entrance feature (Illustration #7). 

Illustration #7
1.  All buildings shall have a primary entrance directly connecting to the Burlington Streetscape: 
a.  One (1) for every one hundred fifty (150) feet of building frontage (North). 
b.  One (1) for every seventy-five (75) feet of building frontage (Central).

a.  Twenty-five percent (25%) to seventy percent (70%) for all buildings except light industrial buildings. 
b.  No requirement for light industrial buildings, except that the front façades of these buildings shall meet this requirement with architectural ornamentation specified in the Design Guidelines. 

Illustration #8

Illustration #9
E.  Other. 
1.  Permitted projections: Awnings, balconies, eaves or other projections associated with the design of the building may project up to five (5) feet in front of the Front Building Line, provided a minimum eight-foot clearance above the sidewalk is maintained. 
2.  Any building with less than eighty-five percent (85%) frontage at the front building line shall use the same materials and design styles on the side façades. Any building with less than seventy percent (70%) frontage at the front building line, or which has any portion of a building and site that backs onto a public street, shall use the same materials and design styles on the side and rear façades. 
3.  All buildings shall be designed according to the Design Guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 8508, § 1, 12-14-2010) 
17.66.070 - Design guidelines. 
    These design guidelines are consistent with the vision and principles of the Burlington Corridor Study. They may be used to help interpret the site and building standards of the district. They must be used when considering any conditional approvals or exceptions to the standards. 

Illustration #10
A.  Building form and design. The outer form and design of a building establishes the scale of public spaces and shape the public streetscape. Façade designs with greater "permeability" can support a more active and interesting streetscape. 
1.  Frontage design: ( Illustration #10 ) 
a.  All buildings shall be placed on the lot to shape positive public space in the Burlington Corridor, including planned and anticipated streetscape arrangements. Consult the Street Design concepts in the Burlington Corridor Study for potential street sections on particular segments of the corridor. 
b.  Buildings constructed at the "build to" should form a more consistent street wall along Burlington. 
c.  Rehabilitation of existing buildings should aim to bring sites more in conformance with the setbacks and orientation concepts in the Corridor Study. 
d.  Where portions of a lot are not fronted by building façades, such as an open space or parking area, the disruption in the street wall should be minimized to the greatest extent practical by a continuation of the substitute street wall extended from the façade. Examples of substitute street walls include small "courtyard walls" constructed of the same material as the principal building, ornamental fencing, or year-round evergreen landscape materials forming a vertical wall-like element. 
2.  Height and massing: 
Illustration #11

a.  The height of buildings should establish a ratio of building height to distance between street walls on opposite sides of the block between 1:1 or 1:3 ( Illustration #11 ), with the ideal goal being a 1:2 ( Illustration #12 ) relationship. This will typically require between 2-story and 4-story buildings. Where larger heights are permitted, upper portions of buildings should step back to maintain these proportions. ( Illustration #13 ) 
b.  Building heights should be consistent along a single block face. Minor deviations in building heights between five percent (5%) to fifteen percent (15%) along a single block face are acceptable to add depth and texture to the street wall. ( Illustration #14 ) 
c.  Significant deviations in height are acceptable at limited locations on a block provided they are at key intersections to emphasize a focal point within the streetscape. 
d.  Larger buildings of four (4) or more stories or occupying more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the block face should use more complex massing to break up the form of the building and create a more pedestrian scale. 
e.  Such complex massing should still maintain a consistent street wall at the front building line. Deviations of more than two (2) feet along a front façade at street level should only be permitted to shape positive and useable outdoor space which improves the relationship and transitions between the streetscape and activities within the building. 
3.  Orientation: 

Illustration #15
a.  All buildings should have its primary façade and primary entrance oriented towards the street. 
b.  Pedestrian activity should be directed towards Burlington. 
c.  Vehicle activity should be directed towards side streets and rear alley systems, or limited in extent when it is necessary for them to be oriented towards Burlington. 
d.  For retail use, building entrances should be located more frequently along the streetscape to generate more activity and complimentary pedestrian traffic for nearby uses. 
e.  Areas of the façade immediately associated with the entrance should be reserved for the most ornamental or dynamic elements of the building design. 
f.  Entrance features should be designed at a pedestrian scale - primarily single story and no wider than the smallest architectural bay of the building. ( Illustration # 15 & 17 ) 
4.  Articulation/Modulation: ( Illustration #15 ). 

Illustration #16
a.  Façades that extend more than one hundred (100) feet along the block face should be broken down into architectural bays. Bays should be a consistent dimension on any single building. They may be formed by gangs of windows, groupings of architectural ornamentation, or pilasters associated with structural and massing elements of a building. ( Illustration #16 ) 
  
b.  Retail uses should use architectural bays of twenty-five (25) feet to fifty (50) feet that coordinate with differentiated storefronts on the street level. 

Illustration #17
c.  Expansive areas of blank façades on Burlington should be broken up by windows, building entrances, or ornamental features. No more than thirty (30) feet of horizontal blank wall space should exist along Burlington without creating greater transparency and articulation through a combination of these elements. 
5.  Transparency: 
a.  Street level façades for retail areas should include significant proportions of transparent display windows. No window starting at a level of greater than three and one-half (3.5) feet above the street level should be included in the calculation. 
b.  Where the internal operations of the use are such that there is no practical way for the transparency guidelines to be met, a limited alternate of boxed display windows or enhanced building ornamentation may be used. Boxed display windows should meet all other transparency guidelines, but may be closed off at a depth of no less than two (2) to three (3) feet. 
c.  Where permitted, industrial buildings should use architectural elements and enhanced building ornamentation that complements the building materials and style to break up any blank wall space permitted by the standards. Fake windows that imitate transparency are not recommended for buildings where lack of transparency may otherwise be acceptable. 
d.  Glazing or heavy tints, reflective treatment, simulated windows, banded windows or glass curtains disrupt the scale and permeability of a building and should not be used. 
6.  Building materials: 
a.  All buildings should be constructed according to the following material standards. Percentage requirements for materials exclude windows or other openings. 
i.  Primary Materials. All buildings should have one (1) primary material covering at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the building façades. 
ii.  Secondary Materials. Buildings may have a secondary material covering up to thirty percent (30%) of the façades. 
iii.  Accent Materials. Buildings should have at least one (1), and may have up to two (2) accent or trim materials covering between five percent (5%) and ten percent (10%) of the building façades. 
iv.  Permitted Materials. Exterior materials should be permitted in accordance with the following table: 
Primary Materials Secondary Materials Accent/Trim Materials Brick, unpainted. 
  
Stone, unpainted. 
  
Stucco 
  
Or equal or better simulated materials Any of the Primary Materials may be used as Secondary Materials 
  
Glass 
  
Standing Seam Metal 
  
Color Concrete Any of the Primary or Secondary Materials may be used as an accent material 
  
Wood trim (or equal or better simulated material) 
  
Precast stone, or wood moldings or similar architectural details (or equal or better simulated material)  
b.  Where "equal or better" simulated materials should only be used as follows: 
i.  If the proposed material has an identical physical appearance as the material it intended to simulate, including color and texture, as perceived from any public spaces surrounding the property; 
ii.  If the material presents benefits in addition to cost savings, such as reduced maintenance, or enhanced durability and performance; 
iii.  If the material has a demonstrated track record of successful application and use that will result in equally long-lasting and sustainable appeal of the neighborhood as that of the permitted materials; and 
iv.  The use of equal or better materials is applied in compliance with all manufacturer specifications. 
c.  Each distinct building material should be of uniform color. The compilation of building materials should form a compatible color pallet. Primary and any secondary materials should use muted or earth tone colors. Accent and trim materials may use bold or vibrant colors. 
B.  Site design. The design of individual sites impacts streetscapes, site access and circulation, and the function and aesthetics for the entire corridor. Site designs must account for vehicle traffic in a manner that least disrupts pedestrian activity to and immediately surrounding a building. 
1.  Streetscapes: 
a.  All development should be reviewed in relation to the impact on the long-range street design scenarios in the Burlington Corridor Study. Refer to the study for the three (3) primary street design scenarios - North Area; Central Area; and South Area. 
b.  Individual projects should preserve the potential for these concepts to be done, and include site designs that reinforce these concepts with proper building placement and orientation. 
c.  Larger or block-scale projects should implement these concepts on critical segments of the streetscape in association with new development. 
d.  Projects that conflict with these concepts should only be approved on a finding by the City that they will not pursue long-term capital projects for that segment of the street, and that incremental implementation through a series of private projects is not possible. 
2.  Curb cuts: 
a.  Curb cuts should be limited on Burlington. Sites that have access by side streets or rear alley systems should use these access points for vehicles. 
b.  Curb cuts on Burlington should be consolidated within blocks. A single central curb cut that provides access to a shared easement circulation system is preferred. 
c.  Curb cuts on Burlington should be as narrow as possible to avoid disruption of the streetscape and pedestrian flow. In areas planned for higher pedestrian traffic slower turning movements off Burlington are desired and narrower curb cuts should be sued. Single-lane, one-way entry ways with access to more remote portions of the site are preferred over wide access to prominent portions of the site. 
d.  Curb cuts should be designed to provide the least disruption to pedestrian facilities along the corridor, and wherever possible the grade and surface shall be maintained over vehicle access points. 
3.  Parking location: 
a.  On-street parking should be prioritized and permitted to contribute to on-site parking requirements. 
b.  For any area where a Parking Management District is established, parking requirements should be waived. 
c.  Sites with access to frequent transit service, and where the nature of the use of the building is frequented by transit patrons, should consider a reduced parking count. 

Illustration #18
d.  Parking should be located on remote portions of the site, ideally to the rear of the building and accessible to the streetscape from pedestrian passages. 
e.  Where parking is permitted to the side or front of the building, it should be screened from the streetscape at the extension of the street wall. This screen may be a small "courtyard wall" constructed of the same material as the principal building, ornamental fencing, or year-round evergreen landscape materials. ( Illustration #18 ). 
f.  Parking areas should be designed as shared space wherever possible. For example parking that can serve as a courtyard or similar outdoor space when not in use or for special events are encouraged. 
g.  Parking over the minimum required parking should be discouraged unless it is part of a shared parking program or if it is otherwise mitigated by some improved design features beyond the standards of these guidelines. 
4.  Civic open spaces ( Illustration #19 ). 

Illustration #19
a.  Areas of the street edge that are not occupied by buildings should be designed as active spaces, either as extensions of the public streetscape ("shared use zones" in the Burlington Corridor Study) or as civic open spaces associated with the use of the building. 
  
b.  Civic open spaces should provide space for people to congregate, transition from the public streetscape, and emphasize important elements of the building or site ( Illustration #20 ). 

Illustration #20
c.  A balance of landscape and hardscape elements for more formal open spaces should be used for these areas. 
  

Illustration #21
d.  Larger buildings with continuous street walls along the streetscape should provide pedestrian passages between the streetscape and any rear parking areas. ( Illustration #21 ) 
e.  Where a series of buildings are setback from the street wall for any reason, they should be oriented around a common civic space that contains direct pedestrian paths from the streetscape. 
5.  Landscape and screening: 
a.  Landscape materials should be used to define the edge of unbuilt portions of sites along the streetscape (i.e. areas without direct building frontages or civic open spaces): 
i.  Landscape materials should form a low edge on all non-building frontages, and in particular on any permitted on-site parking areas. Materials should provide a four-season screen and should be a minimum thirty-six (36) inches high. 
ii.  Longer expanses of non-building frontages should include vertical elements to reinforce the street wall along the block. Gaps larger than fifty (50) linear feet should have one (1) two and one-half-inch caliper tree for every thirty (30) feet of frontage. Species should reach a height of more than thirty (30) feet high at maturity. Street trees should be consistent with requirements of Chapter 12.40. 
iii.  Screen any other high-intensity site elements (mechanical equipment, vehicle service bays or loading areas, etc.) from view of the right-of-way with landscape elements. 
iv.  Provide ornamental foundation plantings along any building frontages setback from the right-of-way by more than ten (10) feet. Foundation planting beds should be at least eight (8) feet deep. 
v.  On narrow blocks where two (2) tiers of lots are not possible, additional screening techniques and buffer areas should be used adjacent to the public street. 
b.  Develop low-maintenance landscapes. 
i.  Use low-water species. 
ii.  Incorporate native plants, or use other species that adapt well to the climate, seasonal variations, and soils of this region 
c.  Create high-performance landscapes where possible. 
i.  Find opportunities to "disconnect" paved surfaces from the storm water system and streets through intervening landscape areas. 
ii.  Plant species that provide potential to infiltrate storm water where soils and conditions allow. 
iii.  Incorporate landscape designs that enhance the environmental performance and energy programs for the site and building. 
C.  Block scale master plans and "Shared use Area". A key component of the Burlington Corridor Study is the "shared use area" of the streetscape concepts, and supporting more pedestrian and urban-scaled development supported by the streetscape concepts. The study recognizes that this approach may need to be phased in over time, particularly in the North area. The easiest way to accomplish this is block-scale master plans, where streetscape designs, access, parking and site design of various owners can be coordinated, and where redevelopment of sites can then occur under each landowner's individual time frame according to the block-scale master plan. 
    The standards and design guidelines support the vision of the Burlington Corridor Study. However, where sites propose development that deviates from the standards and guidelines, it should only be done according to block-scale master plans that support the broader corridor interests beyond the individual site. Particularly in the North area, these plans should advance the following concepts: 
1.  Each block shall incorporate additional right-of-way, or cross access easements that replicate the shared use area of the street design concepts and links to similar pedestrian and shared use areas on adjacent blocks on the corridor. 
2.  Cross-access areas shall replicate the shared use areas or boulevard "slip streets" for urban areas in a continuous manner along the block, including narrow vehicle lanes, "on-street" parking on one (1) or both sides of the vehicle lane, street trees, pedestrian areas, and "street-front" buildings. 
3.  Buildings may be set back greater than ten (10) feet from current right-of-way provided that all buildings still frame positive shared, common or public space along the block, similar to the Building Form and Design Guidelines. 
4.  Additional setback areas may be used for the following, provided it is coordinated along the entire lengths of the block: 
a.  Landscape areas including a trail corridor along the Burlington Corridor ( Illustration #22 & #23 ); 
b.  Parking "blocks" providing front parking; provided a "slip street" is located along all lot and building frontages, an enhanced pedestrian area is shifted off Burlington and provided at the building frontage along the "slip street", and parking is buffered from the corridor ( Illustration #23, Option 2 ); or 
c.  Single or double bays of front parking provided that the parking is buffered from the corridor and a continuous pedestrian easement is provided along all building frontages which directly connects to pedestrian routes on adjacent blocks, and the parking areas include connections between pedestrian facilities along Burlington and the building frontage areas. ( Illustration #22, Option 1 ). 
5.  Any front parking shall include frequent and direct dedicated pedestrian connections between pedestrian routes on Burlington and building frontages set back from Burlington.

Chapter 17.70 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 

17.70.010 - Purposes. 
    The planned unit development (PUD) provides for project variety and diversity in any zoning district through the process established in this chapter. Development flexibility is provided in exchange for on-going community benefits that achieve the following purposes: 
A.  To encourage a mix of different land uses which results in: 
1.  Commercial, office, recreational and educational facilities conveniently located to residential uses; 
2.  Economic benefits to the public due to efficient use of land and of public and private services; 
3.  Lessen the burden of traffic on streets, roads, and highways; 
4.  Commercial, institutional and employment based land uses, accessible to residential land uses by multiple modes of transportation, including walking, biking, transit or automobiles; or 
5.  Increased public open spaces in higher density residential and mixed-use settings. 
B.  To encourage innovations in residential, commercial, recreational and industrial development and redevelopment which: 
1.  Results in better management of or reduction in the environmental impacts of development on the surrounding community; or 
2.  Relates the type, design, and layout of residential, commercial, recreational, and industrial development to the particular site, thereby encouraging preservation of important natural and environmental characteristics of the site. 
C.  To allow flexibility in the application of the zoning requirements regarding bulk, setbacks, lot sizes, and open space, due to unique physical conditions of a particular site, while ensuring that such flexibility will not be used in a manner that distorts the objectives of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 8720, § 8, 11-19-2013) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 8720, § 8, adopted Nov. 19, 2013, repealed former § 17.70.010, and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former section pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 7500, § 1, 2002. 
17.70.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Minimum District Size. A site proposed for a planned unit development shall contain a contiguous area of five acres or more, unless the planning commission and city council find that a smaller district is appropriate due to special and unusual circumstances. In no case shall the contiguous site area be less than two acres. Property is contiguous if all parts are under unified control and abut or are separated only by a road, easement or right-of-way. 
B.  Additions. Additions to existing planned unit developments shall have no minimum size provided that: 
1.  The addition is contiguous with the original planned unit development; 
2.  The addition can be fully integrated in function, operation, and aesthetics, into the original planned unit development; and 
3.  The addition is subject to all approval standards of the original planned unit development. 
(Ord. 7500 § 1 (part), 2002) 
17.70.030 - Establishment of allowed and conditional uses. 
A.  Allowed Uses. Any use specifically authorized in a zoning district may become part of a planned unit development, provided the council finds the use compatible with the existing and planned uses in the development and on adjacent properties. 
B.  Conditional Uses. All uses allowed by conditional use permit pursuant to Section 17.84 may become part of a planned unit development, provided that all of the procedures and requirements for that conditional use are met. 
C.  Adoption and Modification of Authorized Uses. The council, at the time of adoption of an ordinance establishing a PUD shall list the uses that are authorized by right and by conditional use permit. All authorized uses shall be subject to applicable permit and approval processes established in these regulations. Modification of the authorized use lists for any PUD shall be processed pursuant to a rezoning application as established in 17.96. 
(Ord. 7500 § 1 (part), 2002) 
17.70.040 - Development standards. 
A.  Generally. Planned unit developments shall comply with the standards for the zoning district most closely associated with each proposed use, except where the city finds that public or private amenities provided by the proposed development exceed those that would be achieved through development that strictly complies with the minimum standards of the zoning districts. 
B.  Modification of Standards. 
1.  Mixed Use PUDs. A mixed-use PUD shall include at least two land uses which are not allowed together in any single zoning district, and each use must account for at least twenty-five (25) percent of the land area. The remaining fifty (50) percent of the land area may be used for any use approved through the plan. Any mixed-use PUD may modify the zoning district standards as follows: 
a.  Residential Density and Nonresidential intensity. Residential density and nonresidential floor area ratios may, in the discretion of the planning commission and city council, be increased by up to ten (10) percent of the regular district standards if the PUD contains: 
i.  A mix of housing types including single-family, two-family, and multi-family, integrated throughout the PUD; 
ii.  Uses, designed within convenient walking distance of the majority of residences, that commonly and customarily support the residential neighborhoods, such as a neighborhood grocery store, a neighborhood hardware store, personal services, recreational facilities, and public institutions; 
iii.  Increased open space and parks, accessible throughout the PUD, for active or passive recreation; 
iv.  Transportation amenities, including walking trails, bicycle trails or lanes, and transit facilities; 
v.  A street layout that provides multiple connections and access points for all of the various uses and provides multiple route options between the various uses; 
vi.  Architectural standards that assure the compatibility of the different types of residential uses, and of the residential and nonresidential uses; or 
vii.  Any other provisions in excess of the minimum standards that the planning commission and city council determines necessary to add to the public benefit and offset the increase in density. 
b.  Dimensional Standards. Dimensional standards such as setbacks, building height, lot area may be modified if the applicant can demonstrate that: 
i.  Buildings can be designed safely and compatibly with lesser setbacks; 
ii.  Modification of the dimensional standards is offset by readily accessible public, private, or common open space; and 
iii.  All buildings are provided with adequate emergency access for fire protection, emergency management technicians, or other public safety concern. 
c.  Parking and landscape requirements are subject to the provisions of Chapters 17.76 and 17.78, respectively. 
d.  The adopted building code of the City of North Kansas City shall not be varied or modified in any manner by the adoption of a PUD. Any modification of the building code shall be by the procedures set forth in that code. 
2.  Single-Use PUDs. A PUD which contains only uses which could be authorized in a single zoning district or any plan not meeting the requirements of a mixed-use PUD in 17.70.040 (B)(1) may modify the zoning district standards subject to the following: 
a.  The modification will only be allowed for: 
i.  Innovations in site development which result in less or better management of the environmental impacts of development on the surrounding community, or which allow preservation of important natural and environmental characteristics of the site by incorporating them into the site design; or 
ii.  To allow flexibility in the application of the zoning requirements due to unique physical conditions of a particular site, while ensuring that such flexibility will not be used in a manner that distorts the objectives of these regulations. 
b.  Dimensional standards. Dimensional standards such as setbacks, building height, lot area may be modified if the applicant can demonstrate that: 
i.  Buildings can be designed safely and compatibly with lesser setbacks; 
ii.  Modification of the dimensional standards is offset by readily accessible public, private, or common open space; 
iii.  All buildings are provided with adequate emergency access for fire protection, emergency management technicians, or other public safety concern; and 
iv.  The purpose of 17.70.040(B)(2)(a) above, could only be achieved by the modification of the standards. 
c.  Residential Density and Nonresidential intensity. Residential density and floor area ratios for non residential uses shall not be modified for single-use PUDs. 
d.  Parking and landscape requirements are subject to the provisions of Chapters 17.76 and 17.78, respectively. 
e.  The adopted building code of the City of North Kansas City shall not be varied or modified in any manner by the adoption of a PUD. Any modification of the building code shall be by the procedures set forth in that code. 
C.  Approved Plan. No use of the parcel, nor construction, modification or alteration of any use or structure within a PUD shall be permitted unless such construction or use complies with the terms and conditions of the approved plan. 
    Each subsequent owner and/or entity created by the development, such as a property owner's association or an architectural review committee, shall comply with the terms and conditions of the approved plan. A seller of a property that is zoned PUD or which is in the process of receiving such approval shall notify the buyer of the terms and conditions of PUD approval. The City bears no liability for misrepresentation of terms and conditions of an existing approval. 
    The developer shall set forth the conditions of approval within covenants that shall be recorded with the final approved map and plan. 
D.  Surrounding Land Use. The PUD shall be designed and arranged so that all uses on the perimeter of the PUD are compatible with surrounding land uses, such that the PUD may be integrated into the existing surrounding land uses rather than separated with buffers.

6.  Shared Parking. By conditional use permit, the city may authorize a reduction in the number of parking spaces for multiple use developments or for uses that are located near one another and which have different peak parking demands and operating hours. The city may consider such shared parking, but shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  As a part of the application materials required for a conditional use permit, the applicant seeking shared parking shall submit a study to the zoning administrator which: (1) clearly establishes that uses will make use of the shared spaces at different times of the day, week, month or year; (2) addresses the size and types of activities, composition of tenants, rate of turnover for parking spaces, and anticipated peak parking and traffic loads; (3) that such a study is based upon the Urban Land Institute's "shared parking" table provided below, or other industry standards as the city determines to be acceptable for the types of uses proposed. 
b.  Shared Parking Table. Parking requirements shall be the cumulative requirements of the uses sharing the parking, except where different categories of uses (retail or service, employment, civic, or dwellings) are participating in the sharing agreement and are likely to generate distinctly different times of peak parking demand. The following table is a base guide for shared parking. Each use should provide a percentage of parking required by these regulations according to the shared parking table below. Whichever time period column requires the highest total parking spaces among the various uses should be the amount of parking provided subject to the shared parking agreement. Alternative parking allocations may be approved as a function of the conditional use permit based on industry data or other sufficient evidence and analysis of peak parking demands for specific uses.

c.  If proposed for multiple parcels or lots, the shared parking plan shall be enforced through a written agreement signed by the property owner(s), to be reviewed and approved by the zoning administrator and city counselor, and which shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds. 
d.  Should any of the shared parking uses be changed, or the zoning administrator find that any of the conditions described in the parking study no longer exist, the zoning administrator may require a revised shared parking study and an amended shared parking agreement. 
e.  Failure to comply with the shared parking requirements of this subsection shall constitute a violation of these regulations and shall be a cause for revocation of the conditional use permit. 
7.  Deferral of Required Spaces. A portion of the parking area required by this title may remain unimproved until such time as the site plan review committee deems it must be improved to adequately serve current parking demand. A permit for construction of such delayed improvement may be issued only after the site plan review committee is satisfied that the initial occupancy of the premises will be adequately served by the lesser number of spaces and only after approval of a final development plan indicating clearly the location, pattern and circulation to and from the initial and the delayed parking spaces. The land area so delineated for future parking shall be brought to finished grade, be landscaped, and shall not be used for building, storage, loading or other purposes. Appeals to the decisions of the site plan review committee may be made to the planning commission. 
8.  Parking Space Reduction Under the Minimum Required. 
a.  Minor reductions (ten (10) percent or less) from the required number of parking spaces may be approved by the staff site plan review committee:

ii.  When the evidence presented, indicates the lesser number of spaces will be sufficient for the needs of the specified use on the site; and 
iii.  When such a reduction better promotes the goals stated in the statement of purpose section of this chapter. 
b.  Significant reductions greater than ten (10) percent may be approved by the planning commission: 
i.  Upon consideration of the proposed use as well as potential future uses of the site; 
ii.  When the requested reduction is based on upon such credible sources as the most recent versions of either the APA Parking Standards PAS Report, or the ITE Parking Generation report; 
iii.  When the evidence presented, indicates the lesser number of spaces will be sufficient for the needs of the specified use on the site; and 
iv.  When such a reduction better promotes the goals stated in the statement of purpose section of this chapter. 
c.  Reductions (twenty (20) percent or less) from the required number of parking spaces shall be approved if: 
i.  Any portion of the property is within five hundred (500) feet of a heavy passenger rail, light rail, streetcar, or trolley station; 
ii.  Any portion of the property is within two hundred fifty (250) feet of a bus rapid transit stop (a bus route with stops no more than every one-quarter mile); or

9.  Parking Space Increase Over the Maximum Permitted. 
a.  Minor increases (ten (10) percent or less) above the maximum number of parking spaces may be approved by the staff site plan review committee: 
i.  Upon consideration of the proposed use as well as potential future uses of the site; and 
ii.  When the evidence presented, indicates the greater number of spaces will be sufficient for the needs of the specified use on the site. 
b.  Significant increases greater than ten (10) percent may be approved by the planning commission: 
i.  Upon consideration of the proposed use as well as potential future uses of the site; 
ii.  When the requested increase is based on upon such credible sources as the most recent versions of either the APA Parking Standards PAS Report, or the ITE Parking Generation report; and 
iii.  When the evidence presented, indicates the greater number of spaces will be sufficient for the needs of the specified use on the site.

--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 8721, §§ 1, 2, adopted Nov. 19, 2013, repealed former Ch. 17.80, §§ 17.80.010-17.80.050, and enacted a new Ch. 17.80 as set out herein. The former chapter pertained to nonconforming structures and uses, and derived from Ord. No. 7500, § 1, 2002; Ord. No. 8418, § 12, 8-25-2009. 

17.80.010 - General standards. 
A.  Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming uses, sites, lots, and structures. 
B.  Applicability. This chapter applies to any nonconformity. There are four categories of nonconformities: 
1.  Nonconforming uses: A use that was lawfully established but that no longer complies with the use regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located. 
2.  Nonconforming sites: A lot, parcel, or development site that was lawfully established but that does not comply with the standards of the zoning ordinance. 
3.  Nonconforming structure: A structure that was lawfully erected but that no longer complies with all the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the structure is located. 
4.  Nonconforming lot: A lot that fails to meet the requirements for area, height, yards, buffer, or other bulk standards and regulations, generally applicable in the district because of a change in the applicable zoning district regulations, annexation, condemnation or a portion of the lot, or other governmental action. 
C.  Continuance. On or after the effective date of the zoning ordinance, a nonconformity that was lawfully operated, established, or commenced in accordance with the provisions of all ordinances, statutes, or regulations in effect at that time, or any building, site, lot, or structure which may become nonconforming upon the adoption of this title or of any subsequent amendment hereto, may continue in accordance with the regulations of this chapter. 
D.  Abandonment. If a nonconformity is abandoned for six months, any future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Abandonment of a nonconformity shall terminate the right to continue the nonconformity. 
E.  Control Over Use. No site, lot, or structure shall hereafter be used, or occupied, and no structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, or altered, except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located; except, that in residential district, a lot in an ownership which was of record at the time of adoption of this title, though not meeting the requirements of this title as to area and width, may be used for single-family residential purposes, provided that such use conforms with all other applicable regulations of this title. 
(Ord. No. 8721, § 2, 11-19-2013) 
17.80.020 - Nonconforming uses. 
    This section applies to the continuation, enlargement, or expansion of a nonconforming use. 
A.  Continuance. The lawful use of any structure existing as of the effective date of this chapter may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter. Such use may be extended throughout the structure, provided that no structural alterations or additions to the structure, except those made in conformance with law or ordinance. 
B.  Enlargement. A conforming structure in which a nonconforming use is operated shall not be enlarged or extended except as required by law or ordinance. 
C.  Conditions. The right of nonconforming uses to continue is subject to such regulations as to the maintenance of the premises and conditions of operation as may, in the judgment of the board of adjustment, be reasonably required for the protection of adjacent property. 
D.  Change of Use. 
1.  Changes to Conforming Uses. Any nonconforming use may be changed to a use conforming with these regulations established for the district in which the nonconforming use is located, provided, however, that a nonconforming use so changed shall not in the future be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
2.  Changes to Other Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use by order of the board of zoning adjustment, provided that the new use is determined to be more consistent with the spirit of the zoning ordinance, the neighborhood, and the comprehensive plan. A nonconforming use that is changed to another nonconforming use shall not be changed back to the former nonconforming use. All changes of nonconforming uses shall conform to all applicable regulations of the zoning ordinance. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use that requires more off-street parking and loading space than the former nonconforming use unless additional adequate off-street parking and loading space is provided. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use unless the original nonconforming use was registered in conformance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 8721, § 2, 11-19-2013) 
17.80.030 - Nonconforming sites. 
    This section applies to the continuation, enlargement, or expansion of a nonconforming site. 
A.  Continuance. Any lawfully existing nonconforming site may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to this section. 
B.  Extension. A conforming use located on a nonconforming site shall not be expanded until the site is brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter. However, single-family residential structures that are located on a legally nonconforming site with respect to required yards, areas, or height may be structurally altered or enlarged, providing the portion of the structure that is altered or enlarged conforms with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Relocation. No structure shall be relocated to a nonconforming site until the site is brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  Abandonment. When the use of a nonconforming site has been abandoned for a period of twelve (12) months, the site shall not be used, developed, or improved until it is brought into conformance with this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, rental payments or lease payments and taxes shall be not be considered as a continued use, and the disconnection of utilities shall constitute a means of establishing the commencement of the abandonment of the use of the development site. 
(Ord. No. 8721, § 2, 11-19-2013) 
17.80.040 - Nonconforming lots. 
    This section applies to the continuation, enlargement, or expansion of a nonconforming lot. 
A.  Generally. A substandard lot shall comply with the yard, buffer, setback, and bulk regulations of the zoning district that makes the lot conforming with respect to the area of the lot. This section does not require the replatting or combination of platted lots under same ownership that is protected by state vested rights law.

17.80.050 - Nonconforming structures. 
    This section applies to the continuation, enlargement, or expansion of a nonconforming structure. 
A.  Continuance. Subject to all limitations in this chapter, any nonconforming structure may be occupied, operated, and maintained in a state of good repair, but no nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or extended. 
B.  Enlargement. A nonconforming structure in which only conforming uses are operated may be enlarged or extended if the enlargement or extension can be made in compliance with all of the provisions of this chapter established for structures in the district in which the nonconforming structure is located. Such enlargement shall also be subject to all other applicable city ordinances. 
C.  Termination. The right to operate and maintain any nonconforming structure shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the nonconforming structure is damaged in any manner and from any cause whatsoever, and the cost of repairing such damage exceeds fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost of such structure on the date of such damage. In determining the replacement cost of any nonconforming structure, the cost of land or any factors other than the nonconforming structure itself shall not be included. 
(Ord. No. 8721, § 2, 11-19-2013) 
17.80.060 - Certificate of nonconforming use. 
A.  Generally. The owner of a nonconformity may register such nonconformity by filing with the director of community development a registration statement. 
B.  Exemptions. Registration is not required for any use or structure that is made nonconforming by any governmental action other than annexation or rezoning, any fence of legal height and construction, or any nonconforming lot. 
C.  Contents. Registration may be made on behalf of the owner by any person, firm, corporation, or other entity that has a legal or equitable interest in the nonconformity. Registration statements shall require a disclosure of the complete ownership of the land and/or structure, and shall be in such form and require the furnishing of such information, photographs, and documentation as are needed to show that: 
1.  The use was lawfully established prior to the effective date of the applicable regulations; 
2.  The use has been continuously maintained since it was established; and 
3.  The use has not been abandoned. 
D.  Denial of Registration. The director of community development may deny any registration if it appears that the documents relied thereon are not valid, or that the documents produced do not show the existence of a lawful nonconformity in accordance with the criteria set above. The applicant may appeal this determination to the board of zoning adjustment. 
E.  Amendment. At any time after registration, upon application to the director of community development and with the written consent of the owner affected thereby, a registration statement may be amended to indicate changes in ownership. A copy of each registration statement shall be returned to the owner and a copy filed among the records of the department. The director of community development shall accept and file all tendered registration statements within the permitted time period, but the acceptance of such statements shall not constitute an authorization to operate an unlawful use. The filing of a false registration statement with the department shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

B.  Criteria for Conditional Use Permit. In addition to the criteria required to be met for a CUP, the following criteria shall apply to the issuance of a CUP for the expansion of a nonconformity: 
1.  The termination of such nonconformity will result in unnecessary hardship; 
2.  The continuation of the nonconformity will not be contrary to the public interest; 
3.  The continuation of the nonconformity will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming property in the same district; 
4.  The use will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of these regulations and the master plan goals, objectives, and policies; 
5.  The plight of the applicant for which the continuation of the nonconformity is sought is due to unique circumstances existing on the property and/or within the surrounding district; 
6.  The continuation of the nonconformity will not substantially weaken the general purposes of this chapter or the regulations established in this chapter for the applicable zoning district; and 
7.  The continuation of the nonconformity will not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
C.  Conditions Applicable. Any conditions attached to any rezoning, CUP, variance, use permitted by planning commission review, or any other development approval or development order issued under any previously enacted zoning regulations, subdivision, or other land development regulations shall continue to apply to the proposed use and shall be enforceable as provided in this chapter. Such conditions may be waived if an application is approved pursuant to this chapter whereby the applicant agreed to waive and abandon all right secured under the regulations formerly in effect.

Chapter 17.84 - CONDITIONAL USES 
Sections: 

17.84.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The development and administration of the zoning ordinance is based on the division of the city into districts, within any one of which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related to land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are conditional uses which, because of their unique character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the particular use of the particular location. Such conditional uses fall into three categories: 
1.  Uses operated by a public agency or public-regulated utilities, or uses traditionally affected with a public interest; and 
2.  Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities; and 
3.  Uses which are of a short duration and short range impact on the community and thus do not require planning commission review. 
B.  Where a use exists on the effective date of this title and is classified as a conditional use by this title, it shall be considered to be a lawful conditional use. Additions or alterations to existing buildings or land improvements for expansion of lawful conditional uses may be made upon approval of a conditional use permit as set out in this chapter, and they shall be subject to yard, floor area ratio and building height requirements set forth in this title for permitted uses in the districts in which they are located unless otherwise specifically granted as part of the conditional use permit. 
(Ord. 7500 § 1 (part), 2002) 
(Ord. No. 8418, § 13, 8-25-2009) 
17.84.020 - Conditional uses. 
A.  The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city council may provide such conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location and operation of a conditional use including time limit, provisions for off-street parking and loading and other conditions as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of this ordinance and to minimize any injury to the value of property in the neighborhood. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit for such conditional use. 
B.  Where not otherwise authorized as a permitted use, any of the following uses may be located in any district by conditional use permit: 
1.  Amusement parks, privately owned baseball or athletic fields, race tracks; 
2.  Helicopter ports under such restrictions as the council may impose on land, buildings or structures within an approach zone to promote safety of navigation and prevent undue danger from confusing lights, electrical interference or other hazards; 
3.  Cemeteries, mausoleums or crematories for the disposal of the dead; 
4.  Clubs;

b.  Purpose. The general purpose of this section is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of wireless facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless communications marketplace in the city. Specifically, this section is intended to: (i) Provide for the appropriate location and development of wireless facilities and related equipment; (ii) Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless facilities and related equipment through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques that provide predictability for nearby property owners and others that future uses will not materially alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input from interested parties; (iii) Ensure that any new wireless facilities are located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible (iv) Ensure that regulation of wireless facilities and related equipment does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service and promotes the provision and availability of communication services within the city; and (v) enhance the ability of the providers of communication services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
c.  Applicability; Preemption. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this Section 17.84.030 shall be applicable to all wireless facilities existing or installed, built or modified after the effective date of this section to the fullest extent permitted by law. No provision of this section shall apply to any circumstance in which such application shall be unlawful under superseding federal or state law and furthermore, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section is now or in the future superseded or preempted by state or federal law or found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be automatically interpreted and applied as required by law. Such zoning review and approvals required in this section shall be in addition to any other generally applicable permitting requirement, including applicable building, excavation, or other right-of-way permits. 
2.  Tower/Antenna Location and Development Standards. 
a.  Location. 
i.  Residential. Television and radio receiving antennas are permitted in residential districts as accessory uses by the occupant of the premises purely for personal enjoyment, amusement, or recreation. Unless otherwise required to be permitted by law, all other wireless facilities are prohibited in residential zoning districts.

3.  The attachment of additional or replacement antennas or accessory equipment to any existing fully conforming wireless facilities where local zoning is preempted by state or federal law, are permitted uses provided that building permit requirements, national safety codes, and other applicable codes including recognized accepted industry standards for structural, safety, capacity, reliability, and engineering are satisfied, including specifically the requirement to submit a satisfactory certified structural engineering report. All modifications to wireless facilities shall require application and approval to amend the existing conditional use permit or other zoning authorization where zoning is not preempted by applicable federal or state law. 
B.  Conditional Use Permit. All wireless facilities not permitted as provided above may be permitted in nonresidential zoning districts only through a conditional use permit; provided that any new support structure in the commercial district shall only be approved as a disguised support structure. 
C.  Permitted or Accessory Use. Wireless facilities may either be a principal use in nonresidential districts or an incidental use, subject to any applicable requirement relating to lot size and setbacks. An incidental use subject to a leasehold interest of a person other than the lot owner may be approved for a support structure only if the leasehold area separately meets all requirements for a separate subdivided lot, including dedicated access, parking, setbacks and lot size, applicable to the district in which the use is proposed and as required herein. 
iii.  Rights-of-Way. For applications for wireless facilities within city rights-of-way, (1) the most restrictive adjacent underlying zoning district classification shall apply unless otherwise specifically zoned and designated on the official zoning map, and (2) no application shall be submitted for permit approval without attaching the city's consent to use the rights-of-way for the specific construction application, to the extent permitted by applicable law; (3) wireless facilities shall be installed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety of the rights-of-way; and (4) such use shall be required to obtain applicable permits and comply with [the] city's ROW management rules and regulations as set forth in Chapter 12.08. 
iv.  All Districts. 
A.  New, Replacement, and Modified Utility Poles.

B.  Fast-Track "Small Wireless Facility." 
1.  Administrative Approval. A small wireless facility, conforming with the requirements of this section, are permitted in all zoning districts by administrative permit approved by the director by submission of an application, including showing specifications, dimensions, photos, or drawings of completed installation, and property owner consent. Provided the applications are complete and address the requirements of this section, the director shall endeavor to expedite these approvals and may combine multiple applications/locations at one time in a single approval. 
2.  General Requirements. The following requirements shall generally apply to all "fast-track" small wireless facilities located within the city: 
i.  The "fast-track" shall substantially match any current aesthetic or ornamental elements of the existing structure or utility pole, or otherwise be designed to maximally blend in to the built environment, with attention to the current uses within the district at the proposed site; 
ii.  Any portion above the existing structure or utility pole shall be concealed and of the same dimensions and appearance so as to appear to be a natural extension of the existing structure or utility pole in lieu of an enclosure or concealment; and 
iii.  The "fast-track" equipment shall not emit noise audible from the building line of any residentially zoned or used property.

All installations shall comply with any air space requirements of the FAA. 
B.  Setback Limitations. All support structures and extensions or attachments thereto and associated buildings/structures shall be separated from any public rights-of-way, sidewalk or street, alley, parking area, playground, or building (except for parking and buildings dedicated solely for access to or maintenance of the support structure), and from any property line, by a distance equal to the height of the support structure as measured from the fence around the support structure, if any, or if no fence then from the furthest extension on the support structure. Support structures shall be reasonably designed to reduce the potential damage to persons or property from falling ice or equipment from the support structure or from wind damage or structural failure. 
c.  Separation. Unless otherwise required by law, the minimum separation of towers shall be as follows: 
Tower Height Existing Towers Proposed Tower <50 feet 50-100 feet 101-150 feet >150 feet <50 feet 300 feet 500 feet 750 feet 1,000 feet 50-100 feet 500 feet 750 feet 1,000 feet 1,500 feet 101-150 feet 750 feet 1,000 feet 1,500 feet 2,000 feet >150 feet 1,000 feet 1,500 feet 2,000 feet 2,500 feet  
d.  Aesthetics. 
i.  Equipment Storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a wireless facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the wireless facility unless repairs to the wireless facility are being accomplished. 
ii.  Towers. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or be painted a neutral color as determined by the planning and zoning commission and city council so as to minimize visual obtrusiveness. Tower finish shall be subject to any FAA requirements and any conditions as approved by conditional use permit. All new towers shall be of a monopole design without use of lattice or guy wire support and be engineered and designed with sufficient depth, counter-weight and other mechanisms to address wind-loading and other failure risks under all reasonably anticipated conditions and circumstances. Towers shall use materials, colors, and textures to conform to the existing natural setting and built environment. 
iii.  Antenna Design. Antennas attached to a support structure shall be contained within the disguised support structure or within or mounted flush on the surface of the tower to which they are mounted so as not to defeat the disguised design. Antennas attached to an existing building, utility pole, or structure shall be of a color identical to the surface to which they are mounted. All antennas shall be designed to be disguised and maximally concealed on or within the support structure. Exposed antennas on "crow's nest" or other visible platforms or extensions are prohibited. Any support structure approved as a disguised support structure shall have as a condition of approval, unless expressly exempted in the approval, an obligation and corresponding covenant recorded on the property that runs with the land to the benefit of the city on behalf of the public, prohibiting modifications of the disguised support structure that eliminate or are materially detrimental to the disguise, unless such is approved by a duly authorized zoning or conditional use approval approved in the same manner as required for an original construction of such disguised support structure with the proposed modification. If the applicant does not wish to have such a covenant, the application shall not qualify as a disguised support structure, unless another mechanism is proposed and approved to ensure that the disguise is not subsequently eliminated or materially detrimentally altered. 
iv.  Accessory Equipment. Design of all accessory equipment shall use materials, colors, and textures to conform to the existing natural setting and built environment. All materials, colors and textures shall be subject to review and approval by the planning commission and city council. 
v.  Disguised Support Structure. Antenna installed on disguised support structures shall have antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment that is inside the disguised support structure or of a color and appearance that is identical to or compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to ensure that the antenna and accessory equipment is visually unobtrusive. 
vi.  Ground Equipment. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the natural or built environment of the site and shall also comply with any reasonable appearance guidelines as may be applicable to the particular zoning district in which the facility is located. All equipment shall be either placed underground, contained in a single shelter or cabinet, or wholly concealed within a building or approved walled compounds. 
vii.  Compound Walls/Landscaping. All towers shall be surrounded by a minimum of six foot high decorative wall constructed of brick, stone or comparable masonry materials and a landscape strip of not less than ten (10) feet in width and planted with materials, which will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six feet. The landscape strip shall be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an alternative means of screening may be approved by the zoning administrator, or by the city council in the case of a conditional use permit, upon demonstration by the applicant that an equivalent degree of visual screening will be achieved. Disguised support structures may be required to provide landscaping to provide a visual barrier which is appropriate with the disguised support structure as may approved by the zoning administrator or the city council in the case of a conditional use permit. 
viii.  Advertising. Except for a disguised support structure in the form of an otherwise lawfully permitted sign, the placement of advertising on wireless facilities is prohibited other than identification signage or required safety signage of not greater than one square foot on ground equipment. 
ix.  Decorative poles. In districts where there are utility poles which were specifically designed for their aesthetic nature and compatibility with the built environment of that district, as determined by the city, such utility poles shall be deemed to be decorative utility poles. Such decorative utility poles, when authorized to be replaced by an applicant for wireless facilities pursuant to applicable law and in compliance with this section, shall only be replaced with a substantially similar decorative utility pole which matches the aesthetics and decorative elements of the original decorative utility pole being replaced. Such replacement expenses shall be bore wholly by the applicant seeking to place wireless facilities on such decorative utility pole. 
e.  Security. 
i.  Fencing. The tower and any appurtenances shall be safely maintained and fenced or otherwise secured to prevent unauthorized access or climbing of the tower. Barbed, electrified or razor wire is prohibited in commercial districts. Fencing may be required as part of a disguised support structure as determined by the planning and zoning commission and city council to prevent unauthorized access or climbing while still preserving the disguised nature. 
ii.  Lighting. Support structures, small wireless facilities, fast track, and antenna shall only be illuminated as required by the FCC and/or the FAA or other state or federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the required lighting scheme will be made a part of the application to install, build, alter, or modify the support structure, small wireless facilities, fast track or antenna. Security lighting around the base of a support structure may be provided if the lighting is shielded so that no light is directed towards adjacent properties or rights-of-way. Lighting may also be approved as part of a disguised support structure. 
iii.  Additional Security Measures. All wireless facilities shall be protected from unauthorized access by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be provided as part of any application to install, build, or modify wireless facilities. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit as deemed necessary by the zoning administrator or by the city council in the case of a conditional use permit. 
f.  General Provisions. 
i.  Regulatory Compliance. All wireless facilities shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC, and any other local, State or Federal agency with the authority to regulate wireless facilities, and including all required licenses, permits, and taxes applicable to such structure and/or modification. Should such standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling agency. To the extent permitted by law, no approval for any placement, construction or modification of any wireless facilities permitted by this section shall be granted for any applicant having an uncured violation of this section, any zoning regulation regarding the lot on which the structure is proposed, or any other governmental regulatory, licensing, or tax requirement applicable to such antenna or structures within the city unless preempted by applicable law. 
ii.  Public Property. Unless otherwise provided, use or installation of any wireless facility to be located on any public property of the city shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms as the city may require. 
iii.  Parking. One on-site parking spot per carrier for periodic maintenance and service shall be provided at all antenna or support structure locations consistent with the underlying zoning district. 
iv.  Commercial Operation of Unlawful Wireless Facilities.

B.  Maintenance. All wireless facilities and appurtenances shall be adequately maintained and in compliance with all applicable building codes and standards. If upon inspection it is determined that any wireless facility fails to comply with applicable codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the wireless facility, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to remedy any defects and bring the wireless facility into compliance with applicable codes and standards. Failure by the owner to bring a deficient wireless facility into compliance with applicable codes and standards shall be cause for removal of the deficient wireless facility by the city with all costs of removal being the owner's responsibility (and the city shall be authorized to use the abandonment bond, if any, that may have been required pursuant to Section 15.08.020 or other authority). 
ix.  As-Built Plans. Within sixty (60) days of completion of the initial construction and any additional construction, the city shall be furnished one complete set of plans drawn to scale and certified as accurately depicting the location of all wireless facilities constructed. 
x.  Abandonment. Cell sites or wireless facilities not in use for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days for the purpose as stated in the conditional use permit or other approval shall be removed within ninety (90) days of the end of such one hundred eighty (180) day period. Upon removal, the cell site shall be revegetated in conformance with the existing surrounding vegetation. Should the wireless facility not be removed within the specified period, the city may remove the facility at the owner's expense (and the city shall be authorized to use the abandonment bond, if any, that may have been required pursuant to Section 15.08.020 or other authority). 
3.  Application Process. 
a.  Generally. All applications shall be submitted to the city as a complete application on forms provided by the city. A "complete application" shall be an application submitted on the forms provided by the city, fully executed by the applicant, identifying the specific approval sought, and containing all attachments, deposit fees, and information as required thereon or by the city, consistent with this section.

The planning commission may allow amendments or recommend conditions to the application if the effect is to allow a lesser change than that requested on the original application or to reduce the impact of the application or to reduce the amount of land involved from that indicated in the notices of the hearing. The planning commission may not, in any case, recommend a greater amount of development, or a use falling in a different general use category, or a larger land area than indicated in the original application and notice. 
H.  Review Criteria. In determining whether any proposed conditional use permit shall be approved, the planning commission and city council shall consider the following factors: 
1.  Whether the proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the policies embodied in the adopted master plan; 
2.  Whether the proposed use is consistent with the general purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district regulations and complies with the requirements of the zoning ordinance; 
3.  Whether the proposed conditional use may be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, or may result in material damage or prejudice to other property in the vicinity; 
4.  Whether the proposed use is compatible with and preserves the character and integrity of adjacent development and neighborhoods and includes improvements or modifications either on-site or within the public rights-of-way to mitigate any adverse impacts which may result from the development, such as traffic, noise, odors, visual nuisances, or other similar adverse effects; 
I.  Decision by City Council. Following the planning commission's public hearing and receipt of the planning commission's official record, the city council shall consider only the official record and decide whether to approve, conditionally approve or deny the conditional use permit application. The city council may hold its own hearing to take additional evidence or hear additional public comment if it reasonably determines additional evidence or comment is necessary or appropriate and shall supplement the official record accordingly and make its decision thereon. 
J.  Findings Required. The city council's decision shall be contemporaneously accompanied by substantial evidence supporting the decision, which shall be made a part of the written record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is rendered. 
1.  No conditional use permit shall be approved by the city council unless findings in the affirmative are made that the following conditions exist: 
a.  That the applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that placement of wireless facilities permitted as a permitted use or through an administrative permit pursuant to this section is not technologically or economically feasible. The city may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices, among other information, in determining feasibility; 
b.  That the review criteria with or without conditions imposed are generally met; 
c.  If a disguised support structure is proposed, the structure fully satisfies the disguised element requirements, provided that requirement for disguise may be waived if the support structure is otherwise in compliance with this section and the city council finds on a showing by applicant that (1) no disguised support structure(s) could be proposed that are economically and technically feasible to substantially address the need for the tower or (2) if, located in an industrial district, the location and appearance proposed is such that the application still meet the criteria of this section; 
d.  That the design of the wireless facilities, including ground layout, maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with the provisions and intent of this section; 
e.  That the proposed height, location, design, and appearance of the wireless facility is of a type and nature commonly found in the area and shall not materially detrimentally impact the view of the surrounding area, safety, or the surrounding property values or uses. The city council may impose location, appearance, safety or other conditions as may be appropriate to address the nature of the use and conform to the purposes of this code; 
f.  That the proposal fully complies with applicable law including all requirements of this section, provided that an exception to the requirements, other than building or safety code compliance, may be approved upon substantial evidence that compliance is not feasible or is shown to be unreasonable under the specific circumstances shown; 
K.  Scope of Action. The city council may take any action on the application that is consistent with the notice given, conditional approval of the application or denial of the application. The city council may impose conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with applicable general or specific standards stated in these regulations. Any conditions recommended by the zoning administrator or planning commission may be modified by the city council based on the official record. 
L.  Continuances of Proceedings. Given the various time restrictions applicable to approvals under this section, unless otherwise required by law or agreed upon by the applicant and the city, there shall be no continuance granted for the scheduled public hearing, unless the meeting is cancelled for reasons beyond the city's control. 
M.  Amendments and Revisions. The zoning administrator may approve minor revisions to a site plan approved as part of a conditional use permit when authorized in writing by the zoning administrator and limited to those that are necessary in light of technical considerations discovered by the applicant or zoning administrator after the decision on the conditional use permit. 
N.  Revocation of a Conditional Use Permit. Unless otherwise required by law, any conditional use permit granted under the authority of these regulations is subject to revocation pursuant to and in accordance with the procedures in Section 17.96.020.K.3-4 and applicable law. 
O.  Transferability. Unless otherwise required by law, a conditional use permit shall not be transferred without the prior written consent of the city. The transfer of a permit where these conditions have not been satisfied shall be invalid. 
4.  Appeals. The administrative review procedures set forth in Chapter 2.46 shall govern appeals by any aggrieved person of a final action of any city officer, employee, board, commission, or the city council that are claimed by an aggrieved person to be unlawful or an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the review procedures of Chapter 2.46 shall be exhausted before any action may be filed in any court against the city or its officers, employees, boards, officials or commissions. Nothing herein shall be deemed to unlawfully limit any remedy that is required to be available as a matter of law.

The planning commission shall address and resolve any questions concerning the similarity of the second application, material differences, mistakes of fact, or other related issues. Denial of a second application following the one hundred eighty (180) day period shall result in a prohibition on the submission of another application for a period of one year from the second date of denial. 
2.  Appeals. Appeals of a final decision on a rezoning application may be made to the Circuit Court of Clay County. 
3.  Amendinents and Revisions. The zoning administrator may approve minor revisions to a site plan approved as part of a rezoning, subject to the following:

b.  If the applicant requests a revision that the zoning administrator determines is not a minor revision, approval of the revision is required in accordance with the procedures established for the original approval, and shall be considered an amendment to the ordinance approving the rezoning. 
c.  The determination of the zoning administrator on a minor revision is subject to appeal to the board of zoning adjustment.
