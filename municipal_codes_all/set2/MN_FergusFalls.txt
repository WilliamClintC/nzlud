The final finding of the insufficiency or irregularity of a petition shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor shall it prevent the Council from referring the ordinance to the registered voters at the next regular or any special election at its option.

If the attorney advises the Council that the initiated ordinance is contrary to the provisions of the law or this chapter, neither the Council nor any city officer may take any further action with respect to the ordinance. Upon receipt of the attorney’s opinion that the initiated ordinance complies with Section 6.01 or if the attorney does not report to the Council within the 30-day period, at its next meeting the Council shall cause a first reading of the ordinance and refer it to an appropriate committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The Council shall thereupon provide for a public hearing upon the ordinance, after the holding of which the ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the Council not later than sixty (60) days after the date upon which it was submitted to the Council by the City Administrator. If the Council passes the proposed ordinance without amendments, the ordinance need not be submitted to the voters. If the Council passes the proposed ordinance with amendments and at least four-fifths of the sponsoring committee file a statement with the City Administrator approving the amended form within ten (10) days of its passage by the Council, the ordinance need not be submitted to the voters. If the Council fails to enact the ordinance in an acceptable form within seventy (70) days after the final determination of the sufficiency of the petition, the Council must schedule a special election on the earliest date possible under Minnesota law. The ordinance shall be placed on the ballot as stated on the original petition filed with the City Administrator, unless, not later than seventy (70) days after the date upon which it was submitted to the council by the City Administrator, the Council votes to submit the proposed ordinance to the voters with amendments, and at least four-fifths of the sponsoring committee file a statement with the City Administrator approving the amendments within ten (10) days of the City Council vote, in which event the Council must schedule a special election on the amended ordinance on the earliest date permitted under Minnesota law. If the majority of those voting on the ordinance, vote in its favor, it shall become effective thirty (30) days after its adoption unless the ordinance specifies a later effective date.
(Ord. 77, Seventh Series, eff. 1-26-19)
SEC. 6.08. INITIATIVE BALLOTS.

The complete text of the ordinance shall be posted and available for public viewing at all polling places. If a majority of the registered voters voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of the City. Any number of proposed ordinances may be voted upon at the same election but the voter shall be allowed to vote for or against each separately. In case of inconsistency between two initiated ordinances approved at one election, the one approved by the higher percentage of registered voters voting on the question shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
SEC. 6.09. INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right of the registered voters under the Constitution and

Any ordinance, which has been adopted by the Council, but which is not yet effective, and upon which a petition has been filed, shall be suspended in its operation as soon as a petition is found sufficient; all other ordinances, including an emergency ordinance, shall remain in effect, but shall be repealed if the majority of the voters voting on the ordinance vote against it. The Council shall thereupon reconsider the ordinance at its next regular meeting, and either repeal it or by aye and no vote re-affirm its adherence to the ordinance as passed. In the latter case, it shall be placed on the ballot at the next election or at a special election called for that purpose, as the Council determines. If a majority of the voters voting thereon favor the ordinance, it shall go into effect immediately or on the dates specified in the ordinance; if a majority of electors voting thereon vote against the ordinance, it shall be considered repealed upon certification of the election results.
SEC. 6.11. REFERENDUM PETITIONS. The requirements laid down in Sections 6.04 and 6.05 above as to the formation of committees for the initiation of ordinances and as to the form of petitions and signature papers shall apply to the referendum as far as possible, but with such verbal changes as may be necessary.

Failure to timely file the petition invalidates the petition. The petition for the recall shall consist of a copy of the certificate of recall together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto attached. When the official subject to recall is a mayor, such petition shall not be completed unless signed by registered voters of the City equal to at least twenty percent (20%) of the total number of voters registered on the date of the preceding regular municipal election. When the official subject to be recalled is a ward council member, only registered voters who are residents of his ward shall be eligible to sign the recall petition and vote at the recall election and the required number be at least twenty percent (20%) of the total number of registered voters in the ward on the date of preceding regular municipal election. All the signatures need not be on one signature paper, but the circulator of every paper shall make an affidavit that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be.

The City Administrator shall examine the sufficiency of the petition for recall within the next ten (10) days of filing, and if he finds it insufficient in any way, he shall so notify one or more members of the committee of all insufficiencies in writing. The committee shall then be given ten (10) days in which to file additional signature papers and make necessary corrections to the petition with the City Administrator, but they may not change the grounds of the recall. The City Administrator shall have five (5) days to examine the additional signature papers and/or corrections to the petition. If at the end of that time the City Administrator finds the petition still insufficient or irregular, he shall notify all the members of the committee of the insufficiencies in writing and shall file the petition in his office. The final finding that the petition is insufficient shall not prejudice filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
SEC. 6.16. RECALL ELECTION.

If a majority of those voting on the question of recall vote in favor of recall, the official shall be thereby removed from office, and a vacancy shall be deemed to exist in said office. If the official subject to be recalled resigns within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Council of the completed recall petition, a vacancy shall be

If the commission has recommended disapproval of the permit, the Council before approving plans for any proposed building located or to be located in a district shall make findings in regard to the following:
(1) In case of a proposed alteration or addition to an existing building that the alteration or addition will not materially impair the architectural or historic value of the building, and shall make findings considering the existing structure and existing exterior appearance, building height, building width, depth or other dimensions, roof style, type of building materials, ornamentations, paving setback and color.
(2) In case of the proposed demolition of a building, prior to the approval of the demolition, the Council shall make findings on the following: architectural and historic merit of the building, the effect on surrounding buildings, the effect of any new proposed construction on the remainder of the building (in case of partial demolition), and on surrounding buildings, the economic value or usefulness of building as it now exists, or if altered or modified in comparison with the value or usefulness of any proposed structures designated to replace the present building or buildings.

(2) Be 65 years or older or retired by virtue of a permanent and total disability;
(3) Demonstrate that payment of the assessment would be a hardship;
(4) Be obligated to pay an assessment exceeding the amount set by Council resolution; or

(B) Procedure.
(1) A person seeking deferment shall make application to the city on forms prescribed by the County Auditor together with other information required by the city.
(2) The application shall be filed with the City Administrator. An application shall be dated and shall contain a certificate by the applicant that the information therein or made a part thereof is true and correct. The application shall contain a financial statement in form customarily used by a lending institution in the city. It shall also contain a copy of the previous year’s, Minnesota income tax return if one was prepared and/or submitted to the state.
(3) The City Administrator shall consider the application and make a written report to the Council. The City Administrator may interview the applicant. He or she may request additional information from the applicant or others. He or she shall file a report with the Council on or before September 15. The report shall contain a recommended interest rate on any deferred assessment.

(4) The Council shall consider and act upon the application at its first regular Council meeting after September 15. Notwithstanding any provision herein contained respecting hardship, the Council may consider exceptional and unusual circumstances pertaining to an applicant not covered by the standards and guidelines herein set forth.

(5) If a deferment is granted, the City Administrator shall make the proper certification to the County Auditor.

An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less.
DISABILITY. The inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.
HARDSHIP. Financial suffering, privation or trouble that is extremely hard to bear.
PHYSICAL or MENTAL IMPAIRMENT. An impairment that results from anatomical, physiological or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable or medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.
(2) An individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his or her physical or mental impairment or impairments are of a severity that he or she is not only unable to do his or her previous work but cannot, considering his or her age, education and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the state economy, regardless of whether the work exists in the immediate area in which he or she lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him or her, or whether he or she would be hired if he or she applied for work. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “work which exists in the state economy” means work which exists in significant numbers either in the area where the individual lives or in several other areas of the state.
(3) In determining whether or not there is hardship, the City Administrator shall carefully examine the financial status of the applicant. He or she shall determine his or her net worth and his or her net income and he or she shall consider any relevant and special facts concerning his or her financial condition. The City Administrator shall not recommend a deferment for a person with a net worth and a monthly income exceeding the amount set by Council resolution. For the purposes of this section, net income is the previous year’s Minnesota income tax adjusted gross income plus tax exempt income. In the event no income tax form was prepared and/or submitted to the state, the City Administrator shall require the applicant to submit the information which would have been used to determine net income. If the determination of net income does not directly reflect the present financial status of the applicant, he or she may consider other facts.
(4) The City Administrator shall include in his or her report exceptional or unusual circumstances pertaining to hardship together with his or her recommendation respecting the same.
(D) Termination of deferment. The deferment of payment of special assessments shall cease and all amounts accruing plus accumulated interest shall become due and payable upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

(4) If the property, for any reason, shall lose its homestead status; and
(5) If, for any reason, the Council shall determine that there would be no hardship to require immediate or partial payment.
(E) Annual review. The Council shall annually review all deferments previously made. The procedure shall be similar to that used for the consideration of a new application. A determination shall be made concerning hardship and whether or not the deferment shall be continued or whether immediate or partial payment shall be made. Annually the Council shall consider and adopt the amounts to be used in divisions (A) and (C).
(F) Review of applications. The City Administrator shall review applications on behalf of the Council.

All parties are billed whether or not the Fire and Emergency Services are covered by insurance. Any billable amount of the Service Charge not covered by a party’s insurance remains a debt of the party receiving the Fire and Emergency Services.
(3) Parties billed for Fire and Emergency Services have 30 days to pay. If the Service Charge is not paid by that time, it is considered delinquent and the City shall send a notice of delinquency.
(4) If the Service Charge remains unpaid for 30 days after the notice of delinquency is sent, the City may use all practical and reasonable legal means to collect the Service Charge. The party receiving Fire and Emergency Services shall be liable for all collection costs incurred by the City including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
(5) If the Service Charge remains unpaid for 30 days after the notice of delinquency is sent, the City may also, on or before October 15 of each year, certify the unpaid Service Charge to the county auditor of the county in which the recipient of the services owns real property for collection with property taxes levied against the property. The county auditor shall be responsible for remitting to the City all Service Charges collected on behalf of the City. The City must give the property owner written notice of its intent to certify the unpaid Service Charge to the auditor by September 15th.

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES
§ 2.90 ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT.
We put the public interest ahead of our own personal advancement and financial interests. We disclose conflicts of interest and refrain from participating in decisions where we have a financial interest. We avoid actions that might impair independence of judgment or give the appearance of impropriety or a conflict of interest. We do not use our position to gain privileges or special treatment and we do not use public property or personnel for private or personal purposes.
§ 2.901 FIDUCIARY DUTY.
In the performance of their official duties, local officials, employees and volunteers shall act for the benefit of the City.
§ 2.902 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
(A) Definition of Conflicts of Interest. A local official, employee or volunteer of the City, whether paid or unpaid, shall avoid any situation that might give rise to a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is present when, in the discharge of official duties, a local official, employee or volunteer participates in a governmental decision, action or transaction in which he or she has a financial interest, except when the financial interest is no greater than that of another member of his or her business classification, profession or occupation. A financial interest is any interest, including loans, which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit to the local official or employee (other than monetary or material benefits authorized by the City). A financial interest of a local official's employer, employee's employer or volunteer’s employer (other than the City of Fergus Falls), his or her associated business, or his or her spouse, domestic partner, or dependent, and their employers or associated businesses shall also be considered a financial interest of the local official, employee, or volunteer.

(B) Addressing Conflicts of Interest. To address conflicts of interest:
(1) A local official, employee or volunteer shall not participate in making or attempt to use his or her position to influence any City governmental decision, action, or transaction in which the local official, employee or volunteer knows or has reason to know that he or she has a conflict of interest. To participate or participation means making the decision, taking action, entering into a transaction, providing advice or a recommendation, introducing, sponsoring, debating, voting on, approving, and investigating the decision, action, or transaction. Participation includes the direct and active supervision of the participation of a subordinate in the matter. Participation is more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrative or peripheral basis.
(2) A local official, employee or volunteer may participate in a City government decision, action, or transaction involving an organization or entity if the local official, employee or volunteer, or his or her spouse, domestic partner, or dependent is an officer, director, board member, or trustee does not have a financial interest in the governmental decision, action, or transaction. However, the local official, employee or volunteer must disclose his or her affiliation with the organization or entity as though it was a conflict of interest.
(3) A local official, employee or volunteer may participate in a City governmental decision involving a related person, other than his or her spouse, domestic partner or dependent, if the local official, employee or volunteer does not have a financial interest in the governmental decision, action, or transaction. However, the local official, employee or volunteer must disclose his or her relationship with the related person as though it were a conflict of interest.
(C) Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest. If a local official, employee or volunteer, in the discharge of his or her official duties, recognizes that his or her participation would create a conflict of interest, the local official or employee shall disclose the conflict of interest as follows:
(1) The Mayor and members of the City Council shall disclose the conflict of interest to each other as soon as they become aware of the conflict. If such official becomes aware of a conflict during a meeting of the City Council, or one of its committees, the official shall immediately disclose the conflict of interest orally. The Mayor or City Council member shall also prepare, on a form prescribed by the City Administrator, a written statement describing the matter requiring action or decision and the nature of his or her conflict of interest. The written statement shall be distributed to the Mayor and the members of the City Council and filed with the City Administrator. After the first time the local official has orally disclosed a conflict of interest and filed the form, the elected official may subsequently orally disclose a conflict by referring to the form. Because the Mayor or City Council members may not attend all City Council or committee meetings, oral disclosure may consist of the written statement being read into the record by the presiding officer at the first regular meeting of the City Council after the form has been filed.
(2) A department head shall disclose a conflict of interest to the Mayor and the City
ADMINISTRATIVE
58
Council by preparing, on a form prescribed by the City Administrator, a written statement describing the matter requiring action or decision and the nature of his or her conflict of interest.

The written statement shall be distributed to the employee’s immediate supervisor and department head, and filed with the City Administrator.
(4) All initial written statements required by this section shall be filed and distributed within one week after the local official or employee becomes aware of the conflict of interest.
(5) If the local official or employee has a supervisor, the supervisor shall assign the matter, if possible, to another person who does not have a conflict of interest. If they have no immediate supervisor, the local official or employee shall remove himself or herself from participating in the action or decision in question. If the local official is a member of the City Council or Mayor, the local official shall not participate in any discussion or vote on any matter involving the conflict of interest. Although the Mayor or City Council member must abstain from voting on the matter, he or she shall be counted present for purposes of a quorum.
(6) A volunteer shall disclose a conflict of interest orally to the Committee Chairperson, if the volunteer is working on a Committee and said conflict of interest shall also be disclosed orally to the City Administrator. The oral disclosure of a conflict of interest shall include describing the matter requiring action or decision and the nature of the volunteer’s conflict of interest. In all situations a volunteer shall remove him or herself from participating in any action or decision in question in which he or she has a conflict of interest.
§ 2.903 Soliciting or Accepting Personal Gifts.
(A) A local official, employee or volunteer shall not solicit or accept any gift from any interested person, lobbyist, or principal who has a direct financial interest in a decision that the local official, employee or volunteer is authorized to make.

(9) Given by an interested person, lobbyist, or principal who is a related person to the recipient, unless the gift is given on behalf of someone who is not a related person.
(C) A local official, employee or volunteer who receives any gift prohibited by this section shall return, dispose of, or request that the City Council accept the gift on behalf of the City.
§ 2.904 Use of Official Position to Solicit Privileges or Special Treatment.
A local official, employee or volunteer shall not use his or her official position to solicit privileges or special treatment, unless the privileges or special treatment are for the benefit of the City.
§ 2.905 Statements of Economic Interest.

The City Council, as a whole, reserves unto itself to impose additional sanctions upon the local official including public reprimand and censure. Nothing in this section or any section shall be interpreted so far as to limit the public’s right to petition for recall of any elected public official.
(D) The disclosure statement of economic interest required by this Code of Ethics shall be signed and certified as true by the person required to file the report. Any person who
ADMINISTRATIVE
63

§ 2.98 OFFENSES.
(A) Purpose. Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this chapter are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of certain ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with administrative offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as is provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the procedures in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance with law. Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first instance. In the event a party participates in the administrative offense procedures but does not pay the monetary penalty which may be imposed, the city will seek to collect the costs of the administrative offense procedures as part of a subsequent criminal sentence in the event the party is charged and is adjudicated guilty of the criminal violation.
(B) Administrative offense defined. An administrative offense is a violation of a provision of this Code and is subject to the administrative penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses and penalties referred to in division (I) below.
(C) Notice. Any officer of the Fergus Falls Police Department or any other person employed by the city, authorized in writing by the City Administrator and having authority to enforce this code, shall, upon determining that there has been a violation, notify the violator, or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation. The notice shall set forth the nature, date and time of violation, the name of the official issuing the notice, and the amount of the scheduled penalty.
(D) Payment. Once notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule of penalties for the violation, or may request a hearing in writing, as is provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
(E) Hearing. Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this chapter may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, request a hearing by a hearing officer who shall forthwith conduct an informal hearing to determine if a violation has occurred. The hearing officer shall have authority to dismiss the violation or reduce or waive the penalty. If the violation is sustained by the hearing officer, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed.
ADMINISTRATIVE
65
(F) Hearing officer. A city employee designated in writing by the City Administrator shall be the hearing officer. The hearing officer is authorized to hear and determine any controversy relating to administrative offenses provided for in this chapter.
(G) Failure to pay. In the event a party charged with an administrative offense fails to pay the penalty, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought against the alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes and this code. If the penalty is paid or if an individual is found not to have committed the administrative offense by the hearing officer, no charge may be brought by the city for the same violation.
(H) Disposition of penalties. All penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the City Treasurer and may be deposited in the city’s general fund.
(I) Offenses and penalties. Offenses which may be charged as administrative offenses and the penalties for offenses may be established by resolution of the City Council from time to time. Copies of the resolutions shall be maintained in the office of the City Administrator.
(J) Subsequent offenses. In the event a party is charged with a subsequent administrative offense within a 12-month period of paying an administrative penalty for the same or substantially similar offense, the subsequent administrative penalty shall be increased by 25% above the previous administrative penalty.

The total revenue to be raised through FCC shall be in the same percentage to annual capital cost repayment as the fraction of flow and loading treatment capacity currently received at the treatment works. The FCC for participants in the industrial pretreatment program shall be based on their individual flow and loading capacity included in the treatment works capacity. The FCC for all other system users shall be determined at an amount proportional to water meter size. FCC’s for various water meter sizes are contained in Schedule A.
(2) The reserve capital charge (RCC) shall be an amount necessary to recover the capital costs associated with the portion of the treatment works capacity reserved for future use. The total revenue raised through RCC shall be the difference between the fixed annual capital cost repayment and the amount raised through FCC, and shall be apportioned to system users on the basis of their water meter size. The amount necessary to recover RCC and the RCC for each water meter size shall be determined at the beginning of each billing period. The RCC’s for various meter sizes under present plant loading conditions are given in Schedule B.
(3) The variable user charge shall be an amount necessary to recover the annual operation and maintenance costs of the treatment works. The user charge for all connections shall be based upon the flow and load characteristics of wastewater discharged by each user, as estimated by water meter readings, and shall be collected in a total amount sufficient to recover the annual operation and maintenance costs of the treatment works. The user charges for residential and commercial connections are contained in Schedule C. Each industrial unit of service shall be subject to appropriate metering and monitoring. The user charges for each industrial connection are contained in Schedule D.
(4) An industrial pretreatment charge is hereby imposed upon all industrial units of service subject to national and local industrial pretreatment standards. The industrial pretreatment charge shall be in the amount necessary to recover the administrative costs associated with permitting and monitoring the discharge of industrial wastewater into the treatment system. The costs of laboratory analyses of wastewater constituents shall be borne by each individual unit of service, respectively. Annual charges for participation in the industrial pretreatment program are contained in Schedule E.
UTILITIES

(5) Each user shall pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs in proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plan, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD, TSS and phosphorus being the rate established for concentrations of normal domestic strength wastewater.
(6) The Finance Director shall maintain a proper system of accounts suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment replacement and debt retirement costs of the treatment works and shall furnish the Council with a report of the costs annually.
(7) The Council shall annually determine whether or not sufficient revenue is being generated for the effective operation, maintenance, replacement and management of the treatment works, and whether sufficient revenue is being generated for debt retirement. The Council will also determine whether the user charges are distributed proportionately to each user in accordance with this section and section 204(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended. The city shall thereafter, but not later than December, reassess and as necessary revise the sewer service charge system then in use to insure the proportionality of the user charges and to insure the sufficiency of funds to maintain the capacity and performance to which the facilities were constructed, and to retire the construction debt.
(D) Rates and charges.
(1) Charges and rates shall be made against each lot, parcel of land or premises which may have an active sewer connection with the wastewater disposal system or which may otherwise discharge wastewater either directly or indirectly into the system or any part thereof. The charges and rates shall be based upon the quantity of wastewater discharged thereon or therein as the quantity may be measured by wastewater flow meters or the water meter serving the lot, parcel of land or premises.
(2) Occupants of any lot, parcel of land or premises discharging into the sanitary sewer but not using city water wholly or partly shall, at their own expense, be required to install meters or other measuring devices approved by the City Engineer to measure either the water used or the discharge to the sanitary sewer. Occupants of any lot, parcel of land or premises desiring credit for water consumed for purposes where the water is not returned to the sanitary sewer, must at their own expense, separately meter the water for the uses.
(3) Charges for residential sewer service shall be based on a “winter quarter” meter reading. The “winter quarter” meter reading shall include three of the following months as shall be designated by the Council: November, December, January, February and March. The amount of wastewater discharged in the “winter quarter” shall be used to compute the quarterly charge for each residential user and the charge shall apply for the remaining three quarters of the year. Charges for commercial and industrial sewer service shall be based on the metered wastewater flow measured quarterly.
(4) For any lot, parcel of land or premises from which connection is made with the wastewater disposal system, or which discharges wastewater into the wastewater disposal system,
UTILITIES

(10) (a) Monitoring facilities to allow inspections, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems shall be provided and operated by all significant industrial users or other industrial user which may have a significant effect as determined by the City Engineer. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, the City Engineer may, when a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for
UTILITIES
38
analysis. The facility, sampling and measurement equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
(b) Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City Engineer’s requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the City Engineer, unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may in certain cases elect to delegate to the city the responsibilities for sampling or monitoring the wastewater from an industry if the City Engineer and the industry are in agreement, in which case total costs to the city for monitoring and sampling will be assessed to the industry.
(11) All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this section shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with EPA approved methods contained in 40 CFR 136 to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater disposal system and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH is determined from periodic grab samples.)
(12) No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern, providing that federal categorical, prohibited discharge or NPDES permit limitations are not violated. The user pays operation, maintenance and replacement costs in proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at a rate less than that of “Normal Domestic Strength Wastewater.”
(13) Any person, owner, lessee or occupant, and any plumber or building contractor who has heretofore made or permitted to be made, or shall hereafter make or permit to be made, any connection to the sanitary system for the purpose of discharging into the system the substances described in this division shall immediately remove the connection. If the connection is not removed within 15 days after notice of the violation delivered personally to the person, owner, lessee or occupant or posted on the premises where the violation may occur, the Council may order the City Engineer to cause the connection to be removed at the expense of the city, and the expense of the removal shall be assessed against the premises and certified to the County Auditor of Otter Tail County for collection in the same manner as other special assessments, and the same shall become a lien on the property until paid. Any person, owner, lessee, occupant, plumber or
UTILITIES
39
building contractor may in addition be prosecuted for having committed a misdemeanor.
(G) Liability.
(1) Each user or owner shall be responsible for cleaning the sewer connection from the house or building to the sewer main. The city shall maintain the sewer main and interceptor lines as well as the service pipe installed within its public right of way. The city shall not be liable for any stoppages in the sewers or services. Each user should provide a suitable back water valve to prevent flooding of basements in the event of sewer stoppage.
(2) Any sewer connection that is abandoned for non-use or found not to meet all requirements of this section shall be disconnected and plugged at the sewer location by a means acceptable to the City Engineer. All costs and expenses incidental to disconnecting the building sewer shall be borne by the owner.
(H) Industrial user reports. The City Engineer may require that any industrial user discharging or proposing to discharge wastewater to the wastewater disposal system file a periodic discharge report. The discharge report may include, but not be limited to, nature of process, rates of flow, mass discharge rate, raw material and production quantities, hours of operation, number and classification of employees, compliance status with any state or federal pretreatment standards or other information which relates to the generation of waste, including wastewater constituents and characteristics in the wastewater discharge. Reports may also include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid or gaseous materials stored on site, even though they may not normally be discharged. At a minimum, a summary of the data indicating each industrial user’s compliance with this section shall be prepared quarterly and submitted to the City Engineer. In addition to discharge reports, the City Engineer may require information in the form of wastewater discharge permit applications, self-monitoring reports and compliance schedules.
(I) Wastewater discharge permits.

(4) Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the City Engineer during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his or her permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(5) Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to
UTILITIES
42
a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation without the approval of the City Engineer. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit.
(J) Pretreatment. Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with this section and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City Engineer shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review, and shall be acceptable to the City Engineer before construction of the facility. The review of the plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City Engineer under the provisions of this section. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City Engineer prior to the user’s initiation of the changes. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available by the City Engineer to officials of the EPA or MPCA upon request.
(K) Confidential information. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the release of the information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this section, the NPDES permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that the portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be regarded as confidential information. Information accepted by the City Engineer as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the City Engineer until and unless a ten day notification is given to the user.
(L) Sludges generated. Sludges, floats, skimmings, and the like, generated by an industrial or commercial pretreatment system shall not be placed into the wastewater disposal system. The sludges shall be contained, transported and disposed of by haulers in accordance with all federal, state and local regulations.
(M) Slug or accidental discharges.

UTILITIES
43
system and the receiving waters. The notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater disposal system or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under any state or federal law. The City Engineer may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when the suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City Engineer, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of person, the environment, or to the wastewater disposal system, or would cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES or state disposal system per any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop the discharge.
(2) In event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City Engineer shall take the steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater discharge system or endangerment to any individuals. The Engineer shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service proof of the elimination of the noncompliance discharge. A detailed written statement submitted to the user describing the causes of the slug or accidental discharge and the measures taken prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City Engineer within 15 days of the date of occurrence. Any additional costs caused discharges to the treatment works of toxics or of incompatible wastes, including the cost of restoring wastewater treatment services, clean up and restoration of the receiving waters and environs and slug disposal, shall be borne by the discharger(s) of wastes, at no expense to the city.
(N) Revocation of permit. The Engineer may revoke the permit of any industrial which fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his or her discharge which fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics; which reasonable access to the user’s premises for purpose of inspection or monitoring; or for violations of conditions of its permit, this section and applicable state and federal regulations.
(O) Notification of violation. Whenever the City Engineer finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this section, wastewater discharge permit or any prohibit limitation or requirement contained herein, the Engineer may serve upon the person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to city by the user.
(P) Public notification of violators. At a minimum frequency of once a year, the city shall publish in the city’s newspaper, a list of industrial users in violation of their discharge permits and descriptions of enforcement action taken in each case.
(Q) Show cause hearing for industrial users.
(1) Notice of hearing. If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the City Engineer may order any user which causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show cause before the Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Council regarding
UTILITIES
44
the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
(2) Hearing officials. The Council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the city to:
(a) Issue in the name of the Council notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in the hearing;
(b) Take the evidence; and
(c) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Council for action thereon.
(3) Transcripts. At any hearing held pursuant to this section, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
(4) Issuance of orders. After the Council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances shall have been installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
(R) Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this section, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the City Attorney may, following the authorization of the action by the Council, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief.

STORM WATER
§ 3.93 STORM WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY.
(A) Establishment. Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, the city establishes a storm drainage utility and authorizes the imposition of just and reasonable charges for the use and availability of storm drainage facilities. The storm drainage utility operations shall be a part of the Public Works Department and under the administration of the City Administrator.
(B) Finding and Determination.
(1) In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a storm drainage system. This section is adopted in the further exercise of the authority and for the same purposes.
(2) The system, as constructed heretofore, has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an additional method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing, repairing, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of charges as provided in this section.
(3) In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering
system costs, the topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing, repairing, maintaining and operating the system on the basis of the expected storm water runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard rainfall event.
(C) Storm Drainage Utility Fund. There is hereby created a Storm Drainage Utility Fund into which all charges, when collected, and all monies received from the sale of any facilities or equipment or any by-products shall be placed. The monies shall be used first to pay the normal, reasonable and current costs of operating and maintaining the facilities.
(D) Runoff equivalent factor (REF) defined. For the purpose of this section, “runoff equivalent factor (REF)” is defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff generated by one acre of a given land use to the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of typical single-family residential land, during a standard one year rainfall event.
UTILITIES
46
(E) Storm water drainage charges. In determining charges, the City Council shall by resolution establish a basic system rate to be charged monthly against one standardized or measured drainage unit having an REF of one. The charge to be made against each parcel of land shall then be determined by multiplying the REF for the parcel’s land use, classification times the parcel’s drainage unit times the basic system rate. The REF values for various land uses are as follows:
Class. Land Use REF
1
Single-family and duplex residential
1.00
2
Small commercial
2.00
3
Large commercial,
industrial, institutional,
churches, and the like
4.00
4
Parks, cemeteries and
vacant land
0.00
(F) Drainage units.
(1) Standardized drainage unit (Classification 1). For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage charges, all Classification 1 land use parcels shall be considered to have one drainage unit per residence (duplex, two residences).
(2) Standardized drainage unit (Classification 2). For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage charges, all Classification 2 land use parcels shall be considered to have one drainage unit per business (maximum parcel size = half an acre).
(3) Measured drainage unit (Classification 3). For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage charges, all Classification 3 land use parcels shall be considered to have one drainage unit for each one acre of measured impermeable surface (roofs, parking lots, and the like) located on the parcel (minimum parcel size = half an acre).
(G) Other land uses. Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified by the City Administrator by assigning them to classes most nearly like the listed uses, from the standpoint of runoff volume for the standard rainfall event. An appeal of the classifications from the determination of the City Administrator may be made to the City Council.
(H) Adjustment of charge. The City Council may by resolution adopt policies providing for
UTILITIES
47
the adjustment of charges for parcels based upon land use data supplied by affected property owners which demonstrates a runoff volume for a standard rainfall event substantially different from the REF being used for the parcels. The adjustments for storm water drainage charges shall not be made retroactively.
(I) Exemptions. Public street rights-of-way, cemeteries, parks and vacant land with ground cover are exempt from storm water drainage charges.
(J) Payment of charge. Statements for storm water drainage charges shall be made a part of the present utility billing system invoiced through the City Administrator’s office on a monthly basis
. All charges shall be subject to established procedure for determining and collecting customer charges.
(K) Late payment penalty. Each billing for storm water drainage charges which are not paid when due shall incur a penalty charge of 10% of the amount past due.
(L) Establishment of tax lien. Any past due storm water drainage charges will be certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate taxes against the property served by the utility established in this section for collection as other taxes are collected in the following year pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to time, and the code. In addition, the city may have the right to bring a civil action or take other legal remedies to collect unpaid charges.
(Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-96)
§3.94 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
(A) Purpose. This section outlines the requirements for storm water management systems within the City of Fergus Falls. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this section or other regulations adopted by the City of Fergus Falls, State of Minnesota or Federal authorities, the more restrictive standard prevails. The objectives of this section are as follows:
(1) To protect the natural resources within the City of Fergus Falls from undesirable impacts related to development or other activities.
(2) To promote the safety of people and property through effective storm water quantity and quality management practices.
(3) To regulate land development activity, land disturbing activity, or other activities that may have an adverse impact on storm water quantity or quality.
(4) To establish standards and procedures for land development activities throughout the City of Fergus Falls, which balance development and the protection of water quality.
(5) To provide the basis for storm water system analysis necessary to protect public and private property, water quality and existing natural resources.
UTILITIES
48
(6) To comply with the requirements of the City’s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System’s (NPDES) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit and associated Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program (SWPPP).
Except as otherwise provided herein, the City Engineer shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
(B) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms, phrases, and words, and their derivatives, shall have the following meaning.
APPLICANT. Any person or group that applies for a building permit, subdivision approval, zoning change, approach, excavation or special use permit, storm water plan approval, or any other permit which allows land disturbing activities.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP). Erosion and sediment control and water quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing the degradation of surface water, including; construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed, prohibitions, and other management practices published by federal, state, or designated area-wide planning agencies.
BMP's. Measures designed to 1) prevent pollutants from leaving a specific area; 2) reduce/eliminate the introduction of pollutants; 3) protect sensitive areas or 4) prevent the interaction between precipitation and pollutants. A protective vegetated zone located adjacent to a natural resource, such as a water of the state that is subject to direct or indirect human alteration. Such a buffer strip is an integral part of protecting an aquatic ecosystem through trapping sheet erosion, filtering pollutants, reducing channel erosion and providing adjacent habitat.
BUFFER. The buffer strip begins at the "ordinary high water mark" for wetlands and the top of the bank of the channel for rivers and streams. This start point corresponds to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' definition of a "shoreline" in Minnesota Rules 6115.0030 or as may be amended from time to time.
CITY. The City of Fergus Falls or the City Council of the City of Fergus Falls.
CITY ENGINEER. The City Engineer of the City of Fergus Falls or authorized agent. The City Engineer may require a third party Engineer's service at the applicant’s expense.
COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. A contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at different times, or on different schedules, but under one proposed plan. This item is broadly defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or physical demarcation indicating that land disturbing activities may occur.
CONTROL MEASURE. A practice or combination of practices to control erosion and attendant pollution, see also Best Management Practices.
COUNCIL. The City Council of the City of Fergus Falls.
DETENTION FACILITY. A natural or manmade structure, including wetlands, used for the temporary storage of runoff and which may contain a permanent pool of water, or
UTILITIES
49
may be dry during times of no runoff.
DEVELOPMENT. Any land disturbance activity that changes the site's runoff characteristics in conjunction with residential, commercial, industrial or institutional construction or alteration.
DEVELOPER. A person, firm, corporation, sole proprietorship, partnership, federal or state agency, or political subdivision thereof engaged in a land disturbance and/or land development activity.
DISCHARGE. The release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage, of storm water, including snowmelt.
DRAINAGE EASEMENT. A right to use the land of another for a specific purpose, such as a right-of-way for the movement of water across or under the land surface or the storage of water.
EROSION. Removing the surface of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can be accelerated by the activities of man and nature.
EROSION CONTROL. Refers to methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or permanent cover, and construction phasing.
EROSION & SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN (E&S CONTROL PLAN). A written description and/or plan indicating the number, locations, sizes, and other pertinent information about best management practice methods designed to reduce erosion of the land surface and the deposition of sediment within a waterway. An E&S Control Plan is required as part of a Storm Water Management Plan. Both the Storm Water Management Plan and E&S Control Plans are used in developing the State mandated Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). An E&S Control Plan may be required for certain projects not requiring a full Storm Water Management Plan, as outlined in this ordinance or determined necessary by the City Engineer.
EXPOSED SOIL AREAS. All areas of the construction site where the vegetation (trees, shrubs, brush, grasses, etc.) or impervious surface has been removed, thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion. This includes topsoil stockpile areas, borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site. It does not include temporary stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand, gravel, concrete or bituminous, which have less stringent protection. Once soil is exposed, it is considered "exposed soil," until it meets the definition of "final stabilization."
FINAL STABILIZATION. Means that all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed, and that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy (70) percent of the cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered final stabilization. Where agricultural land is involved, such as when pipelines are built on crop or rangeland, final stabilization constitutes returning the land to its preconstruction agricultural use.
HYDRIC SOILS. Soils that are saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil profile.
HYDROPHYTIC VEGETATION. Macrophytic (large enough to be observed by the naked eye) plant life growing in water, soil, or on a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content.
UTILITIES
50
IMPERVIOUS AREA. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil, and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than existed prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas; and concrete, asphalt, or gravel parking lots and roads.
LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. The act of subdivision or platting properties for personal use, adding value or for the purposes of resale. This includes the construction and/or demolition of buildings, structures, roads, parking lots, paved storage areas, and similar facilities.
LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY. Any land change that may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands within the City's jurisdiction, including construction, clearing & grubbing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. Within the context of this ordinance, land disturbance activity does not mean:
(1) Minor land disturbance activities such as home gardens and an individual's home landscaping, repairs, and maintenance work, which will not result in sediments entering the storm water system.
(2) Additions or modifications to existing single family structures that result in creating under five thousand (5,000) square feet of exposed soil or impervious surface and will not result in sediments entering the storm water system.
(3) Construction, installation, and maintenance of trees, fences, signs, posts, poles, and electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines or individual service connections to these utilities, which result in creating under five thousand (5,000) square feet of exposed soil or impervious surface and will not result in sediments entering the storm water system.
(4) Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or silvicultural (forestry) crops.
(5) Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency repairs, unless the land disturbing activity would have otherwise required an approved erosion and sediment control plan, except for the emergency. If such a plan would have been required, then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the City's requirements as soon as possible.
LANDOWNER. Any person holding title to or having a divided or undivided interest in land.
LOCAL DETENTION. Detention intended to serve only the developing area in question and no areas outside of the development boundaries. As such it is under the control of one owner or group of owners. This is also known as on-site detention.
LOCAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM. The storm drainage system which transports the minor and major storm water runoff to the major storm water system serving only the property within the development boundaries, under the control of one owner or group of owners. This is also known as the on-site drainage system.
MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. A practice or combination of practices to control erosion and water quality degradation.
UTILITIES

(L) Storm Water Management Criteria for New and Redeveloped Permanent Facilities.. Storm water control facilities included as part of the final design for a Permanent Development; shall be addressed in the Storm Water Management Plan and shall meet the following criteria:
(1) Pre Versus Post Hydrological Response of Site. An applicant shall design, install or construct, on or for the proposed land disturbing activity, development activity, or redevelopment activity, all storm water management facilities necessary to manage runoff such that increases in flow under the design conditions will not occur that could exceed the capacity of the Outlet, or the Storm Water Management System, into which the site discharges or that would cause the Storm Water Management System to be overloaded or accelerate channel erosion as a result of the proposed land disturbing activity or development activity. Under no circumstances shall the 2, 10, or 100-year developed peak flow exceed the 2, 10, or 100-year existing peak flow without prior written approval by the City Engineer. Post Construction Stormwater Management BMPs shall be installed to the Maximum Extent Practical (MEP) and shall show a net reduction for volume, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Total Phosphorus (TP) for new or redeveloped sites from pre-project conditions. For Regional Detention or Storm Water Management System, the City Engineer shall recommend a proposed System Charge or Assessment to be approved by the City Council based upon an approved Watershed Master Plan and an analysis of required drainage systems, projected costs and flood protection benefits provided to those properties directly or indirectly impacted by the Regional Detention or Storm Water Management System.
(2) Natural Features of the Site. The applicant shall give consideration to reducing the need for Storm Water Management System facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as wetlands, ponds, natural swales and depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional water flow without compromising the integrity or quality of these natural features.
(3) Storm Water Management Strategies. The following Storm Water Management practices shall be investigated when developing a Storm Water Management Plan in accordance with this section and the Fergus Falls City Code:
(a) Natural infiltration of precipitation and runoff on-site, if suitable soil profiles can be created during site grading. The purpose of this strategy is to encourage the development of a Storm Water Management Plan that encourages natural infiltration. This includes, providing as much natural or vegetated area on the site as possible, minimizing impervious surfaces, and directing runoff to vegetated areas rather than onto adjoining streets, storm sewers and ditches;
(b) Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions;
(c) Storm Water Detention facilities;
(d) Storm Water Retention facilities (on a case by case basis); and,
(e) Other facilities requested by the City Engineer.
A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control requirements specified. Justification shall be provided by the applicant for the method selected, except as provided in Stormwater management “limitations” noted in the State NPDES General Permit.
(4) Adequacy of Outlets. The adequacy of any Outlet used as a discharge point for proposed Storm Water Management System must be assessed and documented to
UTILITIES
60
the satisfaction of the City Engineer. To the extent practicable, hydraulic capacities of downstream natural channels, storm sewer systems, or streets shall be evaluated to determine if they have sufficient conveyance capacity to receive and accommodate post-development runoff discharges and volumes. In addition, projected velocities in downstream natural or manmade channels shall not exceed that which is reasonably anticipated to cause erosion unless protective measures acceptable to the City Engineer are approved and installed as part of the Storm Water Management Plan. The assessment of Outlet adequacy shall be included in the Storm Water Management Plan.
(5) Storm Water Detention/Retention Facilities. Storm Water Detention or Retention facilities proposed to be constructed in the Storm Water Management Plan shall be designed according to the most current practices as reflected in the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program study.
(6) Pond Buffers. A pond buffer extending 20 feet outward and 2 feet up from the high water level must be provided around the entire pond. The Developer must provide signs denoting pond buffer limits as deemed necessary and as approved by the City. Deviations from this standard will only be allowed with prior review and approval from the City.
(M) Operation, Maintenance and Inspection. All Storm Water Management Systems shall be designed to minimize the need for maintenance, to provide easy vehicle (typically eight (8) feet or wider) and personnel access for maintenance purposes, and to be structurally sound. All Storm Water Management Systems shall have a plan of operation and maintenance that assures continued effective removal of pollutants carried in Storm Water Runoff. The City Engineer may inspect all public and private Storm Water Management Systems at any time. Inspection records will be kept on file at the City Engineer's Office. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the Storm Water Management System for inspection and maintenance purposes. The owner must perform routine maintenance and inspections that are required annually and includes mowing grass, controlling weeds and woody vegetation, repairing eroded areas, and removing debris. A ponds buffer should be maintained as a meadow, prairie or forest with no more than two mowings annually at a height of no less than 4 inches. The owner must perform nonroutine maintenance which includes sediment cleanout and major structural repairs when needed. Inspections for nonroutine maintenance items must occur at a minimum of every five years. Sediment cleanout must occur when 50 percent of the permanent pool storage volume is sediment. The City Engineer shall retain enforcement powers for assuring adequate operation and maintenance activities through permit conditions, penalties, noncompliance orders and fees.
(N) Easements. Easements may be required as conditions to the issuance of a Storm Water Management Plan approval. If a Storm Water Management Plan involves directing some or all of the site's runoff to a drainage easement, the applicant or his designated representative shall obtain from the property owners any necessary easements or other property interests concerning the flowing of such water. No fill, structures, fences, walls, rip-rap, buildings, docks, bridges, fountains or other similar encumbrances to access or restrictions to the flow of water may be placed within the drainage easement without the prior written consent of the City.
(O) Plan Applicability. A Storm Water Management Plan approval issued under this section runs with the land and is a condition of plat or development approval. Any Landowner or subsequent Landowner of any parcel within the plat or development area must comply with the plan or any approval, condition, revision or modification of the Plan.
UTILITIES
61
The Landowner must also comply with all applicable State Subdivision Registration, Permit Transfer/Modification and Notice of Termination Permits and provide a copy of the permit applications to the City for approval. Failure to comply with this Plan shall constitute a violation and subject the Permittee, Developer, and/or Landowner to the enforcement provisions, penalties and noncompliance fees.
(P) Plan Amendment. Storm Water Management Plans may be amended only by a written request submitted to the City Engineer. This request shall contain the reason for the change and documentation related to any additional change in projected impacts, which may result from amendment approval. Amendment requests submitted prior to final approval of a plan application shall be considered part of the original submittal. Amendment requests filed after Plan approval shall be considered following the same procedures as if it were a new application and subject to applicable review periods.
(Q) NPDES Permits. It is unlawful to initiate any land development activity, land disturbing activity, or other activities which may result in an increase in storm water quantities, degradation of storm water quality, or restriction of flow in any storm sewer system, open ditch or natural channel, storm water easement, water body, or wetland outlet within the jurisdiction of the City, without having first complied with the terms of this section. Other activities include those outlined in paragraph (C) of this section.
(1) Permit. All persons subject to meeting the requirements and needing to obtain a NPDES permit shall apply for coverage and file a copy with the City Engineer. The permit will be accompanied by a Storm Water Management Plan as prescribed under the Storm Water Management Plan Application and Review section of this section, if such a plan has not been previously approved. Permit applications may be denied if the applicant is not in compliance with the NPDES permit currently in effect. Commencing earthwork on a project prior to plan or permit approval is considered a violation of this section.
(2) Permit Delays. The City Engineer may withhold granting approval of a Permit until all issues associated with the site are resolved to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. Permits may be conditioned with delays such that work cannot begin until a specified date or until after the site is inspected.
(3) Permit Amendments. NPDES Permits may be amended (by applicant) only by a written request submitted by the Permittee to the State. This request shall contain the reason for the change and documentation related to any additional impacts, which may result from amendment approval. A copy of the request will be submitted to the City Engineer within seven days of the submittal to the State. The State approved amended permit will also be submitted to the City Engineer within seven days of receipt.
(4) Permit Transfer. A NPDES permit runs with the property it covers, until the permitted activities are completed, and is transferable to new Landowners in its entirety or by parcel, with each parcel being subject to the permit and any conditions, which apply to that parcel. Land transfers must be reported to the City Engineer prior to issuing of permits.
(5) Inspection. The City Engineer may inspect the Storm Water Management System of any Permittee to determine compliance with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall promptly allow the City and their authorized representatives, upon presentation of credentials to:

§4.14. POSSESSION AND SALE OF TOBACCO AND RELATED DEVICES AND
THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICES.
(A). PURPOSE AND INTENT. Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products, and the sales, possession, and use are violations of both state and federal laws; and because
BUSINESS REGULATIONS
7
studies, which the city hereby accepts and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because tobacco use has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government; this ordinance shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products, and to further the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
Unregulated electronic delivery devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or other substances created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing a number of e-cigarettes from two leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA’s testing also suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent. (“Summary of results: Laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted by FDA, “Food and Drug Administration (FDA), July 22, 2009. E-cigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions.
In making these findings, the City Council accepts the conclusions and recommendations of Center for Disease Control in their study “Selected Cigarette Smoking Initiation and Quitting Behaviors Among High School Students, United States, 1997,” and of the following medical professionals in these medical journals: Khuder SA, et al., “Age at Smoking Onset and its Effect on Smoking Cessation,” Addictive Behavior 24(5):673-7, September-October 1999; D’Avanzo B, et al., “Age at Starting Smoking and Number of Cigarettes Smoked,” Annals of Epidemiology 4(6):455-59, November 1994; Chen, J & Millar, WJ, “Age of Smoking Initiation: Implications for Quitting,” Health Reports 9(4):39-46, Spring 1998; Everett SA, et al., “Initiation of Cigarette Smoking and Subsequent Smoking Behavior Among U.S. High School Students,” Preventive Medicine, 29(5):327-33, November 1999, copies of which are adopted by reference.
(B) DEFINITIONS. Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

§ 4.32 ADULT USES AND ENTERTAINMENT.
(A) Statement of policy.
(1) The City Council deems it necessary to provide for the special and express regulation of businesses or commercial enterprises which operate as adult body painting studios, adult bookstores, adult cabarets, adult companionship establishments, adult hotels or motels, adult massage parlors or health clubs, adult mini-motion picture theaters, adult modeling studios, adult motion picture arcades or theaters, adult novelty businesses, adult saunas and similar adult-oriented services operating under different names in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and to guard against the inception and transmission of disease. The City Council further finds that the commercial enterprises such as the types described above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized training, are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening, subverting or endangering the morals of the community by being the site of acts of prostitution, illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes, and thus requiring close inspection, licensing and regulation.
(2) The City Council also finds that control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types, in view of the abuses often perpetrated, require intensive efforts by the Police Department and other departments of the city. As a consequence, the concentrated use of city services in control detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare, morals and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide numerous services to all segments of the community without a concentration of public services in one area working to the detriment of the members of the general public, it is hereby decided that adult use principal should be limited to the B-2 district as a conditional use and that adult use accessory should be limited to the B-2 service business district and B-3 general business district as a permitted use and should require the issuance of licenses.

83
rental unit, or the property in or on which it is located, is detrimental to the public health, sanitation, safety and general welfare of the community at large, or residents of the rental units go as to constitute a nuisance, fire hazard, or other unsafe or dangerous condition and thus give rise to an emergency, the City Administrator shall have the authority to summarily condemn or close individual rental units or such areas of the rental dwelling as the Administrator deems necessary. Notice of summary condemnation shall be posted at the units or areas affected. No person shall remove the posted notice, other than the Fire Inspector, City Administrator, or their designated representative. Any person aggrieved by the decision or the action of the City Administrator or Fire Inspector set out in this Subdivision, may appeal the decision following the procedures set out in this Ordinance.

(2) Violation of this Ordinance is a misdemeanor. Each separate day on which a continuing violation occurs is a separate violation.
(P) Written Notices. Notices from the City required by this Ordinance shall be effective if personally delivered or if mailed to the addresses by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address shown in the City file pertaining to the rental unit involved in the notice.

This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its rights of way or to be placed therein at some future time.

M. Right of Way Patching and Restoration.
1. Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration of the right of way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Section 1.17.
2. Patch and Restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right of way or to restore the right of way itself.
(a) City Restoration. If the city restores the right of way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within thirty (30) days of billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee’s improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the defective work.
(b) Permittee Restoration. If the permittee restores the right of way itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule 7819.3000.

19
rights under the construction performance bond.
N. Joint Applications.
1. Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the right of way at the same place and time.
2. Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
3. With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a permit would still be required.
O. Supplementary Applications.
1. Limitation on Area. A right of way permit is valid only for the area of the right of way specified in the permit.

(b) The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to Sec. 1.23.
T. Work Done Without a Permit.
1. Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two (2) business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
2. Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right of way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right of way, and comply with all of the
22
requirements of this chapter.
U. Supplementary Notification. If the obstruction or excavation of the right of way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
V. Revocation of Permits.
1. Substantial Breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right of way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(a) The violation of any material provision of the right of way permit.
(b) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right of way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens.
(c) Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right of way permit.
(d) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee’s control.
(e) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec. 1.20.
2. Written Notice of Breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
3. Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable
23
plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one (1) full year.
4. Cause for Probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right of way grossly outside of the permit authorization.
5. Automatic Revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
6. Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
W. Mapping Data.
1. Information Required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. R. 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within ninety (90) days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
2. Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. R. 7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
(a) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including those under Minn. Stat. ch. 429, and
(b) city approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minn. Stat. ch. 462. The director shall reasonably determine
24
the appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
X. Location and Relocation of Facilities.
1. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. R. 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
2. Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other agreement between the applicable right of way user and the City, Facilities in the right of way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in accordance with Section _____ of the City Code.
3. Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right of way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right of way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right of way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right of way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the registrant.
4. Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right of way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right of way to a useable condition.
5. Limitation of Space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or when necessary to protect the right of way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right of way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right of way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
25
public interest.
Y. Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. In addition to complying with the requirements of Minn. Stat. 216D.01-.09 (“One Call Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any right of way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than twenty (20) inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
Z. Damage to Other Facilities. When the city does work in the right of way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right of way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
AA. Right of Way Vacation.
1. Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right of way that contains the facilities of a registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right of way are governed by Minn. R. 7819.3200.
BB. Indemnification and Liability. By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule 7819.1250.
CC. Abandoned and Unusable Facilities.
1. Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its facilities in the right of way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another registrant.
2. Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right of way shall remove it from that right of way if required in conjunction with other right of way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.
DD. Appeal. A right of way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the director regarding Section 1.24, subd.2 of this ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the right
26
of way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
EE. Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. A permittee’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances as necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
FF. Severability. If any portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

All applications shall contain an agreement by the applicant to be bound by this chapter and, as to roadway and curb and gutter improvements, plans and specifications consistent with the provisions of this chapter and good engineering practices shall also accompany the application. A permit from the city shall not relieve the holder from damages to the person or property of another caused by the work. Provided, that no permit shall be required for any improvement installed as a part of a city project, or when the improvement is part of a building project for which plans have been submitted and for which a building permit has been issued.
(C) Specifications and regulations. All sidewalks and curb and gutter constructed in or upon any street or other public property shall be constructed according to the specifications duly adopted as herein provided.

Any work not done according to the plans and specifications, including the specifications herein provided for, shall be removed and corrected at the expense of the permit holder. Any work done hereunder may be stopped by the City Engineer
29
if found to be unsatisfactory, but this shall not place a burden upon the city to continually inspect or supervise the work.
(G) Policy for sidewalk, curb and gutter construction. It is hereby made the duty of all owners of land abutting on any street or avenue in the city, to construct, reconstruct and maintain in good repair sidewalks, curb and gutters along any street or avenue in accordance with the current established policy on file in the office of the City Engineer.
(1) A sidewalk plan for the city shall be developed by the City Engineer and adopted by resolution of the Council and which may be amended from time to time in the same manner. Sidewalks will be classified as arterial, collector or local as defined below. This classification will be used to determine the priority for construction and repair: arterials, first; collectors, second; local sidewalks, third. A map of the approved arterial and collector sidewalk routes will be kept on file in the office of the City Engineer. All sidewalks on public rights-of-way shall be concrete constructed according to the standards on file in the City Engineer’s office, five feet in width, and be located with the inside edge of the sidewalk one foot outside the property line where parallel to private frontage.

No new local sidewalks are required unless petitioned by affected landowners and approved by the Council, or initiated and approved by the Council. Isolated segments of local sidewalks, abutting on only one landowner, may be removed if requested by the landowner with permission of the City Engineer. Removal of local sidewalks abutting on more than one landowner requires a petition signed by all abutting landowners and approved by the Council.
(d) Exemptions.
1. The City Engineer is hereby empowered to reduce or increase the width of sidewalk where it is deemed in the best interest of the public.
2. The City Engineer is hereby empowered to exempt properties from the requirement that the sidewalk be constructed with the inside edge one foot outside the property line when upon investigation he or she determines that:
a. Healthy specimen trees of two inches or greater diameter would be destroyed.
30
b. Sidewalk alignment within a block would be different from existing walks within the block.
c. Severe grade problems would result.
3. The City Engineer is hereby empowered to postpone construction of walks required until the time of street construction when a lot or lots abut an unimproved (lacking curb and gutter) street that is expected to be scheduled for improvement at some future date and when in his or her opinion a delay of construction to coincide with street construction would be advisable.
4. Residential type “house walks” (generally perpendicular to the sidewalk or street) on public right-of-way are installed and reconstructed at the option and full expense of the landowner, are exempt from width requirements, are not included in the sidewalk classification (arterial, collector, local), but do require a permit for construction or reconstruction.
(2) City to construct, reconstruct and maintain sidewalks, curbs and gutters.
(a) If required sidewalks, curbs and gutters are not constructed within the time limits established by the city, or whenever the city shall deem it necessary and expedient to construct, rebuild or repair any of the foregoing, it may adopt a resolution to the effect, which resolution shall specify the place or places where the improvement shall be constructed, rebuilt or repaired, the size and manner of construction thereof, and the time within which the same shall be completed. The resolution shall contain the names of the owners of all lots, parts of lots and parcels of ground fronting the street or streets where the improvement or construction is to be constructed, rebuilt or repaired.

The resolution shall be served by registered mail or by personal service upon the record owner of the property, and the occupant, if the owner does not reside in the city or cannot be found therein, ordering the owner to have the sidewalks, curb or gutter repaired and made safe within 30 days and stating that if the owner fails to do so, the Council will have the same done, and that the expense thereof must be paid by the owner, and that if unpaid, it will be made special assessment against the property concerned.
(c) If the requested improvement is not made within 30 days after the receipt of the notice, the Council shall by resolution order the construction made. If the construction, reconstruction or repair not be made within the time prescribed in the resolution, then the Council may order the same to be done, under the supervision of the City Engineer, by day labor or cause the same to be done by contract to the lowest responsible bidder, the entire expenses thereof to be paid out of the funds as the city shall designate.
31
(d) If the construction, reconstruction or maintenance work is performed by the city, as set forth above, the City Administrator shall forthwith upon completion thereof, ascertain the cost attributable to each lot, piece or parcel of abutting land. The City Administrator shall, at the next regular meeting thereof, present the certificate to the Council and obtain its approval thereof. When the certificate has been approved it shall be extended as to the cost therein stated as a special assessment shall, at the time of certifying taxes to the County Auditor, be certified for collection as other special assessments are certified and collected.
(e) Division of costs of construction and reconstruction.
1. All costs of portions of sidewalks crossing private driveways (driveway sections) shall be the obligation of the property owner. Where new sidewalk construction occurs along a street having existing curb and gutter a six- inch thick un-reinforced concrete driveway approach slab, meeting the standards on file in the City Engineer’s office, is required between the sidewalk and the gutter at the full expense of the landowner.
2. For all sidewalks abutting private property the assessed cost, excluding the cost of driveway sections, shall be a price per linear foot adopted by a resolution of the Council, and which may be amended in the same manner, if the work is done by the city. The resolution, containing the effective date thereof, shall be kept on file in the office of the City Administrator. For walks damaged by city trees, see division 4., below. If the work is done by a licensed paving contractor, see division 5., below. For sidewalks abutting public property, see division 7., below.
3. The city will pay the cost of all necessary crosswalks, and other walks not abutting on at least one side upon private property, if the work is done by the city or by a licensed paving contractor. (See division 5 below.)
4. Small segments (up to 12 feet in length) of sidewalk abutting private property which are in good condition, except for damage caused exclusively by the growth of trees on city property or right-of-way will be repaired at city cost if approved in advance by the City Engineer and the work is done by the city.
5. City participation in eligible work done by a licensed paving contractor shall be limited to a price set by the City Engineer.
6. All other costs will be the obligation of the property owner.
7. For all sidewalks abutting public (including federal, state, county, city, public school district, and the like) property, the full cost shall be assessed to or paid by the owner.
(f) It is not the intent of this division to, in any manner, limit the use of the procedures and methods set forth in Local Improvement Code of Minnesota Statutes, presently beginning with § 429.011, as the same may from time to time be amended. This division is intended to be an addition and separate procedure to construct, reconstruct or repair sidewalks, curbs and gutters.

(5) Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the Director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the Director, the Director at its option may do the work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond.
(6) Degradation fee in lieu of restoration.

A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
(3) Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.

reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the revocation.

(3) Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Director shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions, the Director shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
(Q) Damage to other facilities. When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move facilities to protect it, the Director shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible and placed as required. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each facility owner shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damages.

The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee as imposition will be in writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.

However, the City Engineer, Street Superintendent, Police Department or other designated official may not abate the violation without complying with the provisions consistent with Section F (2).
(3) Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements set forth in division (B) of this section will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary enforcement, the officer charged with enforcement shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare. The enforcement officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or welfare will be

unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated.

(4) Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
(G) Recovery of cost.
(1) Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator or other official designated by the City Council shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Administrator.
(2) Assessment.

However the owner must respond to the notice within 14 days of receipt of said notice to what will be the disposition of the nuisance. If within the 60-day period the property owner has not abated the nuisance, the designated officer shall take action to remove and dispose of the nuisance at the owners expense. (see 3 below)
(2) Record.

The planned unit development projects shall be developed in accordance with an overall design and an integrated general development plan, be consistent with the intent and purposes of this section, and not adversely affect the property adjacent to the land included in the project.
(2) Regulations.
(a) A planned unit project development shall consist of a harmonious selection of uses and grouping of buildings, services and parking areas, circulation and open spaces, and shall be planned and designed as an integrated unit, in a manner as to constitute a safe, efficient and convenient living area. This project shall be consistent with the comprehensive land use plan for the city.
(b) The project may provide for a commercial land use, as the same is defined in this chapter, provided, the commercial land use occupy not more than 15% of the land in the planned unit development not occupied by streets and alleys. All commercial land uses must be related to and be compatible with residential land uses in the planned unit development.
(c) The project shall conform to all of the following requirements:
1. Listed in Appendix A;
2. Application of standard ratios:
a. Gross land area x maximum residential floor area ratio = maximum floor area permitted;
b. Actual floor area x minimum open space ratio minimum required open space;
c. Actual floor area x minimum livability space ratio = minimum required livability space; (open space minus parking, streets, drives, delivery areas and driveways);
d. Actual floor area x recreation space ratio minimum required recreation space; (space devoted entirely to recreational land use for the residents in the PUD);
e. Actual number of dwelling units x minimum off-street parking ratio =
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING

number of off-street parking spaces required;
f. PUD area - streets and alleys x maximum commercial area ratio = maximum gross commercial land area;
g. Actual commercial land area x maximum commercial lot coverage ratio = maximum commercial lot average;
h. Actual commercial floor area x minimum off-street parking ratio = minimum off-street parking area; and
i. Actual commercial land area x minimum green space ratio = minimum green space area.
(d) The minimum area of land to be included in a planned development shall at least be two acres.
(e) The planned unit development project shall be served by sewer and water systems.
(f) Private roadways within the project shall be installed to city’s specifications for public roadways.
(g) In order that the purposes of the planned unit development project may be achieved, the land and buildings and appurtenant facilities shall be in single ownership or under the management and supervision of a central authority, or otherwise subject to supervisory lease or ownership control as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. This requirement shall be binding upon the heirs and assigns, if the project be under single ownership, or the successors and assigns if the project be under the management and supervision of a central authority, and any heirs or assigns or successors and assigns who may take over the completion of the project must comply with the original general development plan.

Low or swamp land may be a part of open space when the Planning Commission finds that lands are needed for drainage purposes, or suitable for park development, and conform to the comprehensive plan and will enhance the neighborhood through the preservation of natural areas. The low or swamp lands, shall be considered, no more than 25% of the total area in computing overall density. The open spaces shall be permanent and may not be replatted in the future. The Planning Commission may in the case of the plats showing land, to be used for park, recreation, school, open space or other space, or other municipal use, set forth conditions of the ownership, maintenance, and use of the
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
32
lands as it deems necessary to assure preservation of the lands for their intended purpose. Park recreation, school, or open space lands at the option of the city may be deeded to the public, retained by the developer or deeded to an association of home owners.

(‘92 Code, § 7.35) (Ord. 42, Fourth Series, eff. 5-31-92; Ord. 7, Seventh Series, 6-14-14)
§ 7.36 TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES REGULATIONS.
A. Purpose and Findings.
1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish predictable and balanced regulations for telecommunication facilities and systems in order to accommodate such within the city, while protecting the community against any adverse impacts to the public welfare or aesthetic resources.
2. Findings. The City of Fergus Falls finds the following:
1. Wireless telecommunication systems provide a valuable service to the public. However, telecommunications facilities and systems are not a public utility nor part of the public infrastructure system.
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
91
2. To promote and preserve the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the community, the location, design, construction, and modification of telecommunication facilities and systems must be regulated.
3. To minimize the visual impact of telecommunication facilities:
a. installation of facilities on existing support structures is favored over installation of new, freestanding telecommunication towers;
b. new telecommunication towers must be designed to accommodate more than one telecommunication provider and must incorporate stealth design techniques; and
4. To minimize safety hazards and visual impacts, and to ensure continued and adequate space for public utilities, public right-of-way should be minimally used for telecommunication facilities.
3. Severability. Every section, subdivision, clause or phrase of this is declared separable from every other section, subdivision, clause or phrase. If any such part is held to be invalid by competent authority, no other part shall be invalidated by such action or decision.
B. Definitions. The following definitions apply in this chapter of this code, unless the
context clearly indicates a different meaning. References hereafter to “sections” are, unless otherwise specified, references to sections in this chapter. Defined terms remain defined terms, whether or not capitalized.
Accessory Equipment. Wires, cables, generators, or other equipment or apparatus associated with an antenna and necessary for telecommunication transmission.
Antenna. Any device used for the transmission or reception of wireless radio television, or electromagnetic waves for cellular, internet service, personal communication service, enhanced specialized mobilized radio service, or television purposes.
Engineer. An engineer licensed by the state of Minnesota, or an engineer acceptable to the city if licensing is not available.
Small Wireless Facility. A wireless facility that meets both of the following qualifications:
1) Each antenna is located inside an enclosure of no more than six cubic feet in volume or could fit within such an enclosure; and

a. Facilities are subject to the requirements of Section 5.04 of this Code, Right-of-Way Management. To the extent that the provisions of Section 5.04 of this Code are more restrictive than this chapter, the provisions of Section 5.04 govern.
b. Facilities may not impact the public health, safety, or welfare, interfere with safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or otherwise negatively impact the right-of-way or its users. In determining compliance with this standard, the city many consider one or more of the following factors:
(1) The extent to which right-of-way space is available for the proposed facility, including accessory equipment.
(2) The potential demand for the particular space in the right-of-way.
(3) The availability of other locations in the right-of-way that would have less public impact.
(4) The extent to which the facility placement minimizes impacts on adjacent property.

(5) The applicability of ordinances or other regulations that may affect the location of the facility or accessory equipment.
c. Facilities must be removed when required by the road authority.
2. Facilities located outside of public right-of-way. In addition to the regulations outlined in the previous section, all telecommunication facilities located outside the public right-of-way are subject to the following specific regulations:
a. Location. Telecommunication facilities may be located within any zoning district. However, on properties zoned R-1 or R-2 residential, facilities may only be located on public or institutional property.
b. Height. Maximum tower height, excluding lightning rods, is restricted based on the land use designation of property on which the tower is located:
Land Use Designation
Single-User Tower
Multiple-User Tower
R-A, R-1 and R-2
60 feet
90 feet
R-3, R-4 and R-5

The city council may increase height if the applicant can demonstrate that the increase would not have a significant impact on surrounding properties because of things like proximity, topography, or screening by trees or buildings. The council may likewise waive height restrictions for towers wholly or partially for essential public services, such as public safety.
c. Setbacks. Towers located adjacent to low or medium-density residential properties must meet the minimum setback requirements established for principal structures within the associated residential zoning district, but only from the property line abutting the residential district. The city council may waive the setback requirement if necessary to implement stealth design techniques. Accessory equipment must meet minimum setback requirements established for accessory structures within the zoning district.
d. Horizontal Projection. Antennas may not project out from an antenna support structure or tower, unless it is physically impossible to locate the antenna with the structure or tower, in which case they may not project out more than three feet.

97
e. Vertical Projection. Antennas mounted on an antenna support structure may not extend more than 15 feet above the structure to which they are attached. Wall or façade-mounted antennas may not extend above the cornice line and must be constructed of a material or color that matches the exterior of the building.
f. Accessory Equipment. Accessory equipment or buildings must be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding natural or built environment or must be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of non-vegetative screening better reflects and complements the character of the surrounding neighborhood. No more than one accessory building is permitted for each tower.
g. Color. Antennas and towers must be painted a non-contrasting color consistent with the surrounding area such as: blue, gray, brown, or silver, or have a galvanized finish to reduce visual impact. Metal towers must be constructed of, or treated with, corrosion-resistant material.
h. Lighting. Telecommunications facilities may not be artificially illuminated unless required by law or by a governmental agency to protect the public's health and safety or unless necessary to facilitate service to ground-mounted equipment.
3. Facilities located within public right-of-way. In addition to the regulations outlined in the previous section, all telecommunication facilities located within the public right-of-way are subject to the following specific regulations:
a. Location.
(1) Within residential zoning districts, facilities are only permitted within the rights-of-way of collector or arterial streets as designated by the City Engineer.
(2) Facilities are not permitted adjacent to residentially zoned property unless an applicant demonstrates, by providing a study prepared by a radio or electrical engineer, that the proposed location is necessary to reasonably meet the coverage and capacity needs of its system and no other location is feasible in a non-residential area.
b. Height. Maximum height, including attachments other than lightning rods, is restricted based on the land use designation of property adjacent to the proposed facility:
Adjacent Land Use Designation
Maximum Height
All Residential including R-A
60 feet
Office, Commercial, Business

e. Vertical Projection. Antennas mounted on an antenna support structure may not extend more than 10 feet above the structure to which they are attached.
f. Facility Separation. Telecommunication facilities must be separated by at least 330 feet.
g. Ground-mounted accessory equipment.
(1) Equipment will be allowed only if it will not adversely impact public health, safety, or welfare of the community. In determining compliance with this standard, the city many consider whether the equipment will disrupt vehicle traffic or pedestrian circulation, and/or whether the equipment location and screening minimizes impact on adjacent properties.
(2) Equipment must not exceed the following size limits:
Adjacent Land Use Designation
Maximum Height
Maximum Volume
Residential and R-A
3 feet
28 cubic feet

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 7.51 BOARD OF ZONING ADJUSTMENT.
(A) Creation and membership. A Board of Zoning Adjustment is hereby established and vested with the administrative authority as is hereinafter provided.
(B) Powers. The Board of Zoning Adjustment, subject to the approval and confirmation of the Council in each case, as hereinafter provided, shall have power to grant adjustments in and exceptions to any of the provisions of this chapter to the extent of division (1) below and to the extent that the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall not have the authority to vary or modify a permitted use or conditional use in a manner other than that prescribed in this chapter.
(1) The Board of Zoning Adjustment may hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of this chapter in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the ordinance. “Undue hardship” as used in connection with the granting of a variance means the property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the official controls, the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner, and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship if reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of the ordinance. Undue hardship also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined in M.S. § 216C.06, Subd. 2, as it may be amended from time to time, when in harmony with the ordinance. The board of appeals and adjustments or the governing body as the case may be, may not permit as a variance any use that is not permitted under the ordinance for property in the zone where the affected person’s land is located. The Board of Zoning Adjustments may permit as a variance the temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-family dwelling. The Board of Zoning Adjustments may impose conditions in the granting of variances to insure compliance and to protect adjacent properties.
(2) The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall not recommend the granting of any application and the Council shall not grant any application unless they find the following facts. At the hearing, the applicant shall present a statement and evidence in the form as the Board of Zoning Adjustment may require to show these facts:
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
135
(a) The variance requested arises from the condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or applicant.
(b) The granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents.
(c) The strict application of divisions of this chapter which variance is requested will constitute unusual hardship, as stated in § 7.51(B)(1), upon the property owner represented in the application.
(d) The variance desired will not affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare.
(e) The granting of the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and content of the zoning chapter.
(C) Appeals. Any person objecting to the ruling of any official on the administering of the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
(D) Procedure.
(1) Application for any adjustment permissible under the provisions of this section shall be made to the Zoning Administrator, in the form of a written application or for a permit to use the property as premises as set forth in the application. An application for an adjustment shall be accompanied by payment of the required fee. Upon receipt of any application, the officer shall set a time and place for a public hearing before the Board of Zoning Adjustment on the application. At least ten days before the date of the hearing, a notice of the hearing shall be published once in the official newspaper, the cost of publication and the filing fee to be paid by the applicant. When shorelands will be affected by the application for adjustment, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will be notified ten days prior to the application hearing. A copy of any resolution granting a variance under the city shoreland provisions will be forwarded to the Commissioner within ten days of final action.
(2) The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall thereupon make its decision upon the application, and the action of the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be reported to the Council within 15 days of the public hearing. In recommending any adjustment or variance under the provisions of this section, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall designate the conditions in connection therewith as will, in its opinion, secure substantially the objectives of the regulation or provision to which the adjustment or variance is granted, as to light, air and the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
(3) No permit shall be issued under the provisions of this section unless and until a decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment, as aforesaid, approving the same, is approved and
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
136
confirmed by the Council. In reporting its decision to the Council, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall report its findings with respect thereto and all facts in connection therewith, and shall specifically and fully set forth any adjustment or variance granted and the conditions designated. Upon receipt of the report, the Council shall by resolution either approve and confirm the decision, with or without changes, whereupon the permit as applied for may be issued, or shall refuse to approve and confirm the decision. In all cases in which adjustments or variances are granted under the provisions of this section, the Board of Zoning Adjustment and the Council shall require evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary to insure compliance with the conditions designated in connection therewith.
(4) The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall either approve or deny an appeal or an application for a variance within 60 days after the completed appeal or application is filed, unless the Board determines within that 60-day period that an additional 60 days is necessary and informs the applicant of its decision to and the reasons for extending the first 60-day period by an additional 60 days. The failure of a vote to decide an appeal or approve an application shall not be deemed to be a denial of the application. A motion to deny the application must be adopted. The facts upon which the decision is based and the reasons for the decision shall be stated in writing at the time of the decision.

137
(1) Application for the issuance of a conditional use permit shall be made to the Planning Commission, except that any proceedings to classify certain uses as conforming uses, as provided in this section, may be initiated either by the application or by the Council or by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may hold hearings on the proposal to issue a conditional use permit as it may consider necessary, but at least one public hearing shall be held on any application for a conditional use permit for the establishment of any use listed in division (A)(5). Following the hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a report on the proposal to the Council and shall recommend to the Council whatever action it deems advisable; but the Planning Commission shall not recommend the granting of a permit unless it finds that the establishment, maintenance or conducting of the use for which a use permit is sought will not under the circumstances of the particular case be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience or welfare of the persons residing or working in the area adjacent to the use or to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the area adjacent to the use. The Planning Commission may designate conditions and require guarantees in the granting of use permits in the manner provided in § 7.51, Board of Zoning Adjustments, for the granting of adjustments. When shorelands will be affected by the application for conditional use, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will be notified at least ten days prior to the application hearing. A copy of any resolution granting a conditional use permit under the city shoreland provisions will be forwarded to the Commissioner within ten days of final action.
(2) To defray administrative costs of processing requests for conditional use permits, a permit fee shall be paid by the applicant. In the event additional costs are incurred, the applicant shall pay additional costs. Permit fees shall be adopted by resolution of the Council and may be amended from time to time in the same manner. Provided, however, that a schedule of fees, together with the effective date thereof, shall be kept on file in the office of the City Administrator and available for distribution upon request therefor. The fees shall be uniformly enforced upon the adoption or amendment.
(3) Upon receipt of the report of the Planning Commission, the Council shall hold whatever public hearings it deems advisable and shall make a decision upon the proposal to grant a conditional use permit.
(4) Any use permitted under the terms of any conditional use permit shall be established and conducted in conformity to the terms of a permit and any conditions designated in connection therewith.
(5) The City Council shall either approve or deny an application for a conditional use permit within 60 days after the completed application is filed, unless the Council determines within that 60-day period that an additional 60 days is necessary and informs the applicant of its decision to and the reasons for extending the first 60-day period by an additional 60 days. The failure of a vote to approve an application shall not be deemed to be a denial of the application. A motion to deny the application must be adopted.

Pending the issuance of a certificate, the Zoning Administrator may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a period of not exceeding six months during the completion of the erection or alteration of the building. The temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective rights, duties or obligations of the owners or of the city relating to the use or the occupancy of the premises or any other matter except under restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of the occupants.
(2) Every certificate of occupancy shall state that the building or proposed use of a building or land complies with all provisions of the law and of this chapter. A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator, and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land affected. No fee shall be charged for a certificate of occupancy.
(3) No building permit for the erection or alteration of a building shall be issued before application has been made for a certificate of occupancy.
(4) A certificate of occupancy shall be issued for all lawful nonconforming uses of land or buildings created by adoption of this chapter or in existence at the effective date of this chapter. Application for a certificate of occupancy for a nonconforming use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator by the owner or lessee of the building or land occupied by a nonconforming use within one year of the effective date of this chapter. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to issue a certificate of occupancy for a lawful nonconforming use. Failure to apply for a certificate of occupancy for a nonconforming use or refusal of the Zoning Administrator to issue a certificate of occupancy for a nonconforming use shall be prima facie evidence that the nonconforming use was either illegal or did not lawfully exist at the effective date of this chapter.

(2) A recommendation of the Planning Commission; or
(3) By action of the Council.
(B) To defray administrative costs of processing a request for an amendment to this chapter, a fee shall be paid by the petitioner. In the event additional costs are incurred, the applicant shall pay additional costs. Fees shall be adopted by resolution of the Council and may be amended from time to time in the same manner. Provided, however, that a schedule of fees, together with the effective date thereof, shall be kept on file in the office of the City Administrator and available for distribution upon request therefor. The fees shall be uniformly enforced upon the adoption or amendment.
(C) All applications for changes in the boundaries of any zoning district which are initiated by the petition of the owner or owners of property, the zoning of which is proposed to be changed, shall be accompanied by a map or plat showing the lands proposed to be changed and all lands within 350 feet of the boundaries of the property proposed to be rezoned, together with the names and addresses of the owners of the lands in the area.

SUBDIVIDING
§ 7.70 TITLE AND REFERENCE.
§7.70 through §7.82, inclusive, shall be known as the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Fergus Falls. References in those sections to this subchapter, unless the context clearly indicates contrary intent, shall be to the subject of subdividing.
(‘92 Code, § 7.70) (Ord. 117, Third Series, eff. 4-10-85)
§ 7.71 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(A) Purpose.
(1) In order to safeguard the best interests of the city and to assist the subdivider in harmonizing his or her interests with those of the city at large, this chapter is adopted. Because each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic structure of the expanding community, and to which the community will be forced to adhere, and because piecemeal planning of subdivisions will bring on undesirable disconnected patchwork of pattern and poor circulation of traffic unless its design and arrangement is correlated to a comprehensive plan of the city aiming at a unified scheme of community interests, all subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval to the Planning Commission shall, in all respects, fully comply with the regulations hereinafter set forth in this subchapter.
(2) It is the purpose of this subchapter to make certain regulations and requirements for the platting of land within the city pursuant to the authority contained in M.S. Chs. 429, 471 and 505, and M.S. § 462.358, as they may be amended from time to time, which regulations the
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
141
Council deems necessary for health, safety and the general welfare.
(B) Jurisdiction. No conveyance of land described by metes and bounds or by reference to an unapproved registered land survey made after April 21, 1961, or to an unapproved plat made after December 11, 1965 shall be filed or recorded unless the land:
(1) Was a separate parcel of record on December 11, 1965;
(2) Was the subject of a written agreement to convey entered into prior to December 11, 1965;
(3) Was a separate parcel of not less than two and one-half acres in area and 150 feet in width on January 1, 1966; or
(4) If a single parcel of land of not less than 50 acres and having a width of not less than 300 feet, and its conveyance does not result in the division of land into two or more lots or parcels, any one of which is less than five acres in area or 300 feet in width. Building permits shall not be issued for buildings on tracts which have been subdivided and conveyed in violation of this division, and the city may refuse to take over or improve tracts as streets or roads therein, or refuse to repair or maintain the tracts. The owner or agent of the owner of land who conveys a lot or parcel in violation of this division shall pay to the city a penalty of not less than $100 for each lot or parcel so conveyed, and the city may enjoin the conveyance or may recover the penalty by a civil action.
(C) Application of chapter. Any plat, hereafter made, for each subdivision or each part thereof lying within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be prepared, presented for approval, and recorded as herein prescribed. The regulations contained herein shall apply to the subdivision of a previously unplatted lot, tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, tracts or other division of land for the purpose of sale or building development, whether immediate or future. The resubdivision or replatting of land or lots for the purpose of changing previously established lot lines is required if the proposed changes either affect the boundaries of more than six lots, affect any public right of way, or is recommended by the City Engineer in conjunction with the Planning Commission. Division of tracts larger than 2.5 acres in area and 150 feet in width shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter where no new street is involved.
(D) Approvals necessary for acceptance of subdivision plats. Before any plat be recorded or be of any validity, it shall have been approved by the Planning Commission and by the Council, as having fulfilled the requirements of this chapter.
(E) Land suitability. No land shall be subdivided which is held unsuitable by the Council for the proposed use because of flooding, inadequate drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal capabilities or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.

(F) Holding and drainage ways. Where it is deemed necessary or desirable, and upon recommendation of the City Engineer and Planning Commission, the Council may require the subdivider to dedicate to the public portions of land proposed to be subdivided for the purpose of storm water holding areas, ponds and drainage ways.

Prior to final consideration of the preliminary plat, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing thereon. Where applications for both a preliminary plat approval and a zoning district change, involving the same land, are pending at the same time, the issues may, at the option of the Planning Commission, be combined and heard at the same time.
(c) The Planning Commission shall have the authority to recommend approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat, to approve it with conditions attached, and to disapprove it until and unless certain conditions are first complied with.
(d) Upon the making of its determination, the Planning Commission shall embrace the same within a motion, which shall include all conditions it requires for approval, or conditions upon which approval will be granted, and shall set forth the reasons for the approval given. A copy of the motion shall be sent forthwith to the subdivider and a copy thereof to the Council, together with the plat if it is approved, conditionally or otherwise.
(2) Submittal to the Council. The City Council shall either approve or deny an application for a preliminary plat within 120 days after the completed application is filed, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of this time. The failure of a vote to decide an appeal or approve an application shall not be deemed to be a denial of the application. A motion to deny the application must be adopted. The facts upon which the decision is based and the reasons for the decision shall be stated in writing at the time of the decision.
(a) Upon the adoption of the motion hereinabove provided by the Planning Commission, the plat shall come before the Council for review. Within ten days from approval of the preliminary plat by the Council, a copy of the preliminary plat will be forwarded to the Commissioner of Natural Resources.
(b) The Council may hold public hearings on the plat as it shall in its discretion determine, and upon the notice as it shall provide, as provided by M.S. § 462.358, Subd. 3b, as it may be amended from time to time.

(g) The approval of the preliminary plat by the Council shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of approval by the Council.
(h) The subdivider may file a final plat limited to the portion of the preliminary plat which he or she proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that the portion must conform to all requirements of this chapter. If some portion, or all, of the final plat has not been submitted to the Planning Commission for approval within the time hereinabove provided, a preliminary plat must again be submitted to the Planning Commission and the Council for approval, unless the Commission and the Council shall waive this requirement.
(B) Approval of preliminary and final plat simultaneously. Where the developer has submitted all data required for both the preliminary and final plat, the Planning Commission, following a public hearing on the plat, may recommend to the Council approval of both the preliminary and final plat simultaneously.

(1) Block length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be provided at intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivisions shall normally not exceed 1,000 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required. The width and location of pedestrian ways shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and the Planning Commission. Blocks for business or industrial use should normally not exceed 600 feet in length.
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
153
(2) Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of a width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries.
(B) Streets and alleys.
(1) The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall conform as nearly as possible to the Comprehensive Plan. Except for culs-de-sac, streets normally shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic to topographic conditions, to run-off storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the area to be served.
(2) Minor streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by non-local traffic. Dead-end streets are prohibited, but culs-de-sac will be permitted whereby topography or other conditions justify their use. Culs-de-sac shall normally not be longer than 500 feet, including a terminal turn-around which shall be provided at the closed end, with a right of way radius of not less than 50 feet.
(3) Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tracts owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
(4) When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels the lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility connections for the resubdivision.
(5) Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify variations. The minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be 80 degrees. Street intersection jogs with an offset of less than 125 feet shall be avoided.
(6) Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right of way of a limited access U.S. or state highway or thoroughfare, provision may be made for a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of the right of way, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between streets and right of way. The distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separations, grade crossings or for lot depths.
(7) Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that this
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
154
requirement may be waived where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Except where justified by special conditions such as the continuation of an existing alley in the same block, alleys will not be approved in residential districts. Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than 16 feet wide for residential alleys and not less than 25 feet for commercial and industrial alleys. Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
(8) Dedication of half streets will not be approved, except where it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations where it is found that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to acquire the remaining half by condemnation so it may be improved in the public interest.
(a) For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the minimum right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be as shown in the comprehensive plan and where not shown therein, the minimum right of way width for streets, thoroughfares, alleys or pedestrian ways included in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as follows:
Rights-of-Way Minimum Width
Primary thoroughfare
100 feet
Secondary thoroughfare
80 feet
Collector street
75 feet
Minor street
75 feet
Marginal access street
50 feet
Residential alley
16 feet
Industrial commercial alley
25 feet
Pedestrian way
10 feet
(b) Where existing or anticipated traffic on primary and secondary thoroughfares warrants greater widths of rights of way, these shall be required.
(9) Street grades.
(a) The grades in all streets, thoroughfares, collector streets, minor streets, and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than the maximum grades for each classification as
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
155
follows: Rights-of-Way Maximum Grades
Primary thoroughfare
4%
Secondary thoroughfare
4%
Collector street
5%
Minor street
8%
Alley
8%
(b) In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and thoroughfares of not less than four-tenths of 1%.
(10) Street alignment. The horizontal and vertical alignment standards on all streets shall be as follows:
(a) Horizontal; radii of center line.
1. Major thoroughfare, 500 feet minimum; secondary thoroughfare, 500 feet minimum; collector street, 400 feet minimum; minor street, 150 feet minimum.
2. There shall be a tangent between all reversed curves of a length in relation to the radii of the curves so as to provide for a smooth flow of traffic.
(b) Vertical; all changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical parabolic curves of the length as follows:
1. Primary thoroughfare or secondary thoroughfare, 30 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes.
2. Collector street or minor street, 20 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes.
(11) Dedications. All proposed streets shall be offered for dedication as public streets. No private streets shall be permitted, except as set forth in other ordinances.
(C) Lots.
(1) For lots intended for building sites, the minimum lot area, width and depth shall not be less than that established by the zoning regulations.
(2) Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit appropriate
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
156
building setback from both streets as defined in the zoning regulations.
(3) Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines.
(4) Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where lots back on a thoroughfare or other arterial street, or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Double frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least 20 feet in order to allow space for screen planting along the back lot line.
(5) Every lot must have at least the minimum required frontage on a public dedicated street other than an alley.
(D) Basements.
(1) An easement for utilities, at least five feet wide, shall be provided along each side of a side line of lots and along any other lot line as may be deemed necessary to form a continuous right of way, at least ten feet in width. If necessary for the extension of main water or sewer line or similar utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots.
(2) Utility easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval of the Council, by ordinance upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
(3) Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.
(4) Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park dedication, whichever the Planning Commission may deem the most adequate, conforming substantially with the lines of the water courses shall be provided, together with further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the storm water drainage of the area. The width of the easements shall be determined by the City Engineer.
(E) Public sites and open spaces. In subdividing land or resubdividing an existing plat, due consideration shall be given by the subdivider to the dedication or reservation of suitable sites, for schools, parks, playgrounds, conservation areas or other public or semi-public recreational areas or open spaces. Areas so dedicated or reserved shall conform as nearly as possible to the comprehensive plan. All areas to be reserved for or dedicated to public use shall be indicated on the preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner the areas will be dedicated to or acquired by the appropriate agency.

§ 7.78 BASIC IMPROVEMENTS.
(A) General.
(1) Approval.
(a) Before a final plat may be approved by the Council, the owner shall execute and submit to the Council an agreement, which shall be binding on his or her (or their) heirs, personal representatives and assigns, that he or she shall cause no private construction on the land, except with approval of the City Engineer, until all improvements required under this chapter have been petitioned for, arranged for, or have been constructed.
(b) No final plat shall be approved by the Council without first receiving a report from the City Engineer certifying that the improvements described herein, together with the agreements and documents required herein will meet the minimum requirements of all applicable ordinances.
(c) A certified copy of the plat restrictions shall be filed with the City Administrator and Register of Deeds which shall include a provision that, in all instruments of sale or conveyance given before all street improvements have been made, the consignee shall agree to and approve the improvements and the assessments of their cost.
(2) City financing. Upon recommendation of the Engineer and with the approval of the Council, any or all of the required improvements may be financed and assessed by the city pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time. Length of assessment period and rate of interest shall be as determined by the Council.
(3) Financing by developer. If deemed advisable and to be in the best interests of the city, the Council may require the developer to finance and pay for any or all improvements. Prior to the making of the required improvements, the owner or subdivider shall deposit with the City Administrator an amount equal to the City Engineer’s estimated cost of any or all of improvements which are to be financed by the developer, either in cash or an indemnity bond, with sureties to the satisfaction of the Council, conditioned upon the payment of all construction costs incurred by the city in making of the improvements and all expense incurred by the city for engineering and legal fees and other expense in connection with the making of the improvements as required by ordinance. All improvements shall be contracted through the city.
(B) Improvements. The following improvements shall be constructed as provided for in this section. Programming of improvements shall be approved by the City Engineer.
(1) City obligation. The city will construct, furnish and install at city expense, the following improvements according to city specifications. Furnishing of these improvements shall
ZONING AND SUBDIVIDING
158
be commensurate with available city funds for the work and according to programs and priorities as established by the Council. If the developer would desire any of these improvements sooner than the city would be able to furnish them, then the costs of the following improvements shall be paid for by the developer.
(a) Street lighting. Street lighting shall be constructed by the city, preferably after curb and gutter have been installed. If additional or other type of lighting is desired by the developer, he or she shall pay the increased cost thereof.
(b) Signs. Street name signs and traffic-control signs shall be installed by the city.
(2) Obligation of developer. The developer shall pay the proportionate amount of the following improvements on or for his or her subdivision or development. Financing shall be according to division (A) of this section.
(a) Site grading. Necessary site grading shall be accomplished by the subdivider.
(b) Street grading. Street grading for the full width of right of way shall be accomplished by the subdivider. If no site grading is to be accomplished, the street grading will be included with subsequent street improvements. Street grading shall precede any underground work. Where street grading is not to be immediately followed by street paving, the developer may be required to provide permanent grade markers at the right of way line of all streets of a standard approved by the City Engineer.
(c) Street improvements. Street improvements including base, curb and gutter, boulevard sodding, inlets and leads, and paving, according to standard city specifications or as approved by the City Engineer, shall be constructed. All required underground work shall have preceded any permanent street improvements. Any improvements on a county road shall be approved by the County Engineer. Temporary construction may, at the discretion of the City Engineer, be required, for just cause, or any street, streets or portion thereof. Reconstruction or alteration in any way of existing streets affected by the plat or improvements thereon, shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer. All costs therein incurred, for either temporary access or reconstruction, shall be borne by the owner or subdivider. Half streets, if accepted, shall be improved as directed by the City Engineer.

§ 7.79 REGISTERED LAND SURVEYS; CONVEYANCES BY METES AND BOUNDS.
(A) Registered land surveys. It is the intention of this chapter that all registered land surveys under the jurisdiction of this chapter should be presented to the Planning Commission in the form of a preliminary plat in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter for preliminary plats and that the Planning Commission shall first approve the arrangement, sizes and relationship of proposed tracts in the registered land surveys, and that tracts to be used as easements or roads should be so dedicated. Unless the approvals have been obtained from the Planning Commission and Council in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter, building permits will be withheld for buildings on tracts which have been so subdivided by registered land surveys, and the city may refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or to improve, repair or maintain any tracts unless so approved.
(B) Conveyance by metes and bounds. No conveyance of one or more parcels in which the land conveyed is described by metes and bounds shall be made or recorded if the parcels described in the conveyance are less than 2½ acres in area and 150 feet in width unless the parcel was a separate parcel of record at the effective date of this chapter. Building permits will be withheld for buildings on tracts which have been subdivided and conveyed by this method, and the city may refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or to improve, repair or maintain any tracts.

(A) General conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend a variance from the provisions of this chapter when, in its opinion, undue hardship on the land may result from strict compliance. In granting any variance, the Planning Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, the Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the Commission finds:
(1) There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property so that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land.
(2) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the petitioner.
(3) The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the property is situated.
(B) Applications required. Applications for any the variance shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for consideration by the Commission, stating fully and clearly all facts relied upon by the petitioner and shall be supplemented with maps, plans or other additional data which may aid the Commission in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans for the development shall include the covenants, restrictions, or other legal provisions necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan.

Rules Ch. 4410, as it may be amended from time to time, one copy of which is on file in the office of the City Administrator, are hereby adopted, together with the other provisions of this chapter, as the environmental review operating procedures this city will follow in implementing the provisions of M.S. Ch. 116D, as it may be amended from time to time, relating to the environmental review program and any rules adopted hereunder by the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board. All terms used in this chapter shall have the same meaning as the terms used in Ch. 116D and the rules adopted thereunder.
(B) Cost of preparation and review.
(1) Information to be provided. The applicant for a permit for any action for which environmental documents are required either by state law or rules or by the Council shall supply in the manner prescribed by the City Engineer all non-privileged data or information reasonably requested by the city that the applicant has in his or her possession or to which he or she has reasonable access.
(2) Environmental assessment work sheets. The applicant for a permit for any action for which an environmental assessment work sheet (EAW) is required either by state law or rules or by the Council, shall pay all cost of preparation and review of the EAW, and, upon the request of and in the manner prescribed by the City Engineer shall prepare a draft EAW and supply all information necessary to complete that document.
(3) Environmental impact statement. The city and the applicant for a permit for any action for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required shall comply with the provisions of the rules governing assessment of costs for environmental impact statements, one copy of which is on file in the office of the City Administrator, unless the applicant and the Council provide otherwise by a written agreement.
(4) Payment of costs. No permit for an action for which an EAW or an EIS is required shall be issued until all costs of preparation and review which are to be paid by the applicant are paid, and all information required is supplied, and until the environmental review proceeds have been completed as provided in this chapter and the rules adopted by reference by this chapter, and pursuant to any written agreement entered into by the applicant for the permit or permits and the Council under the provisions of division (E).

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
(C) Administration.
(1) The City Engineer shall be the person responsible for the administration of the environmental review program, this chapter and the rules adopted by reference by this chapter.
(2) The City Engineer shall be responsible for determining whether an action for which a permit is required is an action for which an EAW is mandatory under Minn. Rules 4410.1000, as it may be amended from time to time. The City Engineer shall also determine those proposed actions for which an optional EAW may be required under the provisions of this chapter and shall notify the Planning Commission and the Council of these proposed actions.
(3) All EAWs and EISs shall be prepared under the supervision of the City Engineer, reviewed by the Planning Commission and reviewed and approved by the Council.
(4) When reviewing an EAW or EIS, the City Engineer and the Planning Commission may suggest design alterations which would lessen the environmental impact of the action. The Council may require these design alterations to be made as a condition for issuing the permit when it finds that the design alterations are necessary to lessen the environmental impact of the action.
(5) After an EAW is prepared, the Planning Commission shall review the EAW and recommend to the Council whether or not it should require the preparation of an EIS. The Council shall require an EIS when it finds under Minn. Rules 4410.1700, as it may be amended from time to time, that an action is major and has potential for significant environmental effects.
(D) Optional EAW. The Council may, upon recommendation by the City Engineer require that an optional EAW be prepared on any proposed action if the action may be a major action and appears to have the potential for significant environmental effects. The following guidelines shall also be considered in determining whether an optional EAW shall be required:
(1) Is the action to be in or near an area that is considered to be environmentally sensitive or aesthetically pleasing?
(2) Is the action likely to have disruptive effects such as generating traffic and noise?
(3) Are there public questions or controversy concerning the environmental effects of the proposed actions?
(E) Enforcement.
(1) No permit shall be issued for a project for which environmental documents are required until the entire environmental review procedures established by this chapter are completed.
(2) No work shall commence and any work in progress on any project for which

§ 11.71 SOCIAL HOST.
(A) Purpose and Findings. The Fergus Falls City Council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Fergus Falls City Council finds that:
(1) Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement.
(2) Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions.
(3) Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
(4) Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES

(5) Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption.

Section 3. City Code Section 4.35 is hereby amended in its entirety so as to read as follows:
4.35.1 RENTAL DWELLING REGISTRATION; PURPOSE
The City Council concludes the regulation of rental practices of single-family and multiple-tenant residential dwelling units through registration will promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City, particularly those residents who live in rental properties and neighborhoods surrounding them. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and welfare of citizens of the City by adopting a rental dwelling registration, inspection and maintenance program that corrects substandard conditions, maintains a standard for existing, newly constructed and/or converted rental dwellings, and ensures neighborhood stability in the City. The operation of rental properties is a business enterprise that includes certain responsibilities. Rental dwelling owners and managers are responsible to take necessary reasonable actions to ensure that the citizens who occupy such rental dwelling units, as well as neighboring properties, may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of life in surroundings that are safe, secure, and sanitary, free from noise, nuisances and annoyances, and free from unreasonable fears about safety of persons and property.
4.35.2 INTERPRETATION:
This chapter is to be construed liberally in conjunction with the provisions of this Code to give effect to the policy, purpose, and objectives of this chapter, but is not to be construed to modify, amend or otherwise alter the provisions of this Code relating to health, safety, building or land use regulation. It is not the intention of the City to intrude upon the fair accepted contractual
relationship between tenant and landlord. The City does not intend to intervene as an advocate of either party, or to act as an arbiter. It is determined that certain conditions within existing buildings, lawful at the time of construction of the building, and not creating a hazardous condition, may not comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter. Such conditions are referred to as "built in deficiencies", and the Code official, in administering this chapter, may consider built in deficiencies as being beyond reasonable correction and accept them as an alternate method of meeting the intent of this chapter.
4.35.3 DEFINITIONS:
The following words and terms when used in this chapter shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: ADULT: A person eighteen (18) years of age or older.

In a manufactured home park, individual manufactured homes that are rented and not owner occupied shall require a rental registration.

Each rental dwelling unit must have an owner, or local property manager designated by the owner, who resides within 30 miles of the City of Fergus Falls, MN.

Failure to do so may be considered a registration violation.
(C) Action: The city administrator or its designee may either approve or deny the registration or may delay action for up to sixty (60) days to permit the City to complete any investigation of the application or the applicant as deemed necessary. If the city administrator approves the registration, a registration shall be issued to the applicant. If the city administrator denies the application, a notice of denial shall be sent to the applicant at the business address provided on the application along with the reasons for the denial.

If a registration is mistakenly issued or renewed to an applicant or registration holder, it shall be revoked by the city administrator or designee upon the discovery that the person, applicant or registration holder was ineligible for the registration under this chapter.
(D) Term: All registrations are issued for a period of one (1) year. The registration period shall be as determined by the city administrator. Refunds of registration fees will not be given.

4.35.6 INSPECTIONS:
(A) Rental residential buildings, properties, and rental units shall be inspected in their entirety every three (3) years prior to issuing or renewing an annual rental registration.

Buildings, units, and properties shall also be inspected following any violation of this chapter, this Code, Building Code or the Fire Code and thereafter at the property owner's expense.
(B) Such inspections shall confirm compliance with Building, Fire, Property Maintenance Codes as well as section 4.35.9 of this chapter. Buildings, units, and properties not in compliance will not be granted a registration. Rental units that meet this inspection standard with no deficiencies or repairs noted and have received the highest inspection rating as determined by the city administrator, will be eligible for self-inspection during the next inspection cycle provided the applicant certifies they inspected the rental unit and it meets all of the compliance requirements as established by the city administrator. A self-inspection is only valid for a period of three (3) years and at no time will a rental unit be allowed to be registered for a period of more than six (6) years without an inspection conducted by the city administrator.
(C) Any deficiencies or repairs noted in the inspection must be remedied in a timely fashion by the property owner and re-inspected for compliance by the City. The applicant is responsible for reinspection costs as noted in section 4.35.8 of this chapter.
(D) The city administrator or designee is authorized to make inspections reasonably necessary to enforce this chapter. All authorized inspectors have the authority to enter any rental dwelling or unrented and unoccupied rental dwelling unit at all reasonable times. The City will notify the registration holder to schedule the inspection; however, it is the responsibility of the registration holder to work with the City to ensure the inspection is scheduled and satisfactorily completed. The registration holder is responsible for notifying any existing tenant of the inspection at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance. The City will make reasonable efforts to notify the registration holder. The registration holder must provide access to the property to the requesting City official at the date and time of the scheduled inspection. Failure to provide access for any reason may result in a reinspection fee, in addition to any other sanctions imposed for
noncompliance. The City will not charge a reinspection fee if the owner/manager cooperates with gaining access to occupied units if refused by the tenant. If any owner, owner’s agent, registration holder, property manager or tenant fails or refuses to permit entry to a rental dwelling under its control for an inspection pursuant to this section, the city administrator or designee may pursue any remedy at law or under the City Code, including, but not limited to, securing an administrative search warrant for the rental dwelling, issuing an administrative citation, denying a rental registration application, revoking or suspending a rental registration, or denying a renewal registration. The City will use its best efforts to coordinate inspections with other governmental agencies when appropriate.
(E) Rental Units registered as a standard rental unit prior to November 15, 2018, are exempt from mandatory inspections as required in this section until the first of the following occurs:
(1) A call to service to the unit regarding a health or safety issue and the unit fails an inspection;
(2) The unit fails an inspection based on a complaint generated inspection for code violations;
(3) The unit fails an inspection based on a complaint generated from a tenant or neighbor; or
(4) The unit is visibly in need of substantial repair based upon a complaint or observation.
If any of these conditions occur, the unit will no longer be exempt from mandatory inspections and the city administrator may require an immediate inspection of the rental unit, issue compliance orders, and/or suspend or revoke the rental registration as provided in this chapter. This exemption from mandatory inspections of this paragraph (E) does not apply to any rental units or real property that: (i) receives tax abatement, tax increment financing, public assistance, or any other form of public subsidy; or, (ii) is sold, transferred or conveyed. All rental units that are exempt from mandatory inspections shall pay a standard registration fee as set by the City Council. Rental Units that are exempt from inspections must comply with all other provision of this Chapter.
4.35.7 ISSUANCE OF REGISTRATION:
(A) The application will be reviewed and the property will be inspected pursuant to section 4.35.6 of this chapter. If the property meets applicable codes, laws and ordinances, and fees have been paid, the Code official shall recommend issuance of the registration. If the property does not meet applicable codes, laws and ordinances, the Code official will advise the applicant of the deficiencies. The applicant shall address the deficiencies and thereafter request a reinspection of the property. All fees including reinspection fees must be paid prior to issuance of the registration. (B) The city administrator or designee may issue a provisional rental registration when
corrections required following inspection do not constitute a fire, safety or health hazard to the occupants or the general public, and the repairs are not practically feasible as a result of factors beyond the rental property owner's control. Such factors may include climatic conditions, or the unavailability of contractors, supplies or materials needed to make the corrections. A provisional rental registration shall be conditioned upon the rental property owner's making the needed corrections with timelines determined by the city administrator or designee. The provisional rental registration shall expire if the work is not completed, inspected and approved by the date listed thereon.
4.35.8 REGISTRATION FEES AND CHARGES:
(A) The application fee shall be determined by the City Council from time to time by resolution and shall be paid at the time of application. In the case of licensing periods of less than one (1) year, registration fees may be prorated quarterly.
(B) Conversion Fee: An owner-occupied unit that has not previously been a registered rental property and is converted to a rental property shall pay a conversion fee as adopted in the City fee schedule. The onetime conversion fee includes the rental registration application and inspection fees for the first year. A rental property with a registration that has been expired for greater than one (1) year will be subject to the full conversion fee and licensing inspection upon application for a rental registration.
(C) Annual Fire Inspection Fee: Multi-family rental residential buildings with shared common areas subject to an annual Fire Code inspection are required to pay the cost of the inspection as determined by the City Council by resolution and shall be paid prior to issuance of the registration.
(D) Reinspection Fees: The costs of any re-inspections shall be at the applicant's/owner's expense and shall be paid prior to issuing the registration for that property.

(A) Registration Holders Obligations and Codes Adopted: It is the responsibility of the registration holder to ensure that every rental residential building and rental dwelling unit is maintained in compliance with all City ordinances and State and Federal laws. The City's Property Maintenance Code, Building Code, and Fire Code are, in their entirety, except as modified or amended in this Code, adopted by reference and are made a part of this chapter as if fully set out at length.

building or rental dwelling unit. If the registration is revoked or suspended the registration holder may not let, rent or allow to be occupied any vacant dwelling units, or dwelling units that become vacant during the revocation or suspension period.
(B) Unfit for Human Habitation:
1. Any building, premises, dwelling unit, or portion thereof that is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the property is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating facilities, or other essential utilities services and equipment required by this Code, or because the location of a structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the property or to the public may be declared unfit for human habitation. Whenever any building, premises, or dwelling unit has been declared unfit for human habitation, the city administrator or designee shall order same vacated within a reasonable time and shall post a placard on same indicating that it is unfit for human habitation, and any operating registration previously issued for such building, premises, or dwelling unit shall be suspended or revoked.
2. It shall be unlawful for such building or portion thereof to be used for human habitation until the defective conditions have been corrected and written approval has been issued by the city administrator or designee. It shall be unlawful for any person to deface or remove the declaration placard from any such building.
(C) Hazardous Building Declaration: If a building has been declared unfit for human habitation and the owner has not remedied the defects within a prescribed reasonable time, the building may be declared a hazardous building and treated consistent with the provisions of Minnesota Statutes. The city administrator or designee will post the date the rental residential building or rental dwelling unit shall be vacated, and no person shall reside in, occupy or cause to be occupied that rental residential building or rental dwelling unit until the city administrator or City Council permits it.
(D) Compliance Order: Whenever the city administrator or designee determines that any building or portion thereof, or the premises surrounding any of these, fails to meet the provisions of this chapter, a compliance order setting forth the violations of this chapter and ordering the owner, occupant, operator, or agent to correct such violations shall be issued. This compliance order shall:
1. Be in writing.

Sent by first class mail to his/her last known address; or
c. Upon failure to provide notice through subsections (D)7a and (D)7b of this section, posted at a conspicuous place in or about the building, or portion thereof, that is affected by the notice.
8. State that violations may be cited by the City and prosecuted, and registration suspension, revocation or nonrenewal and other civil remedies may be undertaken by the City whether or not a compliance order has been issued.
(E) Action Plan: The compliance official may require an action plan to be completed by the registration holder, manager, or local agent in a designated time frame that indicates the steps taken to correct identified violations and the measures to be taken to ensure ongoing compliance with City ordinances and applicable codes.
(F) Right of Appeal: When it is alleged by any person to whom a compliance order is directed that such compliance order is based upon erroneous interpretation of this chapter, such person may appeal the compliance under section 2.99.
4.35.10 REGISTRATION SUSPENSION, REVOCATION, DENIAL, AND NONRENEWAL:
(A) Violations: The following actions by property owners or registration holders are misdemeanors punishable as set forth in State law and are subject to civil penalties, may constitute the basis for revocation of registrations, and may result in injunctive action by the city. The property owner shall be responsible for the conduct of its agents or employees while engaged in normal business activities on the registered premises. Any violation of this chapter shall be considered an act of the property owner or registration holder for purposes of registration revocation. If a registration is revoked it is unlawful for the owner to permit
occupancy of any rental unit or permit new occupancy of any vacant rental unit or any units that become vacant during registration revocation.

It is not necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to support a determination of disorderly use nor does the fact of dismissal or acquittal of such a criminal charge operate as a bar to adverse registration action under this section.

1. First Strike: Upon the occurrence of an alleged disorderly use, the Police or Fire Department shall inform the city administrator or designee of the suspected disorderly use. The city administrator or designee shall then send to the tenant, and registration holder, as appropriate, a written notice of the violation by mail. The registration holder shall be responsible to take action as appropriate to terminate the disorderly use.
2. Second Strike: If another instance of disorderly use takes place in the same unit or by the same tenant or guest within twelve (12) months of an incident for which a notice in subsection (B)1 of this section was given, the Police or Fire Department shall inform the city administrator or designee of the alleged violation. The city administrator or designee shall then send to the tenant, and registration holder, as appropriate, a written notice of the violation by mail. The registration holder shall be responsible to take action as appropriate to terminate the disorderly use.
3. Third Strike: If a third or more instance of disorderly use takes place in the same unit or by the same tenant or guest within twelve (12) months of an incident for which a notice in subsection (B)1 or (B)2 of this section or this subsection was given, the City shall notify the registration holder by mail of the violation and shall also require the registration holder to immediately undertake the process necessary to remove the tenant from the property. If the registration holder fails to comply with the requirements of this section within fourteen (14) days, this constitutes a property owner violation under subsection 4.35.10(B)5 of this chapter.
(C) Postponement of Penalty: An action to revoke or not renew a registration based upon violations of this section may be postponed or discontinued at any time if it appears that the registration holder has taken appropriate measures which will prevent further instances of disorderly use. No adverse registration action shall be imposed where the instance of disorderly use of registere premises occurred during the pendency of eviction proceedings (unlawful detainer) or within thirty (30) days of notice given by the registration holder to a tenant to vacate the premises, where the disorderly use was related to conduct by the tenant or by other occupants or guests of the tenant's unit. Eviction proceedings shall not be a bar to adverse registration action, however, unless the registration holder diligently pursues them.
(D) Standard of Review: A determination that the registere premises have been used in a disorderly manner as described in this section shall be made upon substantial evidence to support such a determination.
(E) Reapplication for Revoked Registration: Following the revocation of a registration for a unit, the property owner or former registration holder must wait for the expiration of the appropriate revocation term and then must apply for a new registration for the unit. Any unit revoked must be inspected at the property owner's expense prior to the reissuance of a registration.
4.35.12 HEARING ON DENIAL OR VIOLATION:
(A) Notice Of Action: If the city administrator or designee denies the issuance of a registration, or suspends, or revokes a registration, or imposes civil penalties as prescribed in this chapter, the city administrator or designee shall send to the applicant, or registration holder, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notice of the action, and the right to an appeal. Appeals shall be heard as set forth in section 2.99 of this Code.
(B) Default: If the applicant or registration holder has been provided written notice of the denial, nonrenewal, or violation and if no request for a hearing is filed within the ten (10) day period, then the denial under section 4.35.4 of this chapter or civil penalty or revocation imposed in section 4.35.10 of this chapter shall take immediate effect by default. The City administrator or designee shall mail notice of the denial, fine, suspension, or revocation to the applicant or registration holder. The city administrator shall investigate compliance with the denial or revocation.
(C) Continuing Obligations, Penalty: Revocation, suspension or nonrenewal of a registration shall not excuse the owner/registration holder from compliance with all terms of this section, this Code, and State laws for as long as any units in the facility are occupied. Failure to comply with all terms of this chapter during the term of revocation, suspension or nonrenewal is a misdemeanor and grounds for extension of the term of such revocation or suspension or continuation of nonrenewal, or for a decision not to reinstate the registration, notwithstanding any limitations on the period of suspension, revocation or nonrenewal specified in the City Council's written decision.
(D) New Registrations Prohibited: A person who has a rental registration revoked may not receive a rental registration for another property within the City for a period of one (1) year from the date of revocation. The person may continue to operate other currently registered rental properties if the properties are maintained in compliance with City codes and other applicable regulations.
4.35.13 REGISTRATION REINSTATEMENT OR REAPPLICATION:
(A) If a registration for a unit or building or lot has been revoked or suspended, the registration shall only be regranted if all violations are corrected.
