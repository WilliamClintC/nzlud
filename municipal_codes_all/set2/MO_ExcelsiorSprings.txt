necessary to take votes by roll call in a meeting of the public
governmental body, due to an emergency of the public body, with a
quorum of the members of the public body physically present and in
attendance and less than a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet, or
any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of the

as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall
separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt
material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies
provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to
the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt

the individual member of the public governmental body.
A. Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the
public and of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated attendance
by members of the public and at a time reasonably convenient to the
public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or
impractical. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special
access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.
B. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hours' notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public, the
nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal

the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with,
or uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.
C. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon
as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third (3rd) business
day following the date the request is received by the custodian of
records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a
certain format, the public body shall provide the records in the
requested format, if such format is available. If access to the public
record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed
explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest
time and date that the record will be available for inspection. This
period for document production may exceed three (3) days for
reasonable cause.
D. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon
request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is
denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of
the third (3rd) business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.
A. Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body
shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish copies of public
records subject to the following:
1. Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted
under Section 32.091, RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per
page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14)
inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the
average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records
requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based
on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall
produce the copies using employees of the body that result in the
lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the
person requesting the records may request the public
governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public
governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester.
2. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films,

time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for
staff of the public governmental body required for making copies
and programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or
other medium used for the duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints
or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the
actual rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to
duplicate such maps, blueprints or plats.
If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level
to comply with a request for records or information, the fees for
compliance may include the actual cost of such programming.

copies.

6. Such investments will be made in accordance with prevailing cash
management and investment policies which are promulgated and
administered by the Director of Finance. From time to time, such
policies will be refined and amended by the Director of Finance to
reflect current conditions prevailing in the cash management and
investment marketplace, thereby allowing the City to maintain an
appropriate posture relative to the contemporary financial
marketplace.
A. Under the authority of the City Manager of the City of Excelsior Springs
(as established and amended through the passage of ordinance and
resolution of the governing body), the Director of Finance is authorized
and required to make rules and regulations and to establish
administrative policies and procedures relating to the cash
management and investment policies of the City. To this end, this
statement of policies has been prepared.
B. It is anticipated that this policy statement will be reviewed and
evaluated on a regular basis, to ensure that the policies and procedures
expressed herein are responsive to the prevailing cash management
and investment environment. Since this environment is subject to
constant change, care must be taken to ensure that such
responsiveness is maintained. This policy statement will, therefore, be
appropriately revised, amended, expanded, and purged on a continuing
basis.
C. If any changes are contemplated which substantially alter the intent
and purpose of these policies, other than to effect further
administrative or procedural efficiencies, the Director of Finance will
discuss such changes with the City Manager.
A. In general, the cash management and investment activities of the City
of Excelsior Springs shall be conducted in a manner which is consistent
with prevailing prudent business practices which may be applied by
other organizations of similar size and financial resources, in
compliance with appropriate State Statutes.
B. Investments of the City, or of funds held in its possession in a fiduciary
capacity, shall be made with the exercise of that judgement and care,
under circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence,
discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the
probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable income to be
derived.

F. Securities dealers with whom the City conducts business shall be
subject to established guidelines and criteria.
G. The City will limit its purchase of investment securities to those which

United States government, obligations of United States government
agencies, or the purchase of such U.S. government of agency securities
under the terms of repurchase agreements.
A. The Department of Finance is committed to the overall success of the
City's cash management programs. These programs address a variety
of cash management issues, including:
1. The design and implementations of reliable and effective cash-flow
forecasting methodologies which will assist Finance Department
personnel in the determination of the amounts of cash available for
investment, the time period for which the funds may be invested
with a reasonable level of confidence, and a measure of the
volatility of specific forecasts, which will allow viable determination
of the required liquidity which must characterize the specific
investments.
2. The design and implementation of appropriate "revenue
acceleration" programs, aimed at enhancing the speed at which
monies are collected and deposited.
3. The design and implementation of suitable "controlled
disbursement" programs, which will ensure that City expenses are
met in a timely manner, but not in such a way as to jeopardize the
earning capacity of the City's cash management portfolio.

movement of money, taking advantage of the technological and
operational procedures which have evolved in recent years.
5. The design of investment policies which will allow the City to

policies and procedures which will ensure the total safety of all
funds entrusted to the care and control of the Finance Department.
6. The design and implementation of banking relationships which are
both favorable to the City and responsive to the day-to-day
requirements of the City's complex financial operations.
7. The design and implementation of appropriate policies and
procedures with regard to the proper and effective use of City's
municipal credit authority.
A. The statement, "Investments . shall be made with the exercise of that
judgement and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which men
of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of
their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering
the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be
derived," imposes a wide variety of responsibilities upon the
Department of Finance. These responsibilities include, but are not
limited to: The need for prudence and care in the selection of
appropriate investment securities; the need for rational criteria for the
selection of financial institutions and securities dealers with whom the
City conducts business; and a distinct concentration upon the
maximization of investment yield within the parameters of the other
listed responsibilities. To meet these responsibilities, the Department of
Finance has established the following policies and procedures for cash
investment:
1. Investment instruments. The Director of Finance, or designee, shall
invest the temporarily idle funds of the City in those investment
instruments which are listed below:
a. Fully-collateralized Certificates of Deposit issued by qualified
commercial banks and savings and loan associations located
within the State. The term "qualified" is explained more fully in
Subsection (2) hereof.
b. Deposits in the State's "Local Government Investment Pool",
only if authorized by State Statutes.
c. Direct obligations of the United States government, including
such instruments as Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes, and
Treasury Bonds.
Section
135.040
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
135.050
I Notes:73
d. Other "direct obligations", while fully guaranteed by the "full
faith and credit" of the United States government, enjoy less
active secondary markets than the more traditional bills, notes,
and bonds. Therefore, the Finance Department will currently
refrain from purchasing such instruments as SBA loans, AID
bonds, "stripped" Treasury Bonds, etc., unless special
circumstances prevail which suggest their appropriate use for
specific investments. The "special circumstances" will be fully
documented at the time of their purchase and the City Council
will be notified.
e. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies, including such
instruments as Federal Home Loan Bank bonds, Government
National Mortgage Association bonds, or a variety of "Federal
Farm Credit" bonds.
f. Purchases of the "direct" or "agency" securities mentioned in
paragraphs (3) and (4) above, under the terms of a repurchase
agreement which meets the procedures established in part (c)
of this Subsection.
g. In no event will any investment vehicle be selected and utilized
until the Director of Finance is fully convinced that
departmental personnel have full familiarity with the nature
and nuances of the specific investment vehicle. Furthermore,
the Director of Finance will endeavor to make available
whatever professional training is necessary to assist
departmental personnel in the performance of their cash
management duties and responsibilities.
h. Generally, the City will only invest in "money market
instruments", which are defined as very credit worthy, highly
liquid investments with maturities of one year or less. Although
there may be certain circumstances in which longer-term
securities are utilized, such as investments of long-term
sinking fund contributions, or maturity-matched construction
funds, the general use of long-term securities shall be avoided.
(Such instruments are generally inappropriate to the City's
cash management operations, since the purchase of such
securities infers certain level of "speculation", given the
significant "market risks" which characterize long-term
investments.)
2. Criteria for selection of financial intermediaries. Although the
City's policies for the purchase of investment securities are
designed to ensure complete safety, accompanied by appropriate
liquidity and competitive yields, the "providers" of such securities
must also meet specific financial and operational standards.
Deposits in commercial banks and savings and loan associations,
whether they be time deposits, demand deposits, or deposits in
Section
135.050
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
135.050
I Notes:74
special interest-bearing accounts, ("NOW", "Super-NOW", etc.),
shall only be made in banks which qualify to accept public-sector
deposits which are protected under the terms of Chapter 110,
RSMo.
However, certain "sweep" or "automatic repo" accounts, and
certain funds held under the terms of a "trust agreement"
arrangement may not be protected under the provisions of Chapter
110, RSMo.
Furthermore, the City has no desire to "test" such program as
FDIC or FSLIC insurance, nor does it wish to have to establish
its legal right to securities held by financially-insolvent brokers or
securities dealers. There are a sufficiently large number of financial
institutions and securities dealers which are of impeccable
financial standing. As a result, the City does not choose to do
business with "marginal" or financially-weak institutions.
Therefor, financial intermediaries which conduct business with the
City of Excelsior Springs shall be subject to the following types of
selection criteria:
a. Commercial banks. Deposits of City monies in commercial
banks may only be made with institutions which possess the
overall financial strength, capitalization, and liquidity to
reasonably ensure the safety and availability of such monies.
To assess the overall financial strength of potential
depositories, the City will utilize third-party rating agencies to
perform periodic reviews of various commercial banks, relying
upon their reports to determine the appropriateness of the
depository.
Currently, the City uses the services of Prudent Man Analysis,
Inc. (PMA) to rate the strength of the commercial banks with
which the City does business. Inasmuch as PMA utilizes overall
ratings of one (1) through five (5), (one (1) being strongest.
five (5) being weakest), the City's current policy is to seek
depositories with a PMA rating of one (1) or two (2). Banks
with ratings of three (3) shall be eligible to serve as a
depository, but must be periodically and substantively
reviewed. Banks rated in the four (4) or five (5) category will
not qualify to receive City monies.
b. Savings and loan associations. Deposits of City monies in
savings and loan associations shall be subject to the same
rating criteria which are applied to commercial banks. Their
acceptability as depositories will be judged on the third-party
ratings of such organizations as PMA or its counterparts.
c. Securities dealers. There are currently thirty-six (36) major
investment banking firms which are listed by the market
Reports Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as
Section
135.050
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
135.050
I Notes:75
the thirty-six (36) "primary" securities dealers. These dealers
are unique within the United States government securities
industry in that they both "report" and are "regulated" in an
industry which is typically "non-reporting" and "unregulated".
Included on this "blue chip" list are major securities firms
(Prudential-Bache, Dean Witter Reynolds, Merrill Lynch, Smith
Barney, etc.) and some of the world's largest banks (Bank of
America, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, Northern Trust,
etc.).
Current Department of Finance policy is to restrict
transactions relating to the purchase and sale of U.S.
Government securities to this list of "primary" securities
dealers. Such policy, therefor, will preclude the City from doing
business with other brokers and dealers whose financial
strength and operational capabilities cannot be confidently
determined, given the absence of "reporting" and "regulation"
requirements.
This policy may seem unduly restrictive. However, the City
policy is to "err on the side of prudence", rather than accept
event the smallest risk of loss of principal or interest.
3. Procedures for the delivery and possession of securities. It provides
insufficient protection for the City to simply limit its cash
investments to those listed in (a) of this Subsection. To ensure total
protection, the City has established delivery and possession
procedures which will be followed in every case. Specifically:
a. All ownership of securities shall be evidenced by an acceptable
safekeeping receipt issued by a third-party financial institution
which is acceptable to the City, or by a safekeeping receipt
from the Federal Reserve Bank.
b. All investment (or divestment) transactions will be
implemented on a "delivery vs. payment" (or "payment vs.
delivery") basis. In the absence of acceptable delivery, the City
will refuse to enter the transaction.
c. Repurchase agreements will meet the aforementioned delivery
criteria, and will be accompanied by an acceptable "haircut"
(i.e., excess of market value of securities over principal amount
of investment.)
Furthermore, securities purchased under the terms of a
repurchase agreement shall generally have maturity dates of
ten (10) years or less, and shall be "wirable" instruments
through the U.S. Federal Reserve System.
d. From time to time, the City may choose to "reverse" certain of
its portfolio securities under the terms of a "reverse

Editor's Note: Former Chapter 140, Airports, containing Sections

Chapter 145
repurchase agreement". However, this authority shall be
severely restricted.
The primary rationale for "reversing" is to provide short-term
liquidity which is less costly than permanent liquidation of a
portfolio security. This method can be utilized to "temporarily
liquidate" many types of securities, including CDs, U.S.
government obligations, U.S. agency obligations, etc.
(In the case of local CDs, a "temporary reverse" or "reverse
to maturity" may allow the City to legally avoid any "early
withdrawal penalties", thereby preserving the City's
investment capital. In the case of government or agency
securities, a "temporary reverse" may allow the City to avoid
liquidation of a desirable instrument in a "disadvantageous"
marketplace.
However, the City will not utilize "reverse" as a tool to effect
"margined purchases" of investment securities, nor as an
action which will essentially " disguise" or "cover up"
unrecognized portfolio losses. Finally the City will not utilize
"reverses" to engage in any types of "speculative" investment
transactions.
e. All wire transactions required to implement the
aforementioned purchase and sale transactions shall be
supported by written instructions to the City's bank, unless the
timely preparation of such written instructions would hinder
the orderly completion of the transaction itself. In such cases,
the City will prepare follow-up letters confirming the oral
(typically telephonic) instructions, and forward such written
instructions to the bank without undue delay.
The Finance Department will, from time to time, recommend
to the governing body various financing opportunities which
should be of ultimate financial and operational benefit to the
City and its taxpayers. The Department will constantly monitor
the City's existing and potential financing alternatives to
ensure that full advantage is being taken of the special taxexempt
municipal financing authority the City.

taxes for a period of not less than ten (10) years following the date such
improvements are first assessed, but in any event no later than twenty-

F. As used in Subsection (E) of this Section, "truck" means any vehicle,
machine, tractor, trailer, or semitrailer, or any combination thereof,
propelled or drawn by mechanical power and designed for or used in
the transportation of property upon the highways. The term "truck" also
includes a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Section 300.010 of
this Title.
A. The following rules shall govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles
proceeding in the same direction, subject to the limitations and
exceptions hereinafter stated:
1. The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance and
shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until safely
clear of the overtaken vehicle; and
2. Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the
driver of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of
the overtaking vehicle and shall not increase the speed of such
driver's vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.
B. The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass to the right of
another vehicle only under the following conditions:
1. When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
2. Upon a City street with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width

Section 340.190. Hand and Mechanical Signals.
D. No vehicle shall at any time be driven to the left side of the roadway
under the following conditions:
1. When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve of the
highway where the driver's view is obstructed within such distance
as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle might approach
from the opposite direction.
2. When the view is obstructed upon approaching within one hundred
(100) feet of any bridge, viaduct, tunnel or when approaching
within one hundred (100) feet of or at any intersection or railroad
grade crossing.
A. No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle
from a direct course or move right or left upon a roadway unless and
until such movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only
after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
1. An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed
of the operator's vehicle if the movement of other vehicles may
reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall extend
such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same
may be seen in the rear of the vehicle.
2. An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle above horizontal so that the
same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the vehicle and shall
slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as
practicable to the right side of the highway along which such
operator is proceeding before turning.
3. An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall
extend such operator's arm in a horizontal position so that the

highway along which the operator is proceeding before turning.
4. The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the
hand and arm or by a signal light or signal device in good
mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a
hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear
of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by such light or
device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded
that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front
and rear when the distance from the center of the top of the
steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load
exceeds twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the

center of the top of the steering post to the rear limit of the body
or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles.
The provisions of this Subsection shall not apply to any trailer
which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand signals of the
operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such
trailer; provided further, that the provisions of this Section as far
as mechanical devices on vehicles so constructed that a hand and
arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such
vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles
registered within this State after the first (1st) day of January,
1954.
A. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking
from either direction any school bus which has stopped on the highway
for the purpose of receiving or discharging any school children and
whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to
stop shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not
proceed until such school bus resumes motion or until signaled by its
driver to proceed.
B. Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon
the front and rear thereon a plainly visible sign containing the words
"School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in height. Each bus
shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following:
"State Law: Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus
subject to the provisions of Sections 304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall
be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device approved
by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly
visible from the front and rear and indicating intention to stop.
C. Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school
system which has a gross vehicle weight rating of more than ten
thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted entirely in
front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels,
and which is used for the transportation of school children shall be
equipped with a crossing control arm. The crossing control arm, when
activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from the
face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on
the right side of the front bumper and shall be activated by the same
controls which activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices
described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all
other Missouri school children who have been injured or killed during
the operation of a school bus.
D. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus
in the process of loading or unloading students upon a street or
highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices,
Section
340.190
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
340.200
I Notes:363
in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to
communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or
unloading. A public school district has the authority pursuant to Section
304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of
a school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner
as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic;
nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle
is upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and
a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different
roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway
containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a
loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or
controlled access highway at a point where pedestrians are not
permitted to cross the roadway.
F. If any vehicle is witnessed by a Police Officer or the driver of a school
bus to have violated the provisions of Subsection (A) of this Section and
the identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, it shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the person in whose name such vehicle is
registered committed the violation. In the event that charges are filed
against multiple owners of a motor vehicle, only one (1) of the owners
may be convicted and court costs may be assessed against only one (1)
of the owners. If the vehicle which is involved in the violation is
registered in the name of a rental or leasing company and the vehicle is
rented or leased to another person at the time of the violation, the
rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing the
peace officer or prosecuting authority with a copy of the rental or lease
agreement in effect at the time of the violation. The prosecuting
authority may not bring any legal proceedings against a rental or
leasing company under this Section unless prior written notice of the

B. Planned Zoning Districts. Each of the districts hereinbefore set forth
excepting Districts "RMP" and "C-2A" shall have a separate and distinct
counterpart known and herein referred to as a Planned District. A
Planned District shall be for the purpose of permitting and regulating
the uses heretofore permitted in the equivalent district and further
provide for and encourage latitude and flexibility in the location of
buildings, structures, roads, drives, variations in yards and open
spaces, all subsequent to approval of the plan by local officials. The
purpose is to allow development of tracts of land to their fullest extent
and at the same time observe the general intent and spirit of these
regulations.
Planned Districts shall be as follows:
District
"RP-1A"
— Planned Single-Family Residential District.

Districts ("RP-1" to "MP-2", inclusive) shall be for the purpose of
requiring orderly development on a quality level generally equal to that
of the equivalent Standard Zoning Districts, but permitting variations
from the normal and established development techniques. The use of
planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage large scale
development tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning,
conservation of natural resources and minimum waste of land. The
following are specific conditions and objectives of planned zoning:
1. A proposal to rezone land to a Planned District shall be subject to
the same criteria relative to compliance with master plans, land use
policies, neighborhood compatibility, adequacy of streets and
utilities and other elements, as is normal in rezoning deliberations.
Section
400.060
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
400.060
I Notes:460
2. The submittal by the developer and the approval by the City of
development plans represent a firm commitment by the developer
that development will indeed follow the approved plans in concept,
intensity of use, aesthetic levels and quantities of open space.
3. Deviations in yard requirements, setbacks and relationship
between buildings are acceptable and may be approved within the
limits set out in "Standards of Development" in this Section, if it is
deemed that other amenities or conditions will be gained to the
extent that an equal or higher quality of development will result
than under standard zoning procedures.
4. Residential areas will be planned and developed in a manner that
will produce more usable open space, better recreational
opportunities, safer and more attractive neighborhoods than under
standard zoning and development techniques.
5. Commercial areas will be planned and developed so as to result in
attractive, viable and safe centers and clusters, as opposed to strip
patters along thoroughfares. Control of vehicular access,
architectural quality, landscaping and signs will be exercised to
soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods, and to
assure minimum adverse effects on the street system and other
services of the community.
6. The developer will be given latitude in using innovative techniques
in the development of land not feasible under application of
standard zoning requirements.
7. Planned zoning shall not be used as a refuge from the requirements
of the equivalent district as to intensity of land use, amount of open
space or other established development criteria.
8. No use will be permitted in the Planned District that is not clearly
permitted in the equivalent district.
9. Any building or portion thereof may be owned in condominium
under appropriate Missouri Statutes.
D. Standards Of Development In Planned Zoning Districts.
1. The maximum height of buildings and structures shall be as set out
in the equivalent district.
2. The intensity of land use, the floor area and bulk of buildings, the
concentration of population, the percentage of lot coverage, the
amount of open space, light and air shall be generally equal to that
required in the equivalent Zoning District.
3. The density of residential dwelling units, the parking requirements
and the performance standards shall be the same as in the
equivalent district.
Section
400.060
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
400.060
I Notes:461
4. The permitted uses shall be the same as those permitted in the
equivalent district, provided that limitations may be placed on the
occupancy of certain premises, if such limitation is deemed
essential to the health, safety or general welfare of the community.
5. The Planning and Zoning Commission may, in the process of
approving preliminary and final plans, approve deviations from the
minimum standards in the equivalent district as follows:
a. Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a public street may
be reduced to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Chapter
requirement.
b. Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a property line of
the project (other than a street line) may be reduced to eightyfive
percent (85%) of the Chapter requirements.
c. Side yards between buildings may be reduced to zero.
d. A portion of the parking area required under this Chapter may
remain unimproved until such time as the City Council deems
it must be improved to serve the demand adequately.
The foregoing deviations may be granted by the Planning and
Zoning Commission only where there is ample evidence that
said deviation will not adversely affect neighboring property,
nor will it constitute the mere granting of a privilege.
Reduction of setbacks or other open space shall be
compensated by additional open space in other appropriate
portions of the project. In all cases such deviations shall be
in keeping with good land planning principles, and must be
specifically set out in the minutes of the Commission, as well
as on plans and other exhibits in the record.
E. Procedures. The procedure for zoning land to a Planned District shall
be as set out in Section 404.090.
F. Conformance To Master Plan. In the consideration of a change to a
Planned Zoning District, the Planning and Zoning Commission and
governing body shall determine whether the proposal conforms to
master plans, special studies and policies normally utilized in making
zoning decisions in the City of Excelsior Springs.
G. Map. The location and boundaries of the districts established by this
Chapter are set forth in the "Zoning District Map," which is hereby
made a part of this Chapter. The said map, together with everything
shown thereon and all amendments thereto, shall be as much a part of
this Chapter as though fully set forth and described herein. The said
map shall be filed with the Office of the City Clerk and copies thereof in
the Office of the Building Official, and shall be open to public reference
at all times during which those offices are open.

A. Purpose. The development and administration of the Zoning Code is
based on the division of the City into districts, within any one (1) of
which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of
buildings or structures, as related to land, are essentially uniform. It is
recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of
unique character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district
or districts without consideration, in each case of the impact of those
uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the
particular use or the particular location. Such special uses fall into
three (3) categories:
1. Uses operated by a public agency or public-related utilities, or uses
traditionally affected with a public interest; and
2. Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities; and
3. Uses which are of a short duration and short range impact on the
community.
B. Authorization. Special uses may be authorized only by the City Council,
provided that no application for a special use shall be acted upon by the
City Council until after a public hearing is scheduled and notice posted
and thereafter held by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and its
finding and recommendations are reported to the City Council.
C. Application. An application for special use shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. Such application shall proceed in the manner prescribed
herein for amendments to this Chapter. (See Section 404.080)
D. Standards. No special use shall be granted unless the use:
1. Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location;
2. Is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated that the public
health, safety, and welfare will be protected; and
3. Will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in
the neighborhood in which it is located; and
4. Will comply with the height and area regulations of the district in
which it is located unless specifically granted otherwise.
E. Conditions. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and
the City Council may provide such conditions and restrictions upon the
construction, location, and operation of a special use including time
limit provision for off-street parking and loading and other conditions as
may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of this
Chapter and to minimize any injury to the value of property in the
neighborhood. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as
may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
permit for such special use.

interference or other hazards.

dead.
4. Clubs.

Service Business District. This special use permit shall be valid for
a period not to exceed two (2) years, but may be renewed after a

provided the following conditions are met:

description of the proposed activity, hours of operation, ability
to accommodate Fire and Police services and access, need for
special protection and other characteristics that may affect the
public safety, convenience and welfare.

A. Purpose And Intent.

have special characteristics and impacts upon their surroundings,
and upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties.
2. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations to provide for the
confinement of adult entertainment establishments to those
commercial areas within which the special characteristics and
impacts are judged to be the least disruptive to the use and
enjoyment of adjacent properties and neighborhoods.
3. These regulations are further intended to require that adult
entertainment establishments shall not be permitted to locate in
such concentration that their operational features may establish
the dominant character of any commercial area or to be a blighting
influence on the surrounding neighborhood(s).

NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
400.235
I Notes:499
4. The special regulation of adult entertainment establishments is
deemed to be necessary to ensure that the special characteristics
and impacts of such uses will not contribute to the blighting or
degradation of surrounding neighborhoods, whether residential or

stability of such neighborhoods.
5. These regulations are further intended to protect and balance the
lawful rights of expression with the lawful rights to the enjoyment

F. Improvement Of Parking Areas. All parking areas and drives, except as
herein provided, shall be ready for use upon occupying a building. The
City may grant an extension by issuing a temporary certificate of
occupancy when weather conditions are not satisfactory for placing
paving materials. All locations of parking lot and driveway accesses to
City streets will be subject to approval by the City on consideration of
sight triangles and setback from intersections. In addition the following
regulations shall apply:
1. Pavement, curbs and marking standards. Parking lots and
driveways shall be paved with a dust free, all weather surface such
as asphaltic concrete (AC) or Portland Cement Concrete (PCC
4,000 psi minimum) and meet all of the City's construction
standards (KC-APWA). The minimum thickness shall be as follows:
a. Driveways serving single through four family dwellings shall
be surfaced with either asphalt or concrete as follows:
(1) Asphalt standard. Three (3) inches of hot mix asphalt on a
minimum of four (4) inch crushed stone aggregate base.
(2) Concrete standard. Six (6) inches of concrete placed on
the ROW, with four (4) inches placed on private property.
b. Parking lots and driveways serving other than single family
through four family dwellings:
(1) Asphalt standard. Five (5) inches of asphalt over six (6)
inches of compacted aggregate stone base.
(2) Concrete standard. Six (6) inches of (PCC) on a minimum
of four (4) inches of compacted stone base.
c. In any fill areas where a parking lot is constructed, the sub
grade shall be compacted to 95% Maximum Standard Density
and compaction test shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department for verification. In parking lot areas
where fire access lanes are needed, the pavement must be
constructed to support the imposed loads of fire apparatus
weighing at least 75,000 pounds. All drives and parking areas
shall have curbs (except those serving one through four family
dwellings) and all curbing shall meet the City's construction
standards (KC-APWA). All spaces shall be marked, with
disabled spaces having special pavement marking in each
space per ADA guidelines. Directional entrances, loading
zones, and exit aisles shall be signed and marked on pavement.
2. Alternate permanent paving standards.
a. The Community Development Department may approve
alternatives to AC or PCC paving on private property.
Alternative paving materials, when installed according to
Section
400.280
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
400.280
I Notes:517
manufacturer's specifications, shall provide a suitable, all
weather, load-bearing surface to support passenger cars and
light duty trucks. Alternative paving materials for driveways or
parking lots serving large commercial vehicles or fire trucks
must be designed to accommodate a maximum vehicle weight
of 75,000 pounds. Alternative paving materials over City utility
easements will not be repaired or maintained by the City.
b. The City may approve such alternative paving to achieve
aesthetic and environmental objectives, such as improved
appearance, increased water percolation, reduced erosion and
runoff, increased aeration and water for tree roots, and
increased area available for landscaping, upon finding that the
alternative paving will provide public aesthetics or
environmental benefits, and is equal to or better than ACC or
PCC paving in terms of public safety, performance, strength,
quality and durability. Examples of permanent alternative
paving surfaces include, but are not limited to: interlocking
pavers, porous AC and PCC paving, cobblestone, or other
material judged by the City to be of equivalent performance,
strength, quality and durability.
3. Geometries. The minimum allowable inside vehicle turning radius
in parking and driveway areas shall be twenty (20) feet unless fire
apparatus access is necessary, in which case all dimensions will
follow the International Fire Code or as required by the Fire
Department. Turning radii are not necessarily the radii of curbs
around all islands and other improvements. Parking spaces which
back directly onto the public street shall be set back a minimum of
twenty (20) feet from the back of the right of way, regardless of the
zoning of the property to prevent vehicles from parking on the right
of way. No portion of any parking space, except driveways for
ingress and egress, shall be permitted on the right of way.
4. Walls, walkways, entrances and wheel stops. A parking space
facing a wall containing entrances and abutting a walkway to those
entrances must be at least four (4) feet clear of such a wall. A
parking space facing a building wall containing entrances and
abutting a walkway to those entrances must be at least four (4) feet
clear of the wall and must have bollards no less than five (5) feet
apart or other barrier approved by the Community Development
Department sufficient to prevent vehicle incursion into the
walkway by a vehicle weighing up to 4,500 pounds and traveling up
to thirty (30) miles per hour. Wheel stops or bollards may be
required if the space is headed into a wall, fence, landscaped area,
building, or side of another auto in addition to curbing.
5. Overhangs and encroachments. All parking spaces must be clear of
overhangs and encroachments which might interfere with
vehicular access.

6. Maneuvering. Parking lots with more than six (6) spaces shall be
designed so that vehicles will exit onto a public street in a forward
direction and with no more than two (2) maneuvers. A maneuver is
defined as each motion in either a forward or backward direction.
No space will be allowed that requires a vehicle to maneuver onto
the public sidewalk in order to exit. All spaces must be designed to
enter in one (1) maneuver. A turnaround may be required if it is
considered unsafe for a vehicle to back into the street. Commercial
and industrial parking lots serving loading zones shall be designed
to accommodate access and circulation movements for on-site
truck circulation. The City may require wider driveways and aisles
as determined and warranted.
7. Slope. Parking spaces shall slope no more than 5% in any direction
and no less than .5% in the direction of drainage. A maximum of
10% slope in aisles and turning areas may be allowed. Any drainage
swale of less than 1% slope shall be concrete.
8. Loading zones. Off-street loading zones shall be a minimum of
twelve (12) feet wide and twenty-five (25) feet long. Loading zones
shall be designed so that trucks parking in them will not encroach
onto the public right of way or required parking spaces or
driveways. Loading spaces designed for large trucks shall have
appropriately larger access to allow for maneuvering without
encroaching into landscape areas. Loading zones or areas shall not
encroach into fire lanes.
9. Lighting. All parking lots with more than four (4) parking spaces
shall be lighted to one foot- candle per square foot minimum. All
lighting shall be directed away from adjacent residential homes.
10. Abandoned driveways. As a condition of any right of way permit, all
abandoned driveways on the same property shall be removed,
landscaped and the curb, gutter and sidewalk properly restored.
11. All improved parking areas and drives shall be designed with
approved drainage facilities according to City construction
standards (KC-APWA).
12. Parking lot maintenance. It shall be the duty of the property owner
to maintain and repair the parking lot and driveway improvements
in accordance with the standards to which they were designed.
Such parking areas shall be replaced or resurfaced should they
become cracked, broken, or deteriorated to the extent it creates a
nuisance according to the Property Maintenance Code. Any
expansion or new construction of parking lots or drives shall
comply with Section 400.280(F)(1) of this City Code.
13. Common access driveways. Common access driveways may be
permitted in new subdivisions where a common driveway is
proposed as part of the subdivision approval. The driveway must
meet all applicable codes for the location of the drive and it must be

I Notes:519
determined that there is no significant potential for conflict
between the parties sharing the driveway because of its location,
length, grade, usage, or other characteristics.
a. For residential use. Before granting any permit authorizing the
construction of a common access driveway or structures to be
served by said driveway, the City shall require an easement to
be filed with the County recorder setting forth driveway usage
rights and responsibilities for each parcel served. At minimum,
the required easement shall include the following statements:
(1) All Affected property owners will be jointly responsible for
the improvement and maintenance of all parts of the
common access driveway.
(2) All parking on the commonly used portions of the driveway
is prohibited.
(3) If the easement is abandoned or dissolved, each lot
previously served by the common access driveway shall be
provided with standard access as required by these
regulations.
The driveway shall serve no more than four (4)
residential units unless special circumstances
warrant the grant of an exception by the City.
b. For commercial and industrial use. Before granting any permit
authorizing the construction of any common access driveway
to serve the premises zoned or used for commercial or
industrial purposes, the City may impose the requirements
listed above for residential uses as well as any additional
requirements or conditions it deems necessary or appropriate.
14. In Districts "R-1" to "R-5" inclusive, no parking shall be permitted
in the required front yard or within ten (10) feet of a public street,
except that parking of motor passenger cars shall be permitted in
customary driveways of single and two-family dwellings. No
parking shall be permitted within six (6) feet of an adjoining lot line
15. In District "C-O" no parking area in a front yard shall extend closer

a corner lot shall extend closer than four (4) feet to a street. In
Districts "C-1" to "M-2" no parking area shall extend closer than
four (4) feet to a street, measured to the back of the curb of the
parking area.
16. Where greater setback requirements do not prevail, the back of the
curb of a paved parking area shall be no closer than four (4) feet to
a property line, except that in a Planned Zoning District, the
Planning Commission and Council may permit a lesser setback
Section
400.280
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
400.280
I Notes:520
where similar development on an adjoining lot will produce a
satisfactory relationship.
17. Screening and landscaping. All open automobile parking areas in
Districts "C-O" to "M-2" containing more than four (4) parking
spaces shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or
fronting on any residential or institutional property by a wall or

The area between such wall and or fence shall be landscaped. In all
parking lots, planting areas shall be generally provided at the end
of each row of parking. Landscape areas shall have a minimum
width dimension of four (4) feet, except those areas with trees shall
be a minimum of eight (8) feet wide. Landscape areas shall be
defined by concrete curbing. Landscaped areas defining ends of
rows shall extend to the minimum inside turn radius. A minimum of
5% of the parking surface shall be committed to landscaping. All
landscaped areas shall be maintained and all dead plants shall be
replaced as necessary. All irrigation in landscaped areas must have
backflow control devices.
18. Land areas used for the storage, display, temporary keeping of
mobile equipment shall be surfaced in a manner deemed adequate
by the City. The criteria used to determine surfacing requirements
will depend upon the incidence of dust, erosion, maintenance,
appearance, surface water ponding, length of time and intensity of
use.
19. Lots in existing subdivisions in which paved driveways were/are not
required, MAY be exempt from the requirement in the following
instances:
a. Where the majority of the lots which contain residential
structures, exclusive of the frontage, do not have paved
driveways, the owner shall have the option to pave the
driveways with concrete or asphalt as part of a home
improvement that does not include a new garage or garage
addition. Driveways shall be installed with concrete or asphalt
as part of a home improvement that includes a new garage or a
garage addition. If any existing gravel driveway in a residential
or commercial area is extended or replaced, it shall be
replaced with concrete or asphalt.
b. Where an existing residential structure with an unpaved
driveway abuts a subdivision where a majority of the driveways
are already paved, the owner shall be required to pave the
driveway as part of a home improvement project that includes
a new garage or a garage addition.
c. In older areas or where lots of more than one (1) acre exists,
the owner shall pave the first fifty (50) feet of a driveway, such

8-2-2019]
disapproval of a permit for reason of unacceptable landscape
planning the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning
Commission for review and final decision.
A. Purpose And Intent.
1. Medical marijuana facilities are hereby acknowledged to be lawful
under Article XVI, Section 1 of the Missouri Constitution and to
have special characteristics and impacts upon their surroundings,
and upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties.
2. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations to provide for the
location of medical marijuana facilities in the areas within which
the special characteristics and impacts are judged to be compatible
with other permitted uses and be the least disruptive to the use and
enjoyment of adjacent properties and neighborhoods.
3. These regulations are further intended to require that medical
marijuana facilities shall not be permitted to locate in such
concentration that their operational features may establish the
dominant character of any commercial area or to be a blighting
influence on the surrounding neighborhood(s).
4. The special regulation of medical marijuana facilities is deemed to
be necessary to ensure that the special characteristics and impacts
of such uses will not contribute to the blighting or degradation of
surrounding neighborhoods, whether residential or non-residential
by location or concentration and to ensure the stability of such
neighborhoods.
5. These regulations are further intended to protect and balance the
lawful rights to produce and dispense medical marijuana with the
lawful rights to the enjoyment and use of property.
6. These regulations are necessary to protect the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the residents of the City of Excelsior
Springs, Missouri.
B. Definitions. The words and phrases when used in this Section shall have
the meaning set out under Article XVI, Section 1 of the Missouri
Constitution and the Regulations of the Missouri Department of Health
and Senior Services.
C. General Requirements.
1. All medical marijuana facilities shall comply with all provisions of
the Excelsior Springs Municipal Code; including International
Building, Electrical, Gas, Plumbing and Fire Codes as adopted and
amended by the City.
Section
400.290
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section

2. All medical marijuana facilities shall comply with the requirements
of the Zoning District in which the facility is located.
3. All medical marijuana facilities shall be properly licensed by the
Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and shall
comply with all regulations and orders of the Department at all
times.
D. Conditions.
1. A Medical Marijuana Dispensary Facility shall be located only in a
"C-2" General Business District, "C-3" Service Business District, or
"M-1'' Light Industrial District. Medical Marijuana Testing
Facilities, Transportation Facilities, Infused Products
Manufacturing Facilities and Cultivation Facilities shall be located
only in the "M-1" Light Industrial and "M-2" General Industrial
Districts.
2. No medical marijuana facility shall be permitted to locate within
one thousand (1,000) feet of any religious institution, school, or
licensed day-care or youth facility. In the case of a freestanding
facility, the distance between the facility and any religious
institution, school, or licensed day-care or youth facility shall be
measured from the external wall of the facility structure closest in
proximity to the religious institution, school, or licensed day-care or
youth facility to the closest point of the property line of the
religious institution, school, or licensed day-care or youth facility. If
the religious institution, school, or licensed day-care or youth
facility school, day-care is part of a larger structure, such as an
office building or strip mall, the distance shall be measured to the
entrance or exit of the religious institution, school, or licensed daycare
or youth facility closest in proximity to the facility.

A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The flood hazard
areas of the City of Excelsior Springs are subject to inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
B. General Causes Of These Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused
by:

Section 401.030. Statement of Purpose. [R.O. 2012 §401.030; Ord.
No. 88-10-2 §34, 10-3-1988; Ord. No. 03-4-4, 4-7-2003]
1. The cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases
in flood heights and velocities;
2. The occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the
depth of inundation.
The base flood selected for this Chapter is representative of large
floods known to have occurred in this region and which are
reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general
order of a flood which could be expected to occur, on the average,
once every one hundred (100) years, or has a one percent (1%)
chance of occurrence in any one (1) year, as delineated on the
Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS and illustrative materials
dated August 3, 2015, as amended, and to any future revisions
thereto. [Ord. No. 15-07-08 §2, 7-20-2015]
2. Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
3. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within no obstruction
is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height.
5. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the
base flood.
D. Adoption Of Studies. The Flood Insurance Study dated August 3, 2015,
and the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and the
Flood Insurance Rate Map are hereby adopted and are incorporated by
reference in this Chapter and any amendments and/or revisions thereto
which may hereafter be published. [Ord. No. 15-07-08 §2,

A. Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize those losses
described in Section 401.020(A); to maintain the community's eligibility
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as
defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to
meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of
this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
height or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the
time of initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard; and
4. To assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
A. Land to Which Chapter Applies. This Chapter shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the City of Excelsior Springs, Missouri
identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones on the
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for Clay County on map panels

August 3, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all
areas covered by this Chapter, no development shall be permitted
except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit
granted by the Director of Planning and Zoning under the provisions
established in Chapter 404. [Ord. No. 15-07-08 §3, 7-20-2015]
B. The Floodplain Administrator. The Director of Planning and Zoning of
the City is hereby designated as the Floodplain Administrator under
this Chapter.
C. Rules For Interpretation Of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Floodway and Floodway Fringe Overlay Districts shall be determined
by reviewing the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, the Flood
Insurance Study or other available data. Where interpretation is needed
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts, the Director of
Planning and Zoning shall maintain the Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map, Flood Insurance Study and other engineering studies relating to
flood data. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the
Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) will resolve the dispute. The owner

No. 90-4-4 §1, 4-16-1989]
3. The ESHP Commission shall review and comment upon any
proposed acquisition of a Landmark or of land or buildings within a
Historic District by the City of Excelsior Springs or any of its
agencies or departments. The City Council or the Community
Development Department shall, at the earliest possible date that
will not interfere with acquisition negotiations, send the ESHP
Commission information concerning the location, size, purchase
price, current use, and proposed use of the land or building to be
acquired, and specify the date by which the ESHP Commission
shall report to the City Council.
4. The ESHP Commission shall review the public improvement or land
acquisition project to determine its effect upon the historic or
architectural character of the Landmark or Historic District and
report to the City Council within any time specified by the City
Council or Community Development Department but not to exceed

include any recommendations for changes to the preliminary
design or land acquisition that will lessen or alleviate any adverse
effect of the proposed project upon the historic or architectural
character of the Landmark or Historic District.
A. The City of Excelsior Springs and the Excelsior Springs Historic
Preservation Commission have adopted the following design review
guidelines for all Historic Districts and Landmarks in the City. The
guidelines are based on the "Secretary of the Interior's Standards and
Guidelines for Rehabilitation". The guidelines will be enforced within
District or Landmark boundaries under any of the following
circumstances:
1. Construction, alteration or removal requiring a building permit,
and which has an impact on the exterior appearance of a structure.
2. Demolition in whole or in part requiring a permit.
3. Construction, alteration (including color changes), demolition or
removal affecting a significant exterior architectural feature or
features.
4. Construction, alteration, improvement (including color changes),
demolition or removal which negatively impacts the significance,
appearance, or harmony of adjacent structures, rows of building,
streetscapes, or the Historic District as a whole as determined by
the ESHP Commission.
118. Note — Ord. no. 2010-10-2-2, adopted February 16, 2010, adopted additional design
guidelines for the Hall of Waters Historic District, which are on file in the city offices, and
were adopted and approved for use in administering ch. 402 including the issuance or
denial of certificate of appropriateness as required under section 402.140.
Section
402.180
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
402.190
I Notes:555
The purpose of the guidelines is to encourage preservation
of intact significant structures; restoration of significant
structures that have already undergone insensitive alterations;
and new construction that is sensitive to the existing
environment.
The guidelines are not intended to inhibit change, new
construction, or new architectural styles, as long as such
changes complement the existing buildings and streetscapes.
Design review decisions for all structures within a district and
all individual Landmarks will be based on the same set of
guidelines. However, structures possessing a greater degree
of integrity, originality, craftsmanship and historic significance,
may have the guidelines more stringently applied than those
with lesser significance, as determined by the Historic
Preservation Commission.
B. New Buildings And Additions To Existing Buildings. New buildings do
not need to duplicate older styles of architecture but must be
compatible with the architecture within the district. However, their
scale, placement on lots, and street setback must conform with the
scale, placement and setback of adjacent structures, especially in the
context of rows of buildings and streetscapes. Styles of architecture will
be controlled only to insure that their exterior design, materials, and
color are in harmony with neighboring structures.
C. Alterations. Alterations affecting the exterior of a structure shall
preserve all significant original exterior elements including building
materials, doors, windows, and decorative elements. In some cases,
exterior elements which are not original, but which have acquired
significance by virtue of their age or craftsmanship shall also be
preserved. Alterations shall restore a structure's original elements,
materials, and appearance if economically or physically feasible.
Alterations which disguise or sheath original elements and materials
will not be permitted.
Storefronts and commercial building facades shall be treated as a
whole. The first (1st) floor facade should be compatible with the upper
floor(s).
D. Demolition. Demolition in whole or in part, of individual Landmarks or
any structure within a Historic District, is not permitted. Exceptions are
allowed only if a structure has been substantially damaged through fire
or deterioration, and if there is reasonable proof that it would be not
economically or physically feasible to rehabilitate. Other exceptions
may be allowed if a structure does not possess the integrity, originality,
craftsmanship, and age to merit preservation.
Demolition of past additions which have disguised or sheathed original
elements or facades are encouraged, as long as the intention is to
restore such elements or facades.
Section
402.190
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
402.190
I Notes:556
E. Relocation Of Buildings. Structures shall not be removed from their
original site. Exceptions will be allowed only if there is substantial
evidence that it would not be practical or economical to utilize the
building on its present site.
If a building lies in the path of a public improvement project, involving
the City of Excelsior Springs, and if the building is worthy of
preservation by virtue of its integrity, originality, craftsmanship or age,
relocation may be considered as an alternative.
F. Exterior Walls. A structure's original walls, including masonry, siding,
sheathing materials, and exposed foundations shall be maintained and
preserved. Walls, siding, and sheathing materials which may not be
original, but which have acquired significance by virtue of age of
craftsmanship shall also be maintained and preserved. Such walls,
siding, and sheathing materials shall not be altered, covered or
disguised by new building materials, siding, stucco or paint.
Restoration of original wall, siding, and sheathing materials is
encouraged. Removal of false facades which cover or disguise original
walls and materials is encouraged.
If walls, siding and sheathing are to be painted, the colors chosen shall
harmonize with neighboring structures. The use of colors chosen from
a palette of colors popular at the time of construction of the building is
encouraged.
G. Decorative And Character Defining Elements. Original decorative and
character defining elements and decorative elements which may not be
original, but which have acquired significance by virtue of their historic
significance or craftsmanship, shall be restored, maintained, and
preserved. Such elements include, but are not limited to, moldings,
trimwork, cornices, brackets, posts, columns, towers, steeples, finials,
porches, porticos, verandas, parapet walls, bay windows, oriel
windows, patterned siding, decorative window sashes, architraves,
door surrounds, balustrades, dormers, roof overhangs, soffits, and
other significant elements which define the character, period and style
of a building.
Colors applied to these elements shall harmonize with adjacent or
neighboring structures. The use of colors chosen from a palette of
colors popular at the time of construction of the building is encouraged.
H. Doors And Windows. Original doors and windows shall not be replaced
unless there is substantial evidence that they are no longer serviceable
or cannot be restored. If it is necessary to expand openings, it shall be
accomplished in a manner which respects and complements the
surrounding building elements, materials, and colors. In general,
existing openings shall not be covered or relocated. If additional
entryways or service doors become necessary they shall be located and
designed in a sensitive manner. Restoration of original entryways,
which may have been covered, altered, or removed over time is

Section 402.200. Standards for Review. [R.O. 2012 §402.200; Ord.
No. 90-4-4 §1, 4-16-1989]
encouraged. Replacement doors and windows which imitate earlier
inappropriate styles is discouraged.
I. Porches. Porches, Porticos, Stoops, Entryways, Loading Docks, and
Exterior Stairways: Such elements shall be of scale, design, material,
and color which complement the existing facade and its individual
elements. Loading docks and other service entrances shall be located
inconspicuously, and should be considered a part of a building's overall
design scheme.
J. Roofs. Roof lines and shapes shall not be altered. Visible roofing
materials shall be compatible with other building elements and
materials in terms of colors, materials, texture. The use of roofing
materials appropriate to the style and period of the building is
encouraged. The use of roofing materials which reflect an earlier or
later style or period is discouraged.
K. Mechanical Equipment And Weather Protection Devices. Mechanical
and weather protection devices shall be placed and installed in a
manner which is unobtrusive.
L. Fences, Sidewalks, Decorative Dividers, And Walls. Fences and
decorative walls shall be placed and scaled in a manner which does not
cover, block or damage significant building facades or elements. Such
elements shall be of a style or period which corresponds with the style
or period of the building or buildings which they serve. Original fences,
walls, and sidewalks or fences, walls and sidewalks, and trees which
have acquired significance by virtue of their age or craftsmanship shall
not be removed or destroyed and shall be maintained and preserved.
M. Vacant Lots, Alleys, And Parking Areas. Parking lots, driveways, and
other spaces between and around buildings shall be designed and
maintained in a manner which does not detract from neighboring
buildings and facades. Garbage dumpsters, bollards, loading docks, and
other similar fixtures shall be structurally and cosmetically maintained
and shall be placed in a manner which is as inconspicuous as possible.
N. Sign Applications. Application for sign permits in or immediately
adjacent to a Landmark or Historic District are reviewed under the
existing procedures of the sign ordinance administered by the Zoning
Administrator. The Historic Preservation Commission may make
recommendations to the Zoning Administrator concerning the
conformance of a sign with the character of a Landmark or Historic
District.
A. In considering an application for a building or demolition permit or for a
Certificate of Appropriateness, the Building Inspector shall be guided
Section
402.190
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
402.200
I Notes:558
by the following general standards in addition to the design review
guidelines.
1. Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
2. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historical material or distinctive
architectural feature should be avoided when possible.
3. All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
4. Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
5. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
6. Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the materials being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be
based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
7. The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials should not be
undertaken.
8. Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
9. Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties and for new construction shall not be discouraged when
such alterations, additions, or new construction does not destroy
significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
deign is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and
character of the property, neighborhood or environment.

403.100
I Notes:574
act of God or other causes, each billboard shall have
minimum setbacks of the following:
(a) At least ninety (90) feet from the nearest edge to the
right-of-way of any Federal or State designated routes;
and
(b) At least ninety (90) feet from all property lines and
from all roofed structures, from all points of the
billboard.
(2) In order to further provide a safety zone to prevent injury
or property damage from collapse of a billboard caused by
an act of God or other causes, each billboard shall have a
maximum height, measured from the ground to the bottom
of the sign face of such structure, of thirty-five (35) feet. In
addition, the applicant for permit shall present
documentation to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Building Official that the applicant has secured the legally
enforceable right to prevent the erection of other
structures within the setback zones. No City building
permit shall be issued for construction of any building
within the setback/clearance zone for any billboard.
(3) No billboard shall be located adjacent to or within five
hundred (500) feet of any bridge approach or intersection

lighting and fencing around the proposed billboard to ensure
that the structure will be aesthetically compatible with its
surroundings and aesthetic standards of the community and
neighboring property, insofar as may be practicable, as well as
safe and secure from trespassers or vandals. Such plans shall
be reviewed and approved by the Building Official and Director
of Planning and Zoning. In determining whether the
landscaping plan is reasonably suitable, the Director shall take
Section
403.100
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
403.100
I Notes:575
into consideration the nature of the location, the impact on the
surrounding properties, the safety and security of the proposed
structure, and the relative cost of the landscaping, lighting and
fencing to the applicant in relationship to the overall impact
upon the property values in the immediate area which would
be caused by a lack of such landscaping, lighting and fencing
for the proposed structure.
f. Nuisances. Any billboard which, because of lack of
maintenance, upkeep, vandalism, accumulations of litter,
refuse or debris, or the deterioration of landscaping, light, or
fencing, becomes unsightly or unsafe is hereby declared to be
a nuisance and shall be subject to abatement by the City in the
same manner as all other nuisances on private property.
g. Service drives. Direct access to a billboard from curb cuts
along a State highway, Federal highway, or service road shall
be prohibited. Direct access shall be gained through paved
roads and drives which are private and internal to a lot or
parcel. All vehicles, equipment, and people used to build,
service, maintain and repair such signs must confine their
activity so as not to interfere with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic on public roads.
h. Legal non-conforming billboards. Any billboard which was
lawfully erected or affixed prior to the adoption of the
ordinance from which this Chapter is derived and which
complied with all regulations in force at the time it was erected
or affixed, but which fails to conform to all applicable
regulations and restrictions of this Chapter, shall be
considered a legal non-conforming billboard. A legal nonconforming
billboard may be continued and shall be
maintained in good condition, but shall not be:
(1) Structurally altered so as to prolong the life of the sign;
(2) Altered so as to increase the degree of non-conformity of
the sign;
(3) Expanded; or
(4) Re-established after damage or destruction if the
estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the appraised replacement costs at the time that
such damage occurred.
i. Abandoned billboards. Where a billboard structure does not
include advertising information other than for the use of the
billboard for a period of one hundred eighty (180) continuous
days, such billboard structure shall be deemed abandoned and
shall be removed.

No. 88-5-5, 5-16-1988]
Any building or structure for which a building permit has been issued by
the City of Excelsior Springs may be constructed according to the terms
of said permit. In addition, during a period of ninety (90) days following
the adoption of this ordinance a permit may be issued for any building
or structure for which plans were substantially complete on the date of
the adoption of this ordinance provided the Building Official, in his/her
judgment, is convinced that the plans were indeed prepared in good faith
and that substantial and undue hardship would prevail if the construction
were not allowed to proceed. Such building, structure or site conditions
may not conform in all respects with this Chapter but shall conform to the
previous zoning ordinances and the codes of the City of Excelsior Springs.
This period of transition may terminate ninety (90) days following the date
of the adoption of this ordinance and thereafter all permits for construction
shall require full conformance with this Chapter. In all cases of such noncompliance
during this period of transition, construction shall begin within
one hundred (100) days of the adoption of this ordinance or full compliance

Section 404.080. Board of Zoning Adjustment.119 [R.O. 2012
§404.090; Ord. No. 88-5-5, 5-16-1988; Ord. No. 02-9-5, 9-16-2002;
Ord. No. 14-07-05 §18, 7-21-2014]
A. Purpose. The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant variances from the
provisions of this Chapter in harmony with its general purpose and
intent and may vary them only in specific instances hereinafter set
forth. The Board of Zoning Adjustment, based on standards hereafter
prescribed and after hearing, may decide that these are practical
difficulties or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of these regulations. The concurring vote of four (4) members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement or
decision of the party appealed from or to issue an order or variance or
to decide in favor of an appellant.
B. Standards.
1. The Board of Adjustment may vary the provisions of this Chapter as
authorized in this Section, but only when it shall have made
findings based upon evidence presented to it in the following
specific cases:
a. That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return
if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by
the regulations governing the district in which it is located;
b. That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
119. Editor's Note: Ord. no. 08-9-2 has established terms for this board of zoning adjustment to
be uniform with the terms of other boards and commissions with terms commencing
September 30, 2009.
Section
404.070
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
404.080
I Notes:584
c. That the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
2. For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Board
of Adjustment shall also, in making a determination of whether
there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into
consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to
the applicant, have been established by the evidence:
a. That the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved
would bring a particular hardship upon the owner, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of
the regulation were to be carried out;
b. That the conditions upon which the petition for variance is
based would not be applicable generally to other property
within the same zoning classification;
c. That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any person having an interest in the property at any time after
the effective date of this ordinance;
d. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare in the neighborhood in which the property is
located;
e. That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply
of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase
the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
3. The Board of Adjustment may require such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises to be benefitted by a variance as
may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this
Section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variance
upon other property in the neighborhood and to implement the
general purpose and intent of this Chapter. Failure to maintain
such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall
constitute grounds for revocation of such variance.
C. Procedure. A variance shall be decided by the Board of Adjustment only
after a hearing before the Board of Adjustment and in compliance with
other requirements of applicable Statutes of the State of Missouri.
D. Appeals. An appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any
person, firm, or corporation from any decision of the City, including the
Building Official, made under this Chapter. Filing of the appeal shall be
accompanied by a fee as specified in the Schedule of Fees, Title I,
Appendix A.

The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing
on the plan as provided by law. At such time as the
development as planned meets with the approval of the
Commission, the same shall be duly approved, properly
endorsed and identified and sent onto the Council for
action. Upon final approval of the plan and the
rezoning of the tract, construction may proceed and

approved as to compliance with the development plan
prior to the issuance of a building permit.
The final plans submitted shall include a landscape and

record thereof. All such applications shall be set down for hearing

recommend such conditions as in its judgment are necessary. In
adopting any ordinance approving any rezoning, the City Council
may enumerate such conditions which in its judgment are
necessary to mitigate the effects of the proposed development.
6. Proof of ownership or option contract to buy. Applicant shall furnish
proof that he/she is the owner or has an option or contract to buy

such application, the Planning Commission shall approve or deny
the same, at the earliest reasonable time, and shall transmit an
accurate written summary of the proceedings to the City Clerk.
7. Submission of Planning Commission action to Council. Following
the receipt of the summary of the action of the Planning
Commission, the City Clerk shall submit the same to the City
Council for action approving or disapproving the recommendation
for the Planning Commission, provided however, the Council may
for good cause continue its action upon such application or take the
same under advisement for final decision at a later date, and in any
case the record shall show the reason for such continuance or
withholding of action.
8. Continuances — action required of applicant. Upon request of the
applicant to the Building Official, one (1) continuance of the

least restrictive is District "M-2".
10. Equal or more restrictive change. The Planning Commission may
recommend and the City Council may adopt a change in zoning
which is equal to or more restrictive than the one requested,
provided the more restrictive district is the same "R", "C", or "M"
category for which the change was requested. In no case may a
change to an "R" District be approved if the application is for a "C"
or "M" District, and in no case may a "C" District be approved if the
application is for an "M" District. A Planned District shall be equally
restrictive to its equivalent district. Provided further, the Council
may, if in its judgment deemed advisable for the interest of the
public and applicant, refer such application back to the Planning
Commission for further consideration and public hearing. The
applicant shall not be required to pay an additional filing fee in
such rehearing proceedings.

amendment, revision, change or repeal of the zoning ordinance,
Zoning District Map, rules or regulations, may also be made by the
Planning Commission upon its own motion or by the City Council,
providing the same are first submitted to the Planning Commission
for hearing and recommendation. In either case, final action by the
City Council shall be taken only after hearing upon publication
notice and recommendation, whether favorable or otherwise, by
the Planning Commission, in the manner hereinbefore provided. In

amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal shall not
become effective except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (?) of

highway. Where lots will front or side, but do not back on railroad
right of way or limited access highways, a marginal access street or
frontage road may be required parallel and adjacent to said right of
way. The location and design of such access street shall be such
that safe and convenient traffic movements at intersections are
maintained.
9. Half streets. Half streets shall be avoided except where they are
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in
conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or

91-4-3 §§1 — 3, 4-1-1991]
A. Variances. Any person seeking a variance from the strict application of
these regulations or who is aggrieved by a decision of any official in the
application of these subdivision regulations may make such request or
appeal such decision to the Board of Zoning Adjustment ("BZA"). The
concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement or decision of the party appealed from
or to issue an order or variance or to decide in favor of an appellant.
Whenever the "BZA" deems full conformance to one (1) or more
provisions of these regulations is impractical or impossible due to the
size, shape, topographic location or other condition that is beyond the
control of the subdivider, the Board may grant one (1) or more
variances from these regulations at the time the preliminary or final
plat is acted upon. Such variance shall assure that substantial justice is
done, and the long term public interest is secured as opposed to the
mere granting of a privilege. In recommending such variances, the
"BZA" shall first make these findings:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property which are not typical of other properties in the City.
2. That the variance is necessary for the reasonable and acceptable
development of the property.
3. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity.
B. No variance shall be granted which would have the effect of amending a
final plat which has been recorded.
C. A variance or appeal shall be decided by the "BZA" only after hearing
before the "BZA". Filing of the request shall be accompanied by a fee of
seventy-five dollars ($75.00), copies of any covenants or deed
restrictions pertaining to subject property, a list of neighboring
property owners within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of site
property line and an eleven (11) inch by seventeen (17) inch site plan
copy drawn to scale.
A. Permits — Unplatted Lands. After the date of the adoption of these rules
and regulations by the Planning Commission and City Council, no
building permit shall be issued for any structure that is located upon a
lot required to be subdivided by these regulations unless said lot is in
compliance with all of these regulations and any other applicable
ordinance of Excelsior Springs.
B. Penalty. Any person violating the provisions of the subdivision
regulations is guilty of an ordinance violation and upon conviction
thereof shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by confinement in the

Performance Criteria for Stormwater Management
Section 407.140. Performance Criteria for Stormwater
Management. [Ord. No. 14-04-09 §1, 4-21-2014]
For land development that results in land disturbance less than one (1)
acre, no stormwater detention/retention or permanent stormwater quality
treatment best management practices are required. For all other land
development, the following criteria must be met.
Section 407.150. General Stormwater Management Criteria. [Ord.
No. 14-04-09 §1, 4-21-2014]
A. Compliance With Federal And State Regulations. All stormwater
facilities and conveyance systems shall be designed in compliance with
all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including the
Federal Clean Water Act and all applicable erosion and sediment
control, wetland and flood plain regulations.
B. Protect Public Health, Safety And General Welfare. The design of
stormwater BMPs shall consider public health, safety, and general
welfare. These considerations include, but are not limited to:
preventing the flooding of structures; safe passage of vehicles on
roadways; preventing standing water in facilities, manholes, inlets, and
other structures in a manner that promotes breeding of mosquitoes;
preventing attractive nuisance conditions and dangerous conditions
due to velocity or depth of water and/or access to orifices and drops;
and preventing aesthetic nuisances due to excessive slopes, cuts and
fills, and other conditions.
C. Adherence To KC-APWA 5100, KC-APWA 5600 And MARC BMP Manual.
All stormwater facilities and BMPs shall be designed to the standards of
the KC-APWA 5100, KC-APWA 5600 and MARC BMP Manual, unless a
variance is granted or the applicant is exempt from such requirements.
D. Stormwater Authority Discretion. If hydrologic, geologic, topographic,
or land use conditions warrant greater control than that provided by
the minimum control requirements, the Director may impose additional
requirements prior to the approval of the stormwater management
plans, as deemed reasonable and necessary to control the volume,
timing, rate and/or quality of runoff. The Director may restrict the use
of certain stormwater BMPs, require additional pretreatment, and/or
require a post-construction stormwater pollution prevention plan in
certain circumstances. These include, but are not limited to:
stormwater generated from stormwater hotspots, stormwater
discharges that are conveyed with non-stormwater discharges, or areas
where geologic conditions are conducive to groundwater
contamination.

407.140
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
407.150
I Notes:631
Section 407.160. Engineered Systems. [Ord. No. 14-04-09 §1,
4-21-2014]
E. Hydrologic Computation Assumptions. Hydrologic parameters shall
reflect the ultimate land development and shall be used in all
engineering calculations. All pre-development calculations shall
consider woods and fields to be in good condition, regardless of actual
conditions at the time of application.
F. Location Of Stormwater Facilities On Lots. Stormwater facilities within
residential subdivisions that serve multiple lots and/or a combination of
lots and roadways shall be on a lot owned and maintained by an entity
of common ownership, unless an alternative arrangement is approved
by the Director. Stormwater practices located on individual lots shall be
placed within an easement and either maintained by the lot owner or
maintained by an entity of common ownership.
A. Replicating Pre-Development Hydrology. Stormwater management
designs shall preserve the natural hydrologic functions, stream channel
characteristics, and groundwater recharge of the pre-developed
condition to the maximum extent practicable. This shall be
accomplished by treating runoff at the source, disconnecting
impervious surfaces, preserving or enhancing natural flow paths and
vegetative cover, preserving or enhancing natural open spaces and
riparian areas, and other measures that replicate pre-development
hydrologic conditions. The Director shall exercise discretion in the
application of this standard, especially in cases of infill development,
redevelopment, or other unique circumstances. Capture and treatment
of the Water Quality Volume per the MARC BMP Manual shall be
considered the acceptable standard of meeting this requirement.
B. Velocity Dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations of the stormwater conveyance system and along the
length of any outfall to provide non-erosive flow velocity from the
structure to an adequate receiving stream or channel so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the
receiving stream are maintained and protected.
C. Discharges To Adjacent Property. Concentrated discharges from the
stormwater conveyance system or stormwater best management
practices shall not be discharged onto adjacent property without
adequate conveyance in a natural stream or storm sewer system.
Drainage easements are required where stormwater discharges must
cross an adjacent or off-site property before reaching an adequate
conveyance.
D. Flow Toward Streets. In order to have sufficient traffic safety, any
concentration of surface flow in excess of two (2) cubic feet per second
(cfs) for the ten-year frequency rain shall be intercepted before
reaching the street right-of-way and shall be carried by a storm drain to

14-04-09 §1, 4-21-2014]
connect with a drainage structure at the low point in the street right-ofway
or to discharge to a watercourse.
E. Drainage Onto Sidewalks. Tributary areas where sidewalks exist or are
proposed, and which drain across a public sidewalk, must not exceed
three thousand (3,000) square feet of impervious area, including roofs
discharging upon paved areas, or nine thousand (9,000) square feet of
sodded areas, or in proportional amounts for a combination of such
areas. Paved, roofed or other impervious areas exceeding three
thousand (3,000) square feet shall be provided with drains for
discharge into storm conduits, channels or street gutters.
F. Downspouts. Downspouts shall not be discharged directly onto
sidewalks or entrance ways. When downspouts are connected to the
gutterline of the street or the public drainage system, they shall be
connected by a method approved by the City. Downspouts shall not
discharge within the building setback unless there is a drainage swale
established to carry the water to the front or rear of the property or
closest natural drainage course. Downspouts may also discharge within
the building setback if discharging into a rain garden, rain barrel or
other stormwater best management practice.
G. Existing Storm Drains. No cuts shall be made nor fill deposited over
existing storm drains nor shall existing storm drains be altered without
the approval of the Department of Public Works.
A. Stream Preservation And Buffer Zones/Building Setbacks. All streams
having a tributary area in excess of 40 acres shall be preserved
according to the standards set forth in KC-APWA 5600. This shall be
accomplished by establishing stream buffer zones to reduce the
encroachment of development on these natural systems and provide
filtration and infiltration of runoff prior to discharge. Buildings shall be
set back from the outer edge of the stream buffer at least an additional
ten (10) feet. Adjustments in widths of the buffer zone or adjacent
building setback may be made when approved by the Public Works
Director when local conditions justify deviation from the standard
widths.
B. Plans. Stream buffers shall be delineated on all surveys, plats and
development plans. Any plans that require construction within the
stream buffer as allowed by this Chapter, shall provide stream
assessment and other calculations as needed to show compliance with
the standards set forth in KC-APWA 5600.
C. Stream Buffer Function. The function of the streamside zone is to
protect the physical, biological and ecological integrity of the stream
ecosystem. The vegetative target for the stream buffer is undisturbed
indigenous vegetation. Wherever the designated buffer zone must be
Section
407.160
NOTES AND APPENDICES Section
407.170
I Notes:633
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be taken to re-establish vegetative
filtration and stream stabilization to the maximum extent practicable.
D. Adjoining Wetlands. The buffer width will begin and be measured from
the ordinary high water mark. Wetlands that adjoin the buffer shall be
added to the buffer. There shall be a fifteen (15) foot buffer around any
edge of the wetland that is not within the stream buffer.
E. Allowable Uses In The Stream Buffer.
1. Flood control structures, stream gauging and water quality
monitoring equipment, stormwater treatment facilities in
accordance with an approved plan.
2. Utility crossings.
3. Permeable surfaced foot and bicycle paths.
4. Road crossings.
5. Utilities where no practical alternatives exist as determined by the
Director.
6. Stream restoration, stream bank restoration or restoration of
indigenous vegetation in accordance with an approved plan.
7. Roads, that exist on or before the date of adoption of these
regulations, and associated maintenance activities.
F. Restricted Uses In The Stream Buffer. The following uses are prohibited
except where incidental to an allowable use:
1. Clearing of existing vegetation.
2. Grading, stripping or other soil-disturbing practices.
3. Filling or dumping.
4. Draining the buffer area by ditching, underdrains or other systems.
5. Use, storage or application of pesticides, except for the spot
spraying of noxious weeds or other species consistent with
recommendations of the Missouri Department of Conservation,
Clay County Soil and Water Conservation District, United States
Department of Agriculture or University of Missouri Extension
Service.
6. Storage or operation of motorized vehicles except for maintenance
or emergency use.
7. Walls, solid fences, chain link fences, woven or welded wire fences.
8. Structures or any type of impervious surface except as provided
above.
Section
407.170
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.170
I Notes:634
G. Stream Buffer Management And Maintenance.
1. Management, responsible party. The stream buffer, including
wetlands and floodplains, shall be managed by the landowner to
enhance and maximize the unique value of these resources.
Management includes specific limitations on alteration of the
natural conditions of the land and vegetation.
2. Allowed maintenance practices and activities in the buffer. All
allowed uses may be maintained subject to the review of the City.
Any entity conducting an allowed activity within the streamside
zone shall restore any disturbed area to its previous condition or in
accordance with a plan approved by the Director. In addition to
maintenance of allowed uses, the following maintenance activities
may be conducted:
a. Roads, bridges, paths, and utilities existing as of the date of
adoption of these regulations.
b. Rights-of-way for roads and utilities should be the minimum
width to allow for installation, access and maintenance.
c. Removal of diseased or dead trees, brush and trash.
d. Maintenance of all City-approved improvements, including
utilities.
e. Removal of debris which could cause flooding.
f. Selective (spot) spraying of noxious or other vegetation.
3. Restricted maintenance practices and activities within the stream
buffer:
a. Clearing of existing vegetation.
b. Soil disturbance by grading, stripping, or other practices.
c. Filling or dumping.
d. Drainage by ditching, under drains or other systems.
e. Use, storage, or application of pesticides.
f. Storage or operation of motorized vehicles, except for
maintenance and emergency use approved by the City or when
operated on a legally established roadway.
H. Stream And Wetland Crossings. All stream and wetland crossings
subject to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or state stream and/
or wetland regulations shall minimize impacts on streams and
wetlands, to the extent practical and achievable, by crossing streams
and wetlands at a right-angle, reducing the footprint of grading and fill,
matching the existing stream profile grade, and utilizing bridges, open

bottom arches, spans, or other structures that do not restrict or alter
stream or wetland hydrology. If culverts are placed within streams and/
or wetlands, at least one culvert shall be countersunk at least one (1)
foot below the natural channel flowline (or 10% of the pipe diameter) to
allow movement of aquatic organisms. As much as possible, the natural
multi-stage channel shape shall be mimicked.
A. Water Quality Protection. In order to protect the receiving waters from
nonpoint source pollution, the water quality volume shall be captured
and treated to the level of service prescribed by the MARC BMP
Manual.
B. Channel Protection Criteria. The stormwater system shall be designed
so that post-development discharges will not erode natural channels or
steep slopes. This will protect in-stream habitats and reduce in-channel
erosion. Channel protection shall be provided by controlling the postdevelopment
peak discharge rate of the 2-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event to the pre-development rate.
C. Flood Control Criteria. Downstream overbank flood and property
protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak
discharge rate to the pre-development rate. This criterion shall be met
for the 10-year, twenty-four-hour storm event on residentially zoned
properties and the 25-year, twenty-four-hour storm event on nonresidentially
zoned properties. Stormwater BMPs that impound water
shall demonstrate that the 100-year storm can safely pass through the
structure without overtopping or creating damaging conditions
downstream.
D. Overland Flood Routes. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year storm event to an
adequate receiving water resource or stormwater BMP such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing
path and does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The
peak 100-year water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall
be at least one (one) foot below the finished grade elevation at the
structure. When designing the flood routing paths, the conveyance
capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into consideration.
A. Treat Entire Land Development. The stormwater design shall provide
for treatment of runoff from the water quality rainfall event to the
maximum extent practicable through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMP to the Level of Service required by the MARC BMP
Manual.
Section
407.170
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.190
I Notes:636
B. Landscape Plan. The design of vegetative stormwater BMPs shall
include a landscape plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the
practice and how and who will manage and maintain the vegetation.
C. Pretreatment. Each stormwater BMP shall have an acceptable form of
water quality pretreatment if required to provide adequate long term
operation and maintenance of the BMP.
D. Treatment Of Off-Site Stormwater. Off-site stormwater conveyed
through a land development shall be placed within an easement and
conveyed in a manner that does not increase upstream or downstream
flooding. Off-site stormwater shall be conveyed around on-site
stormwater BMPs, unless the facilities are designed to manage the offsite
stormwater. The Director may allow the treatment of off-site
stormwater in lieu of up to ten percent (10%) of the site's water quality
volume.
E. Wetland Protection. Wetlands meeting the Army Corps of Engineers
definition of a jurisdictional wetland must be protected in all
watersheds. Protection methods for wetlands include:
1. Appropriate setbacks that preserve the wetlands or wetland
functions;
2. Wetland mitigation, including wetland replacement;
3. Wetland restoration or enhancement.
F. The Director may approve the removal and replacement of a wetland as
approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the elimination of
setbacks from a constructed wetland that is primary use is for water
quality control.

A. Purpose. This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted in
64.907, 64.825 — 64.885, Revised Statutes of Missouri and are
intended to regulate non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage
system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and
state law. This Chapter establishes methods for controlling the
introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer
system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The
objectives of this Chapter are:
1. To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user.
2. To prohibit Illicit Connections and Discharges to the MS4.
3. To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with
this Chapter.
B. Applicability. This Chapter shall apply to all water entering the storm
drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands
unless explicitly exempted.
C. Ultimate Responsibility. The standards set forth in this article and
promulgated pursuant to this article are minimum standards.
Compliance with this article does not insure that there will be no
contamination, pollution or unauthorized discharge of pollutants into
the waters of the United States. This article shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any agent or employee of the City for any
damages that result from any discharges, reliance on this article or any
administrative decision made under this article.
D. Stormwater Pollution Prevention. Any owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own
expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or
may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this Section. These

any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this Chapter,
shall upon conviction be fined not more than five hundred dollars
($500.00) and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved
in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City
of Excelsior Springs, Missouri, or other appropriate authority, from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. Where a violation is declared a nuisance, all
policies and procedures set forth in Chapter 235 of the City Code
shall apply.
A. General. Where undue hardships or practical difficulties may result
from strict compliance with this Chapter, the developer may file an
application for a variance. Said applications shall be directed to the City
of Excelsior Springs Board of Zoning Adjustment organized and existing
under the zoning regulations of The City of Excelsior Springs, Missouri,
which shall have the jurisdiction and shall be charged with the duty of
hearing and deciding applications for variances from the strict
application of the provisions of this Chapter. The Board may grant a
variance only if it finds after public hearing and upon competent and
substantial evidence that the applicant meets the following criteria:
1. The variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of this stormwater ordinance.
2. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare, or injurious to other property or
improvements.
3. The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought, are not
applicable generally to other property, and are not self-imposed.
4. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if this Chapter was strictly interpreted
and carried out.
B. Conditions. In recommending variances and exceptions, staff may
recommend and the Board may require such conditions as will, in the
judgment of each, secure substantially the objectives of the standards
or requirements of this Chapter.
C. Application. An application for a variance shall be submitted at the time
of filing for a preliminary plat or for application for a building permit,
whenever possible. The application shall be on forms provided by the
City and shall state fully the grounds for the request and all facts relied

A. Jurisdiction. These regulations shall apply to all land located within the
City of Excelsior Springs.
B. Purpose And Intent. The /U Underground Overlay District is established
for the following purposes:
1. To accommodate and permit the reasonable use of underground
space;
2. To protect other properties and persons from adverse effects
caused by underground activities; and
3. To protect the health, safety and welfare of persons in or around /U
Districts.
A. The /U District may be established when either of the following
conditions exists:
1. Where usable underground space exists; or
2. Where subsurface located material intended to be extracted exists
that adjoins an existing /U District or where the surface land at the
entrance has an "A" Agriculture or "M" Industrial zoning
classification.
B. The /U zoning classification may be established, amended or removed
only in accordance with rezoning procedures of Chapter 400. The only
difference is that the /U District provisions apply only to the subsurface
area and do not affect the zoning classification of the land surface above
the /U District.
C. The initial designation or amendment must be accompanied by a
certified survey map showing the extent of existing underground
mining, the extent of proposed underground mining, and all points of
access to the surface, whether vehicle entrances, pedestrian entrances,
or openings for utility or ventilation.
A. The following uses are permitted by right in the /U Underground
Overlay District:

§408.040; Ord. No. 12-03-04, 3-5-2012]
1. Any use permitted by right, permitted by right with minimum use
standards, or by special use permit in the zoning district controlling
the surface property at the primary entrance (that having the most
traffic) to the underground space is permitted in the /U District.
2. When not allowed by the surface zoning classification, extraction
may be allowed by special use permit in accordance with Section
400.230.
3. Other allowed uses may be allowed in the subject /U District by the
City Council at the time the /U District is established, provided that
such use is not otherwise prohibited by other relevant City
ordinance.
A. Underground space in the /U District is subject to the following
standards and requirements:
1. Building permits are required to develop a habitable underground
building and to qualify for a certificate of occupancy.
2. Access to underground uses must be by means only of nonresidential
zoning districts. Access to underground uses must be
through property owned by or controlled by operators of the
underground space. Such access must connect immediately to a
major thoroughfare without first proceeding through or by other
properties; or such entrances must be on property properly zoned
to contain the uses developed within the underground space.
3. In order to qualify for building permits or certificates of occupancy,
the owners or operators of underground space must have on file
with the City a certificate by a registered professional engineer
regarding the structural integrity of the underground space. Such
certificate may provide for exceptions or conditions that apply as a
condition of building permit approval.
4. All above ground ventilation equipment and utility installations
must be screened from view of streets and adjacent R-zoned lots by
landscaping or structures that are architecturally compatible with
surrounding development.

The City Council may impose conditions of approval as it deems
appropriate to the particulars of the request. Approval of a
special use is at the sole discretion of the City Council and
is not a use of right. Such approval, when given, shall be
solely for the location proposed, and shall not be transferable
voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law; but shall
be personal to the permittee to whom such special use permit
is granted. The City Council may revoke a special use permit
for cause shown, after a hearing. Failure to meet minimum
requirements of the law or conditions of the special use permit
shall be grounds for revocation.
A. The intent of this Chapter is to ensure the provision of quality
communications services within the City limits; establish a fair and
efficient process for the review and approval of communication facility
applications; assure an integrated, comprehensive review of impacts of
such facilities, and protect the health, safety, welfare and aesthetic
character of the community. The City of Excelsior Springs recognizes
that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be
an economic development asset to the City and a benefit to residents.
This Chapter is intended to ensure that the placement, construction,
and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities complies
with all applicable Federal laws and is consistent with the City's land
use policies, zoning, planning, and design standards. This Chapter is
intended to meet the following specific objectives:
1. Ensure access to reliable wireless communications services
throughout the City;
2. Encourage the use of existing monopoles, towers, utility poles and
other structures for the co-location of telecommunications
facilities;
3. Encourage siting of telecommunication facilities on public lands;
4. Minimize the total number of towers throughout the City;
5. Ensure the use of disguised (stealth) facilities in residential areas,
properties located in corridors with specific design guidelines, and
properties located near historically significant structures or
districts;

example: water tanks, towers, utility poles, building rooftops, etc.) without
the need to construct a new support structure.
DISGUISED (STEALTH) TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY — Any
telecommunications facility that is integrated as an architectural feature of
a structure so that the purpose of the facility for providing wireless services
is not readily apparent to a casual observer. All antennae, arrays, cables and
other equipment used for providing communications service shall not be
obtrusive or noticeably visible from adjacent properties or adjacent streets.
Examples of disguised telecommunications facilities include, but are not
limited to, structures designed to resemble trees, flagpoles, steeples,
crosses, clock towers or other building elements.
MONOPOLE — A single, freestanding pole-type structure supporting one
(1) or more antenna.
REPLACEMENT — Replacement of an existing structure, antenna or tower
that exists on a previously approved site, utility easement, or approved
special use permit area as long as the new tower is no greater than an
additional twenty percent (20%) of the height of the original tower.
6. Encourage the location of new monopoles in non-residential areas
and in areas where adverse impact on the community will be
minimal;
7. Avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and
telecommunications facilities by ensuring that such structures are
soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, and
maintained.

otherwise stated herein, support structures shall be set back from
all platted property lines a distance equal to the height of the
structure measured from the base of the structure to its highest
point (excluding lightning arrestor). Setbacks for other structures
shall be governed by the underlying zoning district.
3. Safety fall zones: For towers in, or adjacent to, residential zones or
uses, a safety fall zone equal to the height of the tower measured
from the base of the structure to its highest point (excluding
lightning arrestor) shall be provided separating the proposed tower
from any residential structure, excluding accessory structures.
Exceptions: The Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend, and the City Council may approve, a deviation from
the setback and fall zone requirements if it finds that all of the
following conditions are met:
a. The deviation will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent
property owners or residents.
b. That the strict application of the provisions of this Chapter
would constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property
owner represented in this application.
c. That the deviation will not adversely affect the public health,
safety or general welfare.

B. A copy of the 2012 International Property Maintenance Code is on file
and open for inspection of the public in the office of the City Clerk of the

A. Statement Of Intent.
1. The intent of the City Council in passing this Chapter is to provide a
means of protecting the health and safety of persons who occupy
residential dwelling units in Excelsior Springs. The inspection is
not designed to impose any undue hardship on the property owners
by causing them to make unnecessary and costly improvements to
their respective properties, but rather to provide safe and sanitary
Section
505.130
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
510.030
I Notes:706
dwelling units, particularly rental units, to future residents of our
community.
2. The inspection will not require that existing dwelling units be
brought up to present new construction Building Code standards,
rather the inspection will check for health and safety measures and
sanitation. Exterior areas will also be inspected to ensure that they
are reasonably clear of trash and debris. The inspections will check
for serious electrical, plumbing, and structural defects as well as
acceptable levels of sanitation. Minor problems, such as worn
carpet or floor covering or other minor non-health and safety items,
will not constitute a violation.
B. Occupancy Inspections.
1. Residential occupancy inspections will be conducted no less often
than every two (2) years upon vacancy. It is the responsibility of the
property owner to schedule inspections, unless exempt as provided
in Subsection (B)(2). An occupant can request an inspection at any
time. All residential inspections shall inspect for conformance to
minimum housing, building and sanitation standards, including but
not limited to interior and exterior conditions and grounds. The
inspection shall include, but not be limited to, the following general
guidelines:

schedule inspections of all units upon a change of ownership of the
property, or change of occupancy of an individual unit after any
dwelling/unit is vacated and prior to any new occupancy of the
vacated unit unless the individual unit has satisfactorily passed an
inspection within the previous twenty-four (24) months; but shall
schedule inspections of all units no less often than every two (2)
years unless exempt due to continuous occupancy as provided
herein. A property owner, landlord, agent, builder, developer, or
other party involved in the provision of rental housing units may
annually provide a certification of continuous occupancy for units
occupied by the same tenant and for which no inspection is being
requested. If the unit remains occupied by the same tenant, the

I Notes:868
2. Variable For Operation. The system shall be capable of operating
over an outdoor temperature range of minus twenty degrees
Fahrenheit (-20°F) to plus one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit
(120°F) and over variation in supply voltages from one hundred five
(105) to one hundred thirty (130) volts AC, without catastrophic
failure or irreversible performance changes.
3. Specifications. A cable television system shall have a minimum
capacity of three hundred (300) Mhz, and a minimum of thirty-four
(34) channels of entertainment and information. The system shall
be capable of meeting all specifications over an outdoor
temperature range of zero degrees Fahrenheit (0°F) to plus one
hundred degrees Fahrenheit (100°F) and over variation in supply
voltages from one hundred five (105) to one hundred thirty (130)
volts AC.

manner as to avoid causing interference with the reception of offthe-
air signals of a subscriber.
5. Picture And Sound Quality. A cable television system shall be
capable of producing a picture on each subscriber's television
screen in black and white or color, depending upon whether color is
being telecast and provided the subscriber's television set is
capable of producing a color picture, that is materially undistorted
and materially free from ghost images other than those resulting
from ingress which can normally be expected from off-the-air
signals, without material degradation of color fidelity. The system
shall produce sound that is materially undistorted on any properly
functioning receiver of a subscriber.
6. FCC Technical Standards. Should the FCC promulgate technical
standards which exceed the performance guidelines contained in
the Cable and Wireless Communications Code, an operator shall
operate its system so that it meets or exceeds FCC standards.
L. Equipment For Hearing-Impaired Persons. An operator of a cable
communications system shall inform subscribers, upon request, where
they may obtain equipment which facilitate the reception of cable
service by hearing-impaired individuals, where such properly encoded
programming exists. If that equipment is not available from other
sources, an operator shall make that equipment available for
subscribers for reasonable installation and rental charges.
M. Performance Standards.

system on an ongoing basis shall be at least as stringent as those in
other high-quality, reliable, communications systems of similar design.
A summary of all ongoing tests shall be provided by the operator for the
City's review, upon the City's request. When a subscriber has
complained to an operator directly, or through the City, about the
technical quality of the service received by the subscriber, and that
complaint remains unresolved for thirty (30) days, the City may request
the performance by the operator, at the operator's cost, of reasonable
tests in addition to those tests performed by the operator, at the
operator's cost, of reasonable tests in addition to those tests performed
by the operator as part of its ongoing testing program, to measure the
technical quality of the system in the area of the complaint. Tests
performed by the operator in an effort to resolve the subscriber
complaint need not be duplicated by the operator.
O. Emergencies.
1. Emergency Services. Subject to applicable law, an operator of a
cable communications system shall incorporate into its system the
capability to permit the City, in times of emergency, to override the
audio portion of all cable service channels simultaneously. The

ordinance. An operator may request a review of the revocation findings
and conclusions pursuant to any applicable law.

revocation findings and conclusions by a court of competent

2012 §710.010; Ord. No. 6438, 10-7-1974]
The City will not permit a street service connection until the customer's
service pipe is installed in accordance with existing plumbing codes and
City specifications. All service lines installed by the owner or his/her agent,
from the property line to the point of use, shall be inspected by the City
before such lines are covered. The main must be exposed at the tapping
point and copper service pipe must be installed to the center line of the
main before tap will be made by the City. The service trench shall not be
backfilled until after the tap is made. The tap excavation at the main must
be of sufficient size to allow the tapper to attach and operate the tapping
machine, and must be free from mud and water. At the time the tap is
made, the tapper will turn on the water and inspect the service line from the
tapping point to the meter yoke. If the tapper finds the tap not ready when
he/she calls, the City must be notified again of readiness for the tap to be
installed. The customer must make all changes in the service pipe from the
meter outlet, required on account of changes of grade, relocation of mains,
or other causes. Any change in the location of any existing service at the
request of the customer shall be made at the expense of the customer.
Section 710.020. Service Pipe. [R.O. 2012 §710.020; Ord. No. 6438,

All service pipe in the City between the main and property line shall be a
minimum of three-quarter (¾) inch, type "K" copper, and shall be laid to
provide a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches cover. All service pipes shall be
installed in a trench at least four (4) feet in a horizontal direction from any
other trench wherein are laid gas pipes, and ten (10) feet from any sewer
pipes or other facilities, public or private, unless otherwise specifically
authorized and approved by the City.
Copper service runs between the main and meter yoke will be of one piece
and no splices nor connections of any kind will be allowed in the service
line. The service line must be laid out to the main at right angles to the
face of the building at the point where the service line enters the face
of the building. The service line between the meter box and the front of
the building may be offset to pass the building in a line and as close to
the building as practicable. In case such a procedure does not allow the
service line to approach the main at right angels, special instructions must
be obtained from the Utilities Department by the plumber.
Customers will not be permitted to extend service lines along public or
private streets, or roadways, or through property of others in order to
obtain connection to a water main.
If the City is required to replace any existing street service connections with
larger pipe, the customer shall pay the entire cost of such replacement.

§2, 9-6-1988]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Article is:
1. To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by containing within the consumer's internal distribution
system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water supply system.
2. To promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public
or consumer's potable water system and non-potable water
systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial, process systems.
3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
B. Application. This Article shall apply to all premises served by the public
potable water system of the City of Excelsior Springs.
C. Policy. This Article will be reasonably interpreted by the Water
Purveyor. It is the Water Purveyor's intent to recognize the varying
degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of
protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
The Water Purveyor shall be primarily responsible for protection of
the public potable water distribution system from contamination of
pollution due to backflow or contaminants or pollutants through the
water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required
to implement and maintain the program to control cross-connections.
The Water Purveyor and consumer are jointly responsible for
preventing contamination of the water system.
If, in the judgement of the Water Purveyor or his/her authorized
representative, cross-connection protection is required through either
piping modification or installation of an approved backflow prevention
device, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall
immediately comply by providing the required protection at his/her own
expense; and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer
to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing
water service to the premises until such protection has been provided.

sufficiently short notice to assure the cross-connections do not
exist.
4. Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being
established or re-established.
5. Premises, which due to the nature of the enterprise therein, are
subject to recurring modification or expansion.
6. Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as
to permit entry into the public water supply, or where a crossconnection
could reasonably be expected to occur. This shall
include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.
7. Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are
handled such that if backsiphonage or backpressure should occur,
a serious health hazard may result.
C. The following types of facilities fall into one or more of the categories of
premises where an approved air-gap separation or reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device is required by the Water Purveyor
