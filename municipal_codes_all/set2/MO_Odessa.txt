City of Odessa, MO
Last Revision  June 25, 2012
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LIABILITY
2.300-1 VOLUNTARY ACT
A. A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act.
B. A "voluntary act" is:
1. A bodily movement performed while conscious as a result of effort or determination; or
2. An omission to perform an act of which the actor is physically capable.
C. Possession is a voluntary act if the possess or knowingly procures or receives the thing possessed, or having
acquired control of it was aware of his control for a sufficient time to have enabled him to dispose of it or terminate his
control.
D. A person is not guilty of an offense based solely upon an omission to perform an act unless the law defining the
offense expressly so provides, or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law. [R.S.Mo. 562.011]
2.300-2 CULPABLE MENTAL STATE
A. Except as provided in section 2.300-4, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acts with a culpable mental state,
that is, unless he acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly or with criminal negligence, as the section defining the
offense may require with respect to the conduct, the result thereof or the attendant circumstances which constitute the
material elements of the offense.
B. A person "acts purposely", or with purpose, with respect to his conduct or to a result thereof, when it is his conscious
object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.
C. A person "acts knowingly" or with knowledge:
1. With respect to his conduct or to attendant circumstances when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that
those circumstances exist; or
2. With respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is practically certain to cause that
result.
D. A person "acts recklessly" or is reckless when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
circumstances exist or that a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes gross deviation from the standard of
care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation.
E. A person "acts with criminal negligence" or is criminally negligent when he fails to be aware of a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a gross deviation from the
standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation. [R.S.Mo. 562.016]
2.300-3 CULPABLE MENTAL STATE, APPLICATION
1. If the definition of an offense prescribes a culpable mental state but does not specify the conduct, attendant
circumstances, or result to which it applies, the prescribed culpable mental state applies to each such material
element.
2. If the definition of an offense prescribes criminal negligence as the culpable mental state, it is also established if a
person acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it
is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish a culpable
mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely.
CHAPTER TWO
POLICE CODE
17
City of Odessa, MO
Last Revision  June 25, 2012
3. Knowledge that conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of the existence, meaning or application of the section
defining an offense is not an element of an offense unless the section clearly so provides. [R.S.Mo. 562.021]
2.300-4 CULPABLE MENTAL STATE, WHEN NOT REQUIRED
A culpable mental state is not required:
1. If the offense is an infraction and no culpable mental state is prescribed by the section defining the offense; or
2. If the section defining the offense clearly indicates a purpose to dispense with the requirement of any culpable mental
state as to a specific element of the offense. [R.S.Mo. 562.026]
2.300-5 IGNORANCE AND MISTAKE
A. A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief
of fact or law unless such mistake negatives the existence of the mental state required by the offense.
B. A person is not relieved of liability for conduct because he believes his conduct does not constitute an offense unless
his belief is reasonable and:
1. The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order which is not known to him and has not been
published or otherwise made reasonably available to him, and he could not have acquired such knowledge by
the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him; or
2. He acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or
erroneous, contained in:
(a) A statute or ordinance;
(b) An opinion or order of an appellate court;
(c) An official interpretation of the Statute, regulation, or order defining the offense made by a public official or
agency legally authorized to interpret such Statute, regulation, or order.
3. The burden of injecting the issue of a reasonable belief that conduct does not constitute an offense under
subdivisions (a) and (b) of subsection (2) is on the defendant. [R.S.Mo. 562.031]
2.300-6 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONDUCT
A person with the required culpable mental state is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the
conduct of another person for which he is responsible as set out in section 2.300-7 or both. [R.S.Mo. 562.036]
2.300-7 RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF ANOTHER
A. A person is responsible for the conduct of another when:
1. The section defining the offense makes him so responsible; or
2. Either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose of promoting the commission of an
offense, he aids or agrees to aid or attempts to aid such other person in planning, committing, or attempting to
commit the offense.
B. However, a person is not so responsible if:
1. He is the victim of the offense committed or attempted;
CHAPTER TWO
POLICE CODE
18
City of Odessa, MO
Last Revision  June 25, 2012
2. The offense is so defined that his conduct was necessarily incident to the commission or attempt to commit the
offense. If his conduct constitutes a related but separate offense, he is responsible for that offense but not for
the conduct or offense committed or attempted by the other person;
3. Before the commission of the offense he abandons his purpose and gives timely warning to law enforcement
authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense.
C. The defense provided by subdivision (c) of subsection (2) hereof is an affirmative defense. [R.S.Mo. 562.041]
2.300-8 DEFENSE PRECLUDED
It is no defense to any prosecution for an offense in which the responsibility of the defendant is based upon the conduct of
another that:
a. Such other person has been acquitted or has not been convicted or has been convicted of some other offense or
lacked capacity or was unaware of the defendant's criminal purpose or is immune from prosecution or is not
amenable to justice; or
b. The defendant does not belong to that class of persons who was legally capable of committing the offense in an
individual capacity. [R.S.Mo. 562.046]
2.300-9 ATTEMPT
A. A person is guilty of attempt to commit an offense when with the purpose of committing the offense, he does any act
which is a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. A "Substantial Step" is conduct which is strongly
corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.
B. It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the offense attempted was, under the actual attendant
circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense could have been committed had the
attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.
C. Unless otherwise provided, a person who has been convicted of an attempt to commit an offense may be sentenced
to pay a fine which does not exceed $500.00, or serve a period of imprisonment which shall not exceed thirty (30)
days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. [R.S.Mo. 564.011]
2.300-10 CONSPIRACY
a. A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit an offense if, with the purpose of promoting
or facilitating its commission he agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will
engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
b. If a person guilty of conspiracy knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit an offense has conspired with
another person or persons to commit the same offense, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons to
commit such offense, whether or not he knows their identity.
c. If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple
offenses are the object of the same agreement.
d. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit an offense unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy
is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.

accomplishment of the objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his criminal
purpose.

CHAPTER TWO
POLICE CODE
19
City of Odessa, MO
Last Revision  June 25, 2012
subdivision (a) of this subsection.
f. For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
1. Conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the offense or offenses which are its
object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those
with whom he conspired.
2. If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if he advises those with
whom he has conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of
the conspiracy and of his participation in it.
g. A person may not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct of both the actual
commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.

5. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which
waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection 4 of this section,
and which in the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to live or constitute a
public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
(a) Reject the waste;
(b) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
(c) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(d) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by
existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of subsection 10 of this section.

for the Examination of Waters and Wastewaters," published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect
of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all out
falls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not
always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)

dollar amount per kWh. The total costs above the thresholds will be divided by the total amount of
kWh sold to the Citys electric customers during the previous month, and then multiplied by a factor of
1.02. The resulting amount will be rounded to five decimal places and applied as the next monthly
billing cycle as Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA). This process will be repeated each month following if

The Customer-Generator agrees to carry no less than $100,000 of liability insurance that provides for coverage of all
risk of liability for personal injuries (including death) and damage to property arising out of or caused by the operation
of the Customer-Generator's System. Insurance may be in the form of an existing policy or an endorsement on an
existing policy.
3) Interconnection Costs
The Customer-Generator shall, at the Customer-Generator's cost and expense, install, operate, maintain, repair, and
inspect, and shall be fully responsible for the Customer-Generator's System. The Customer-Generator further agrees
to pay or reimburse to the City of Odessa all of the City of Odessa's Interconnection Costs. Interconnection Costs are
the reasonable costs incurred by the City of Odessa for: (1) additional tests or analyses of the effects of the operation
of the Customer-Generator's System on the City of Odessa 's local distribution system, (2) additional metering, and
(3) any necessary controls. These Interconnection Costs must be related to the installation of the physical facilities
necessary to permit interconnected operation of the Customer-Generator's System with the City of Odessa's system
and shall only include those costs, or corresponding costs, which would not have been incurred by the City of Odessa
in providing service to the Customer-Generator solely as a consumer of electric energy from the City of Odessa
pursuant to the City of Odessa's standard cost of service policies in effect at the time the Customer-Generator's
System is first interconnected with the City of Odessa 's system. Upon request, the City of Odessa shall provide the

default of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so long as the notice specifies the basis for termination,
and there is an opportunity to cure the default. This Agreement may also be terminated at any time by mutual
agreement of the Customer-Generator and the City of Odessa. This agreement may also be terminated, by approval
of the Commission, if there is a change in statute that is determined to be applicable to this contract and necessitates
its termination.
6) Transfer of Ownership
If operational control of the Customer-Generator's System transfers to any other party than the Customer-
Generator, a new Application/Agreement must be completed by the person or persons taking over
operational control of the existing Customer-Generator System. The City of Odessa shall be notified no
less than thirty (30) days before the Customer-Generator anticipates transfer of operational control of the

Generator System completely understand the provisions of this Application/Agreement and agrees to them.
If no changes are being made to the Customer-Generator's System, completing sections A, D and F of this
Application/Agreement will satisfy this requirement. If no changes are being proposed to the Customer-
Generator System, the City of Odessa will assess no charges or fees for this transfer. The City of Odessa
will review the new Application/Agreement and shall approve such, within fifteen (15) days if the new
Customer-Generator has satisfactorily completed the Application/Agreement, and no changes are being
proposed to the existing Customer-Generator System. The City of Odessa will then complete section G
and forward a copy of the completed Application/Agreement back to the new Customer-Generator, thereby
notifying the new Customer-Genera- or that the new Customer-Generator is authorized to operate the
existing Customer-Generator System in parallel with the City of Odessa 's electrical system. If any changes
are planned to be made to the existing Customer-Generator System that in any way may degrade or
significantly alter that System's output characteristics, then the Customer-Generator shall submit to the City
of Odessa a new Application/Agreement for the entire Customer-Generator System and all portions of the
Application/Agreement must be completed.
7) Dispute Resolution
If any disagreements between the Customer-Generator and the City of Odessa arise that cannot be resolved through
normal negotiations between them, the disagreements may be brought to the Missouri Public Service Commission by
either party, through an informal or formal complaint. Procedures for filing and processing these complaints are
described in 4 CSR 240-2.070. The complaint procedures described in 4 CSR 240-2.070 apply only to retail electric
power suppliers to the extent that they are regulated by the Missouri public Service Commission.
8) Testing Requirement
The Customer-Generator must, at least once every year, conduct a test to confirm that the Customer- Generators net
metering unit automatically ceases to energize the output (interconnection equipment output voltage goes to zero)
within two (2) seconds of being disconnected from the City of Odessa's electrical system. Disconnecting the net
metering unit from the City of Odessa's electrical system at the visible disconnect switch and measuring the time
required for the unit to cease to energize the output shall satisfy this test. The Customer-Generator shall maintain a
record of the results of these tests and, upon request by the City of Odessa, shall provide a copy of the test results to
the City of Odessa. If the Customer-Generator is unable to provide a copy of the test results upon request, the City of
Odessa shall notify the Customer-Generator by mail that Customer-Generator has thirty (30) days from the date the
Customer-Generator receives the request to provide to the City of Odessa the results of a test. If the Customer-
Generators equipment ever fails this test, the Customer-Generator shall immediately disconnect the Customer-
Generators System from the City of Odessa 's system. If the Customer-Generator does not provide results of a test to
the City of Odessa within thirty (30) days of receiving a request from the City of Odessa or the results of the test
provided to the City of Odessa show that the Customer-Generators net metering unit is not functioning correctly, the
City of Odessa may immediately disconnect the Customer-Generators System from the City of Odessa 's system.

or she shall determine whether the fee is appropriate. The City will require as a condition of the right to such an

SUBCHAPTER E, NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES OF LAND
8.500 NONCONFORMITIES IN GENERAL
Within the zoning districts established by this Chapter or its subsequent amendment, there exist a) lots;
b) structures; c) uses of structures; e) uses of land and structures in combination; and f) characteristics
of use, which were lawful before this Chapter was adopted or amended, but which would now be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Chapter or its subsequent amendment. Such
instances shall hereafter be considered lawful nonconformities.
8.501 STATEMENT OF INTENT
(a) It is the intent of this Chapter to recognize the legitimate interest of owners of lawful nonconformities
by allowing such lawful nonconformities to continue, but to control the expansion of the nonconformity
and to control re-establishment of abandoned uses and limit re-establishment of buildings and structures
hat have been substantially destroyed. At the same time, it is recognized that lawful nonconformities
may substantially and adversely affect the orderly development, maintenance, use and taxable value of
other property in the same zoning district, property that is itself subject to the regulations and terms of
this Chapter. In order to secure eventual compliance with the standards of this Chapter, it is therefore
necessary to carefully regulate lawful nonconformities and to prohibit the re-establishment of such
nonconformities that have discontinued.
(b) To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to
the adoption or amendment of this Chapter and upon which actual building construction has been
carried on diligently. Actual building construction is hereby defined to include the placement of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
8.501-1 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS CHAPTER
For purposes of this section only, the effective date of this Chapter shall be presumed to be September
24, 2012, or the date of annexation of the subject property, whichever is later. The reference shall
include the effective date of any ordinance that amends this Chapter, if the ordinance, rather than this
Chapter as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.
8.502 POLICY
It is the general policy of the City to allow uses, structures or lots that came into existence legally and in
conformance with then-applicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable
requirements of this Development Code to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring as
many aspects of such use into conformance with the current Development Code as is reasonably
practicable, all subject to the limitations of this Chapter.
(a) The regulations address the following types of nonconformities:
(1) Nonconforming use. A primary use of property existing on the effective date of this
subchapter that occurs when the property is used for a purpose or in any manner made
unlawful by the use regulations or performance and design standards applicable to the zoning
district in which the property is located. The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the
use made of the property.
(2) Nonconforming structures. Buildings and structures, not including signs, legally
established prior to the effective date of this subchapter that do not conform with the property
development standards of the zoning district in which the use is located. The nonconformance
CHAPTER EIGHT
ZONING REGULATIONS
58
City of Odessa, MO
Last Revision Date  August 25, 2014
may be attributed to size, nature of construction, location of the structure or building on the
land, or its proximity to another structure or building.
(3) Nonconforming signs. Refer to Sign Ordinance.
(4) Nonconforming Site Improvement. A nonconforming situation existing on the effective date
of this Chapter that occurs when a site improvement on a lot, including but not limited to
parking areas, storm drainage facilities, sidewalks and landscaping, does not conform to one or
more of the applicable zoning district regulations.
(5) Nonconforming Situation. A situation that occurs when, on the effective date of this
Chapter, an existing lot, structure or improvement, or the use of an existing lot, structure or
improvement no longer conforms to one or more of the applicable zoning district regulations.
8.502-2 Authority to Continue. Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the
regulations of this Chapter.
8.502-3 Determination of Nonconformity Status. The burden of establishing that nonconformity lawfully
exists is to be the owner's burden and not the City's.
8.502-4 Repairs and Maintenance. Minor repairs and normal maintenance required to keep nonconforming
uses, nonconforming structures and nonconforming signs in a safe condition shall be
permitted, provided that no alterations shall be made except those allowed by this Chapter or required
by law or ordinance. Minor repairs or maintenance shall be defined as costs that do not exceed ten (10)
percent of the structural value of a structure or site improvement.
8.502-5 Change of Tenancy or Ownership. Changes of tenancy, ownership or management of an
existing nonconformity shall be permitted, provided there is no change in the nature or character, extent
or intensity of such nonconformity.
8.503 NONCONFORMING USES
Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following standards.
(a) Enlargement. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy a
greater area of land or floor area than was occupied on effective date of this subchapter and no
additional accessory use, building or structure shall be established on the site of a nonconforming use.
This provision notwithstanding, uses may be extended throughout any part of a building or other
structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use on effective date of this
subchapter.
(b) Relocation. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of
such parcel nor to another lot unless the use will be in conformance with the use regulations of the
district into which it is moved.
(c) Discontinuance and Abandonment. If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period
of more than six (6) consecutive months (except where government action causes such cessation), the
subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the regulations and provisions set by this Code for
the district in which such parcel or lot is located.
(d) Damage or Destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its structural value prior to such destruction, that structure shall not be restored unless the
structure and its use conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. The
determination of such reduced structural valuation shall be made by the Building Official. Structural value
shall be defined as the present day cost of a structure or its replacement value if destroyed.
CHAPTER EIGHT
ZONING REGULATIONS
59
City of Odessa, MO
Last Revision Date  August 25, 2014
(e) Change in Use. The initial determination of whether a proposed use is a conforming use or is
less intense shall be made by the Building Official, with an appeal to the Board of Adjustment. A
nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use or less intensive nonconforming use, may not
thereafter be changed back to a less conforming use than that to which it was changed.
(f) Residential Uses in Non-Residential Districts. The other provisions of this Section
notwithstanding, any structure that is devoted to a nonconforming residential use and that is located in a
more restrictive district may be remodeled, extended, expanded and enlarged; provided that after any
such remodeling, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to
accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to
any such work.
(g) Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue
after such principal use ceases or terminates.
8.504 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following standards:
(a) Enlargement. Any expansion of a nonconforming structure that increases the degree of
nonconformance shall be prohibited. Other expansions of the structure shall be permitted and shall not
require a variance. The initial determination of whether a proposed expansion increases the degree of
nonconformity shall be made by the Building Official with an appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
(b) Damage or Destruction: In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed,
by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to such
destruction, such structure shall not be restored except in conformance with the regulations for the
zoning district in which it is located. Structural value shall be defined as the present day cost of a
structure or its replacement value if destroyed. The determination of such reduced structural valuation
shall be made by the Building Official.
When a structure is damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or less, no repairs or restoration shall
be made unless a building permit is obtained within three (3) months and restoration is actually begun
within six (6) months after the date of such partial destruction.
Exception: Lawful nonconforming structures that are single family detached dwellings, duplexes or
townhouses of not more than 2 laterally attached single family dwellings, or multi-family
dwellings/townhouses not exceeding 4 units may be reconstructed to their former condition, dimensions
and location on the lot provided that the destruction was caused by an accident or act of God occurring
after the adoption of this Chapter. Such reconstruction shall not increase the degree of nonconformity
that existed prior to the destruction. Reconstruction of the above specified lawful nonconformity, where
permitted, must commence within six (6) months of destruction. In such case where reconstruction does
not commence within this limited time frame, the nonconformity will be considered abandoned and the
structure shall only be reconstructed as a permitted use.
(c) Relocation. Nonconforming structures shall not be moved unless the movement or relocation will
bring the structure into compliance with all applicable zoning district regulations.
8.505 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS Refer to Sign Ordinance
8.506 OTHER NONCONFORMITIES
(a) Applicability. The types of other nonconformities to which this Section applies include, but are
not necessarily limited to: fence height or location; lack of or inadequate landscape buffers; lack of or

Last Revision Date  August 25, 2014
inadequate landscaping; lack of or inadequate off-street parking; and other nonconformities not involving
zoning district use or property development standards.
(b) Enlargement or Change in Use. Where an addition, enlargement or change in use is proposed
to an extent in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the floor area of the existing buildings or structures, the
entire lot shall be brought into conformance with presently existing requirements of this Code as to
landscaping, buffering, off-street parking and other non-use and non-property development regulations
of this Code.
(c) Non-Conformities Created By Public Action. When lot area or setbacks are reduced as a result
of conveyance to a Federal, State or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the required minimum standard for the district in which it is located,
then that lot shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and setback standards of
this Code without resort to the Board of Adjustment.
(d) Livestock. Raising and harboring livestock, as defined in Section 8.105 of this Code, on nonagricultural
zoned property annexed into the city limits of Odessa, shall be permitted as a legal nonconforming
use provided:
(1) There is no increase in the quantity of livestock animals on the property.
(2) No other type of livestock is introduced onto the property.
(3) Should the number of existing livestock decrease and is not replaced within thirty (30) days
time, the new lower quantity of livestock shall be the maximum allowed as a legal nonconforming

SUBCHAPTER B DESIGN
9.200 URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of design of the individual subdivisions that
compose it. Good community design requires the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer or
land within the urban area. Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the
principles established by the City Plan for land use, circulation, community facilities and public utility services and
in accordance with the following general principles:
A. It is intended that the urban area shall be designed as a group of integrated residential neighborhoods and
appropriate commercial and industrial and public facilities. The neighborhood, as a planning unit, is intended as
an area principally for residential use, and of a size that can be served by one elementary school. Space for
religious, recreational, educational and shopping facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be
provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood.
B. The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential, commercial, industrial and public uses should be
designed to provide adequate light, air, open space, landscaping, and off-street parking and loading facilities.
C. The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most
advantageous use of topography and natural physical features. Tree masses and large individual trees should be
preserved. The system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of
the visual qualities of the area.
D. Circulation within the urban area shall be provided in accordance with the following design criteria:
1. Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all arterial streets and highways as shown on the Major
Street Plan as adopted. Arterial streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood.
2. Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel of land within the residential neighborhood
and within industrial areas, and in a manner that will discourage use by through traffic. They should be planned so
that future urban expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets to arterial routes.
3. Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from other minor streets to the major streets and
expressway system.
4. Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided only on minor streets.
5. Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by vehicular traffic. Sidewalks should be designed
to provide all residential building sites with direct access to all neighborhood facilities, including the elementary
school, parks, playgrounds, churches, and shopping centers.
E. Minimum standard for development are contained in the zoning ordinance, the building code and in these
regulations. However, the City Plan expresses policies designed to achieve an optimum quality of development in
the urban area. If only the minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various ordinances regulating
land development, a standardization of development will occur. This will produce a monotonous urban setting.
Subdivision design should be of a quality to carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the City
Plan and in these regulations rather than be limited to the minimum standards required herein.

SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
9.201-1 STREETS
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to all of the
elements of the City Plan and shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions:
1. Major streets shall be planned to conform with the Major Street Plan.
2. Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the Planning
Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line, deep lots, or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
3. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
4. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way the Planning and Zoning

the Planning and Zoning Commission Chairman. Unless stipulation for additional time is agreed to by the

those parts of the City Plan or ordinance with which the plat does not comply. [R.S.Mo. 89.420]

by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, paragraph,
provision or portion of these Regulations.
