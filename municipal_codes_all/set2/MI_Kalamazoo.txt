Ord. No. 1934]
or regulation shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500 and
costs of prosecution, or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days,
or by both such fine and imprisonment. In the event that a violation of
this Code substantially corresponds to a violation of state law punishable
by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than
$500, or both, then this Code may provide for the imposition of that
punishment, as provided by state law. Each act of violation and every
day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate
offense.
B. The general misdemeanor penalties provided by this section, unless
another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to any amendment of
this Code, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory
ordinance.
C. In addition to the penalties provided in this section, the City may enjoin
or abate any violation of this Code or any rule or regulation adopted
under this Code by appropriate action and may avail itself of any other
remedy provided by law to enforce this Code or such rule or regulation.
A. As used in this Code, "municipal civil infraction" includes, but is not
limited to, a trailway municipal civil infraction. The procedures in a
municipal civil infraction action shall be administered in accordance with
MCLA § 600.8701 et seq. A person receiving a municipal civil infraction
citation for a violation of a City ordinance shall respond to the citation
within the time period specified on the citation by admitting
responsibility for the municipal civil infraction, admitting responsibility
for the municipal civil infraction "with explanation," or by requesting an
informal hearing or a formal hearing. If a person admits responsibility for
a municipal civil infraction "with explanation," the court may consider
the person's explanation by way of mitigating any sanction which the
court may order. A person charged with a municipal civil infraction is not
entitled to a jury trial. The burden of proof at an informal hearing or a
formal hearing on a municipal civil infraction shall be by a
preponderance of the evidence. The plaintiff and defendant are entitled
to appeal an adverse judgment entered at an informal hearing to a
formal hearing before a judge of the 8th District Court.
B. If the person to whom a municipal civil infraction citation is issued fails to
appear as directed by the citation or fails to appear at a scheduled
hearing, the court shall enter a default judgment against that person. If a
defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, costs, or, if applicable,
damages or expenses as ordered, the court may require the defendant
to show cause why the default should not be treated as in civil contempt
and may issue a summons or order to show cause or a bench warrant of
arrest for the defendant's appearance, and the defendant may incur
additional sanctions or penalties as provided in MCLA § 600.8727
through MCLA § 600.8729.

legally authorized to issue and serve municipal civil infraction citations,

ordinance, as an alterative to filing an order allowing issuance of a
warrant, the City Attorney may issue a written order for the issuance of a
summons to be issued from the appropriate court, addressed to a
defendant, directing the defendant to appear before a District Judge at a
designated future time for proceedings as hereinafter set forth. Such
summons shall issue from the appropriate court. It shall designate the
name of the issuing court, the offense charged in the underlying
complaint and the name of the defendant to whom it is addressed and it
shall be subscribed by the issuing judicial officer.
B. The summons provided for in this section shall be served by a police
officer, district court process server, buildings-housing inspector or other
persons authorized by the City Attorney.
C. The defendant shall not be fingerprinted or photographed in connection
with the process provided for in this section, unless it is ordered by the
City Attorney.
D. If the defendant does not appear in the designated court at the time the
summons issued under this section is returnable, the court may issue a
bench warrant for the arrest of the defendant or may issue a warrant
therefor based upon the complaint filed.
A. Prosecution for violations of any of the following provisions of the
Kalamazoo City Code may be commenced by the issuing of an
appearance ticket: Chapters 4, 7, 8, 17, 18A, 18B, 21, 24, 25, and 37;
Article III of Chapter 15; Article I of Chapter 23; Article V of Chapter 33;

appearance ticket officers and authorized to issue and serve appearance
tickets. The City Manager or the Chief of Public Safety also may
designate other City employees as appearance ticket officers. Those City
employees designated as appearance ticket officers by the City Manager
or Chief of Public Safety are authorized to issue and serve appearance
tickets only for the specific sections of the Code as designated by the
City Manager or Chief of Public Safety.
A. Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by
amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of
this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of
Ordinances, City of Kalamazoo, Michigan (or Kalamazoo Code), is hereby
amended to read as follows: _____." The new provisions shall then be set
out in full as desired.
B. In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be
added, the following language shall be used: "That the Code of
Ordinances, City of Kalamazoo, Michigan (or Kalamazoo Code), is hereby
amended by adding a section, to be numbered _____, which said section
reads as follows: _____." The new section shall then be set out in full as
desired.
A. By contract or by City personnel, supplements to this Code shall be
prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the City
Commission. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive
permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period
covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.
The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit
properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which
have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be
so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current
through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the
supplement.
B. In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which
have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission
thereof from reprinted pages.
C. When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the
person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement)
may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of
ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so
to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:
(1) Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
§ 1-8.1 KALAMAZOO CODE § 1-10
1:8
§ 1-11. Responsibility of officers with respect to assigned copies of
Code.
Each City officer assigned a copy of this Code shall be responsible for
maintaining the same and for the proper insertion of amendatory pages as
received. Each such copy shall remain the property of the City and shall
be turned over by the officer having custody thereof, upon expiration of his
term of office, to his successor or to the City Clerk, in case he shall have no
successor.
§ 1-12. Severability.
Should any provision or section of this Code be held unconstitutional or
invalid, such holding shall not be construed as affecting the validity of
any of the remaining provisions or sections, it being the intent of the City
Commission that this Code shall stand, notwithstanding the invalidity of any
provision or section thereof. The provisions of this section shall apply to the
amendment of any section of this Code, whether or not the wording of this
section is set forth in the amendatory ordinance.
(2) Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and
other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make
changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;
(3) Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new
material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;
(4) Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to
"this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be,
or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate
the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of
the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in
no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect
of ordinance material included in the supplement or already
embodied in the Code.

The City of Kalamazoo Employees Retirement System established by
authority of § 197 of the Charter and Ordinance No. 378, as amended, is
hereby continued, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2006. This
article may be cited as the "City of Kalamazoo Employee Retirement System
Ordinance." The Retirement System Ordinance shall be maintained for the
exclusive benefit of members and is intended to qualify as a governmental
plan under Sections 401(a) and 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended from time to time (the "Code"), and with the requirements of
any other applicable law.
§ 2-224. Definitions.

meaning is clearly required by the context, shall have the following

income under Code Section 125, 132(f), 401(k), 403(b) or 457(b). In case a
member's compensation is not all paid in money, the City Manager shall fix
the value of the portion of his or her compensation that is not paid in money.
Compensation shall not include any sums paid to a member as worker's
compensation or contractual supplements thereto, unless the following
requirements are both fulfilled:
The member is in receipt of said sums while the member is off work
during the final three years of his or her membership because of a
disability which, if permanent, would qualify him or her for a duty
disability retirement allowance under § 2-243B; and
(1)
The member contributes the prescribed percentage of said sums
to the annuity savings fund under § 2-248B within 180 calendar

contribution "picked-up" by the City and treated as an employer
contribution pursuant to § 2-248F.

before plan year 2002, the annual compensation of each member taken
into account under the retirement system shall not exceed the OBRA
'93 annual compensation limit. The OBRA '93 annual compensation
limit is $150,000, as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in
the cost of living in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). If

CREDITED SERVICE — The number of years and fraction thereof standing
to a member's credit, as provided in this article. Effective January 1, 1999,
as to Public Safety members, and effective March 13, 2000, as to KMEA
members, the amount of service time that will be credited to such a member
who is classified and worked as a part-time employee of the City will be
calculated by pro-rating the number of hours worked in a year against the
number of hours regularly scheduled in that year for a full-time employee in
that classification. For example, an employee who works 30 hours per week
in a position where full-time employees regularly work 40 hours per week
will be credited with 00.75 year of service for that year. For Public Safety
members, credited service as of January 1, 1999, shall be the amount of time
which has elapsed between that date and each individual's seniority date,
in addition to any time purchased pursuant to the split-service provisions
set forth below. When a Public Safety member is absent from work and
receiving sick pay benefits (either the member's or from donated sick leave
time) from which pension contributions are deducted, the period of time
the employee is absent and receiving sick leave benefits will be counted
towards the member's credited service. Public Safety members on medical
leave of absence who are receiving worker's compensation benefits may
have period of such leave counted towards credited service by electing at
the commencement of the leave to make regular pension contributions while
on the leave.
DIRECT ROLLOVER — A payment by the retirement system to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
DISTRIBUTEE — An employee or former employee. In addition, the
employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or
compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account
in determining an employee's benefits accruing in the current plan year,
the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the
OBRA '93 annual compensation limit in effect for that prior determination
period. For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before the
first day of the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the
OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.
The annual compensation of the member taken into account in
determining benefit accruals under the retirement system in any plan
year beginning after December 31, 2001, or such other consecutive
twelve-month period over which Compensation is otherwise determined
under the retirement system (the "determination period") shall not
exceed $200,000, as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the
cost of living in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B).
E.
The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to
any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is
determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If
a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual
compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of months in the determination period, and the
denominator of which is 12.

(4) The medical director and the actuary; nor
(5) (Reserved)25
(6) The City Manager or other City Commission appointee, if he or she
exempts himself or herself from membership in the system. His or
her past contributions, together with accrued interest, would then
be paid into the program established by the International City
Management Association Retirement Corporation instead of being
paid to or held by the City of Kalamazoo Employees Retirement
System. No contribution on behalf of the City Manager or other
appointee who makes such choice shall thereafter be made to the
retirement system. Neither he nor she nor any person claiming on
his or her behalf or account shall have any right, title, benefit or
interest in said system or the funds thereof. The system shall owe no
duty to such person or persons; nor

judges of the 9th District Court, unless such person, prior to that
date elected to have his or her contributions remain in the system.

Board shall decide the question.
A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, members who leave the
employ of the City for any reason except retirement or death shall
thereupon cease to be members and their credited service at that time
shall be forfeited. In the event of reemployment by the City, such
individuals shall again become members. Such employees shall have the
option of having their credited service restored in full, provided they
return to the annuity savings fund the amount, if any, withdrawn
25.Editor's Note: Former Subsection B(5), regarding retirants reemployed by the City, was
repealed 6-29-2009 by Ord. No. 1855.

therefrom, together with regular interest from the date of withdrawal to
the date of repayment.
B. In the event any member, or part-time employee who, full-time, would
be a member, leaves the employment of the City to provide data
processing services to the City, and said member or employee returns to
City employment immediately upon leaving the employment of said
private entity, and he or she has again become a member pursuant to
the subsection above, he or she may also receive credited service for the
time spent with said private entity as long as his or her employment with
said private entity has been full-time and continuous since leaving the
employment of the City, and he or she pays to the retirement system the
contributions he or she would have made had he or she remained or
been a member of the system, based on the actual salary received from
the private entity during this time period.
C. Said payments shall commence within one year of reemployment and
shall be completed within a five-year period from the date of rehiring. If
repayment is not completed within the five-year period, any amounts
paid are to be refunded, and credit for pension benefits will be computed
from the most current date of employment. Current employees shall
have one year from the effective date of this section, as amended, to
start repayment, and completion shall be within the five-year time limit.
Upon a member's retirement or death, he shall thereupon cease to be a
member.
D. However, a person retired from the system may "buy back" prior service
credits to increase his or her pension:
(1) When the retirant would have been eligible to buy back prior service
time credit(s), if the retirant were an active (contributing,
nonretired) member of the system; and
(2) When such credit(s) was(were) not available for buy back prior to
the date of his or her retirement; and
(3) When election, payment and completion shall be as follows:
(a) Said retirant shall elect to buy back such prior service credit(s)
within one year of the date the retirant is or becomes eligible to
buy back such time credit(s);
(b) Calculation of prior service credits:
[1] Per Subsection D(3)(a) above for refunded prior service
credit; and/or
[2] Such retroactive contributions shall be made together with
"regular interest" or a Board-approved actuarial formula
calculated to the date of repayment; and
(4) Applications for repurchase of prior City service credit(s) shall be
made within one year from the date on which the retirant first

1:X-11
§ 2-229. Service credit.
§ 2-230. Age and service requirements in event of split service.
becomes eligible to exercise the option to "buy back" prior City
service credit(s);
(5) From the date on which the retirant's application to repurchase prior
City service is approved by the Board, the retirant will have one
additional year to actually repurchase such prior service by lump
sum repayment, unless an extended period is approved by the
Board;
(6) An increased pension will not be put into effect for any retirant until
the repayment of previously refunded employee pension
contributions, and regular interest, is complete.
A. The service rendered by a member shall be credited him or her by the
Board in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Board shall
from time to time adopt, consistent with the provisions of this article. In
no case shall fewer than 10 days of service rendered by a member in any
calendar month be credited him or her as a month of service, nor shall
fewer than nine months of service rendered by him or her in any
calendar year be credited as a year of service, nor shall more than one
year of service be credited any member for all service rendered by him
or her in any calendar year.
B. In the event a member withdrew his or her contributions from the
retirement annuity and pension fund of the retirement system
established by Ordinance No. 188, or his or her accumulated
contributions from the annuity savings fund of the retirement system
provided for in this article, and has not returned same to the applicable
fund, he or she shall not be credited with service rendered prior to the
date he or she last withdrew his or her contributions or accumulated
contributions until he or she returns to the annuity savings fund,
together with regular interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of
repayment, as provided in § 2-228 of this article.
A. In the event a member has rendered service both as a general member
and as a Public Safety member, the age and service requirements
applicable to that member at the time of retirement shall be determined
by the age and service requirements of the unit from which the member
is retiring. The member's total service shall be used to determine
whether or not the member meets the age and service requirements of
the unit from which he is retiring.
B. For purposes of computing the retirement allowance of a member who
has rendered service in both of the above units, § 2-236 shall apply only
to the member's actual service as a Public Safety member; and § 2-237
shall apply only to the member's actual service as a general member.
The retirement allowance shall be the sum of the two separate
§ 2-228 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-230
1:X-12
§ 2-231. Military service credit.
computations. The computations for each unit shall be based on the
member's actual final average compensation.
C. Notwithstanding the above, a member employed by Public Safety who is
a member of the Kalamazoo Police Officers' Association prior to 1999
may elect to convert his or her prior non-Public Safety time into Public
Safety time (for purposes of credited service) so long as he or she first
pays the difference between the contribution rate that was paid and the
contribution rate that would have been paid had the non-Public Safety
time actually been for Public Safety.
A. In the event any member, while employed by the City, was called to or
entered any armed service of the United States and has been or shall be
on active duty in such armed service, said member shall have such
armed service actually required credited as City service; provided that:
(1) He or she is reemployed by the City within one year from and after
the date of termination of such armed service actually required of
him or her.
(2) He or she returns to the annuity savings fund the amount he or she
might have withdrawn therefrom at the time he or she entered or
while in such armed service together with regular interest from the
date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. Said payments shall
commence within one year of reemployment and shall be completed
within five years from the date of rehiring. If repayment is not
completed within the five-year period, any amounts paid are to be
refunded, and credit for pension benefits will be computed from the
most current date of employment.
(3) In no case shall more than six years of City service be credited for all
such armed service rendered by said member. In any case of doubt
as to the period to be so credited any member, the Board shall have
the final power to determine such period. During the period of such
armed service and until reemployment by the City, said member's
contributions to the retirement system shall be suspended; and any
balance standing to his or her credit in the annuity savings fund
shall be accumulated at regular interest.
B. In the event any member, prior to being employed by the City, was
called to or entered any armed service of the United States and who has
been on active duty in such armed service, said member may have his or
her service credit increased for not more than three years' active military
service; provided that:
(1) The member pays to the retirement system a percent of the
member's annual rate of pay in effect at the time the member
applies for this option, multiplied by the years, or fraction thereof, of
service that the member elects to purchase pursuant to this section.
§ 2-230 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-231
1:X-13
The percent to be used in said calculation shall be the same as the
percent in effect used to determine that member's contribution to
the annuity fund, as described in § 2-248 and elsewhere.
(2) Time of payment. Said payment shall commence within one year
from the date of hire and shall be completed within five years. If
payment is not completed within the five-year period, any amounts
paid are to be refunded, and no credit for military service pension
benefits will be given.
(3) The fact that payment is made into the retirement system during a
given year for the purposes of Subsection B(1) above shall have no
effect in determining final average compensation.
(4) In the event any member making payments under Subsection B(1)
above should retire or die prior to making the full payments
required, the member or member's beneficiary under the pension
ordinance shall have the option of either making a lump-sum
payment in full prior to receiving any pension benefits in order to
obtain the additional benefits under this section, or receiving
military service credit prorated based upon the amount of payments
made until death or retirement.
(5) At any time prior to retirement, a member may withdraw all or part
of his or her military service credit payments from the retirement
system. If a member makes such a withdrawal, the military service
credit will be reduced pro rata, based upon the amount of payments
withdrawn.
C. Active duty shall include all service and training while on active duty but
shall not include National Guard or Reserve monthly or annual training.
D. Current employees must commence payment no later than January 2,
1987, to obtain credit for military service under this section of the
Kalamazoo City Code. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply
to any military service covered by USERRA. Payment shall be completed
within five years of commencement of payment.
E. In no event shall credit be given for a period of active duty if the member
otherwise receives credit for that period as City service.
F. Effective December 12, 1994, the provisions herein shall be interpreted
and applied as required by USERRA in accordance with Code Section
414(u) and the regulations and other guidance thereunder.
G. Effective with respect to deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2007,
while a member is performing qualified military service (as defined in
Chapter 43 of Title 38, United States Code), to the extent required by
Section 401(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code, survivors of a member
in a state or local retirement or pension system are entitled to any
additional benefits that the system would provide if the member had
resumed employment and then died, such as accelerated vesting or

§ 2-232. Buyback of unpaid leave.
A Public Safety member who, on or after January 1, 1999, is absent from work
for an entire pay period during which no pay from the City is paid from which
pension contributions are deducted, may buy back all or a portion of said
time so that it becomes credited service. In the absence of said buyback,
said time shall not become credited service. If the member elects to buy
back such time, the amount to be paid by the member shall be equal to that
which the member would have had deducted from his or her pay had he or
she been receiving pay. Said payment shall commence within one year of
the member's return and shall be completed within five years of said return.
If repayment for the amount of time sought to be credited is not fully paid
within said five years, the amount paid shall be refunded and no credited
service shall be given.

Internal Revenue Code, an individual receiving differential wage
payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer,
and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation
for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section
415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. This provision shall be applied
to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.

member who has 25 years or more of credited service or who is at least
50 years of age with 10 years of credited service, a voluntary retirement

years of service. Those Public Safety members whose employment ends
after they are vested but prior to achieving 20 years of credited service
may receive a retirement allowance based upon a two-percent

accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the
annuity savings fund at the time of his or her retirement; and
(2) A pension that, when added to his or her annuity, will provide a
straight life retirement allowance equal to the number of years and
fraction of a year of his or her credited service multiplied by the
percents set forth below of his or her final average compensation:
(a) For a general member represented by the Kalamazoo Municipal
Employees Association who retires in 2006, the multiplier shall
be 1.9% of his or her final average compensation, but on or
after January 1, 2007, the multiplier shall be 2% of his or her
final average compensation; further, a post-retirement
adjustment of 1.5%, compounded annually, shall be provided to
those KMEA members who retire on or after March 13, 2000, so
long as said retirant has been retired for one year (if he or she
retires at or after age 63) or upon the retirant's 64th birthday (if
he or she retires prior to age 63); said post-retirement
adjustment shall not apply to deferred retirements.
(b) For an exempt employee who retires on or after January 1,
1999, the multiplier shall be increased to 2.3% of his or her final
average compensation;
(c) For a member represented by AFSCME who retires on or after

but if on or after October 2, 2007, the multiplier shall be 2.1% of
his or her final average compensation; further, a postretirement
allowance of one percent, commencing one year
after the member's date of retirement and compounded
annually thereafter, shall be provided to those AFSCME
members who retire on or after March 1, 2000; after the retirant
reaches age 75, said annual adjustment shall be two percent,
compounded annually. The retirement adjustment shall not,
however, apply to those who retire pursuant to a deferred and /
or a reduced retirement;
(d) For a member represented by the ATU, the multiplier shall be
2.1% of his or her final average compensation; further, a postretirement
allowance of 1%, commencing one year after the
member's date of retirement and compounded annually
thereafter, shall be provided to those ATU members who retire
on or after March 1, 2000; after the retirant reaches age 75, said
annual adjustment shall be 2%, compounded annually. The

retirement allowance provided in Subsection A of this section shall be
reduced 0.4% multiplied by the number of months and fraction of a
month contained in the period from the date of his or her retirement to
the date he or she would attain the age of 62. In the event a general
member who has 25 or more years of credited service retires on or after
January 1, 1974, and before his or her attainment of the age of 57, the
pension portion of his or her retirement allowance provided in
Subsection A of this section shall be reduced 0.4% multiplied by the
number of months and fraction of a month contained in the period from
the date of his or her retirement to the date he or she would have
attained the age of 57. A general member who retires on or after July 26,
2017, with credited service with a state unit or municipal unit that has
elected to adopt the provisions of the Reciprocal Retirement Act, being
Public Act 88 of 1961, as amended, is permitted to apply previous
credited service with a reciprocal unit so as to permit the member to
achieve 25 years of credited service to avoid the reduction in retirement
allowance as otherwise required by this section. [Amended
12-18-2017 by Ord. No. 1952]
C. The pension of a general member represented by AFSCME who retires on
or after October 1, 1990, shall not be subject to reduction under
Subsection B if the member at the time of retirement is at least 60 years
of age and has at least 20 years of credited service in a position or
positions represented by AFSCME.
D. The foregoing benefit levels are subject to the limits set forth in § 2-263.
E. The retirement allowance received by an exempt member who retires on
or after June 1, 2006, shall be increased by 1.5% post-retirement
allowance, compounded annually, commencing January 1 after the
member has been retired for one full year, and on every January 1
thereafter; this increase shall be available, however, only to those
members whose retirement allowance has not been, nor will be, deferred
and who execute and submit, no later than May 30, 2006, the required
form in which the member agrees to have his or her contribution to the
annuity fund increased, for the balance of the member's employment
with the City, by 2%, above and beyond that otherwise required by
§ 2-248, including as it may be amended from time to time.

According to such rules and regulations as the Board shall from time to time
adopt, a general member who retires prior to his or her attainment of age
62 years may elect to have his or her straight life retirement allowance
actuarially equated to provide an increased retirement allowance payable to
his or her attainment of age 62 years and a reduced retirement allowance
payable thereafter. His or her increased retirement allowance payable to his
or her attainment of age 62 years shall approximate the sum of his or her
A. For the purpose of this section, "eligible members" is defined as being
those members:
(1) Who by December 31, 2015, would either:
(a) Satisfy the age and credited service requirements so as to be
then eligible to retire with a full (unreduced) retirement
allowance; or
(b) Have 25 years of credited service, regardless of age; and
(c) In the case of Public Safety members only, be entitled to receive
the 2.7% multiplier; and
(2) Who, before 5:00 p.m. January 3, 2012, declare an irrevocable intent

form to be created hereafter by the Human Resources Department.
B. Eligible members shall receive the following:
(1) A retirement allowance, the calculation for which shall assume
credited service through December 31, 2015; if, however, the City
determines that the last day of work for an eligible member who
elects to participate is to be after December 31, 2012, the
calculation shall assume credited service three years after that
member's last day of work;
(2) A one-time retirement system lump sum payment equal to 1% of the
member's final average compensation times his or her credited
service (as such is determined by Subsection B(1) immediately
above); and
(3) Payment, at the time of retirement, of any sums due to the member
by virtue of existing collective bargaining agreements and/or
existing City policy for accrued vacation and/or sick time, accrued as
of the last day of work; in the case of Amalgamated Transit Union
members, any sums due to a member by virtue of existing collective
bargaining agreements for accrued leave time accrued as of the last

estimated social security primary insurance amount. This section shall not
apply to a member who elects Option A, B or C provided in § 2-240, or who
retires under § 2-242.
§ 2-239. Deferred retirement allowance.
A. In the event a Public Safety member who has 10 or more years of
credited service leaves the employ of the City prior to his or her
voluntary retirement age, for any reason except his or her retirement or
death, he or she shall be entitled to a retirement allowance provided for
in § 2-236A. In the event a general member has acquired the minimum
number of years of credited service to satisfy the voluntary retirement
age requirement and leaves the employ of the City prior to his or her
voluntary retirement age, for any reason except his or her retirement or
death, he or she shall be entitled to a retirement allowance provided for
in § 2-237. In either case, his or her retirement allowance shall be
computed according to § 2-236 or 2-237, as applicable, as the section
was in effect at the time the member left City employment. The
member's retirement allowance shall begin the first day of the calendar
month next following the date his or her application for same is filed with
the Board on or after his or her attainment of age 60 years if a general
member, 55 years if a general member with 15 years of service, or 50
years if a Public Safety member; provided, however, effective January 1,
1984, any Public Safety member shall be eligible after 25 years of
credited service or age 50 with 10 years of credited service, whichever
occurs first. If he or she withdraws his or her accumulated contributions,
he or she shall thereupon forfeit his or her right to a deferred retirement
allowance. A member shall also forfeit his or her right to a deferred
retirement allowance if said member dies before filing said application
or, if such an application is filed, before the date designated as his or her
retirement date. In the event of such a death, the member's
accumulated contributions shall be paid to his or her beneficiary or
estate. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the member shall not
be given service credit for the period or his or her absence from City
employment. [Amended 10-4-2010 by Ord. No. 1874]
B. Should any member, with five or more years of credited service, who has
not qualified for a deferred retirement allowance provided in Subsection
A of this section, be transferred by the City to the payroll of the State of
Michigan or any of its political subdivisions, service rendered by him or
her in the employ of the state or any of its political subdivisions
subsequent to his or her transfer shall be regarded as City service for the
sole and exclusive purpose only of qualifying for a deferred retirement
allowance provided in Subsection A of this section and in determining
final average compensation. The member's retirement allowance shall
be computed according to § 2-236 or 2-237, as applicable at the time of
his or her last termination of membership, based upon his or her credited
service rendered in the employ of the City. The member's retirement
allowance shall begin 30 days after the date his or her application for
same is filed with the Board on or after the date he or she leaves the
§ 2-238 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-239
1:X-20
employ of the state or any of its political subdivisions to whose payroll
he or she was transferred, or attains age 60 years, whichever is later. In
the event the member withdraws his or her accumulated contributions,
he or she shall thereupon forfeit his or her entitlement to a retirement
allowance provided in this subsection. If the member withdrew his or
her accumulated contributions prior to February 1, 1958, he or she shall
have the right to repay the amount withdrawn, together with regular
interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment, subject to
the approval of the Board.
C. Any deferred retirement allowance payable hereunder shall satisfy the
minimum distribution requirements set forth in § 2-240C.
D. Election to enter DROP. [Added 4-2-2018 by Ord. No. 1959]
(1) Effective April 12, 2018, a Public Safety Administrator who meets
the relevant provisions for an unreduced retirement allowance
under Subsection A or B of this section, and who is authorized by the
City Manager, with the approval of the City Commission, to
participate in this deferred retirement option plan ("DROP"), may

contributions to the plan.
(c) The member must elect a DROP retirement date not less than

(d) The member may make an election to enter DROP only once in
the member's lifetime.
(e) The member may not remain in DROP after the date the
member reaches any mandatory retirement age that may apply
to the member.
E. Termination of employment; determination of benefit. [Added
4-2-2018 by Ord. No. 1959]
(1) The retirement benefit for a member who enters the DROP and
retires on the member's DROP retirement date is determined under
this Subsection E rather than under the provisions of Subsections A,
B, C or D of this section.
(2) Upon termination of employment, including, but not limited to, early
DROP termination with cause, early DROP termination without

cause, or disability, a member will receive the following retirement
benefit:
(a) The member's DROP account benefit, which is the member's
DROP account balance composed of a) an amount equal to
100% of the monthly retirement allowance the member would
have received if he or she had retired as of the date of entry into
the DROP and any applicable post-retirement allowance, and b)
an annual two-percent interest credit; plus
(b) The member's monthly retirement benefit, based on the basic
monthly retirement benefit, computed as of the date of entry
into the DROP.
(3) A member who enters DROP shall be fully vested at all times in the
member's DROP account balance.
F. Exit from plan. [Added 4-2-2018 by Ord. No. 1959]
(1) A member who enters the DROP established by this § 2-239 shall
exit the DROP at the earliest of:
(a) The member's DROP retirement date;
(b) Ninety-six months after the member's DROP entry date;
(c) The mandatory retirement age applicable to the member, if
any; or
(d) The date the member retires because of a disability as provided
under § 2-242.
(2) Upon the member's DROP exit for any reason, the member shall not
be entitled to receive additional compensation for any unused
holiday pay, sick time pay, or vacation pay accrued while in the
DROP.
G. If a member dies prior to the member's DROP exit, the member's
beneficiary shall be entitled to the member's DROP account benefit as of
the date of the member's death. This lump sum benefit shall be in
addition to any benefit provided under §§ 2-241 and 2-244 of the
Kalamazoo City Code. [Added 4-2-2018 by Ord. No. 1959]
A. Prior to the date of his or her retirement, but not thereafter, a member
may elect to receive his or her retirement allowance as a straight life
retirement allowance payable throughout his or her life, or may elect to
receive the actuarial equivalent, determined as of the date of his or her
retirement, of his or her straight life retirement allowance in a reduced
retirement allowance payable throughout his or her life, and nominate a
beneficiary, in accordance with the provisions of the options set forth
below. If a member does not elect an option prior to the date of his or her
§ 2-239 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-240
1:X-22
retirement, the member will be presumed to have elected to receive his
or her retirement allowance as a straight life retirement allowance. A
member electing or retirant receiving a straight life retirement allowance
may designate a beneficiary. If the retirant dies before the aggregate
amount of payments to him or her equals his or her accumulated
contributions, the remainder produced by subtracting said payments
from said contributions shall be paid to said beneficiary. If the beneficiary
survives the retirant but dies before receiving payment, that payment
shall be made to the beneficiary's estate. If the beneficiary does not so
survive or if there is none designated, the above remainder shall be paid
to the retirant's estate:
(1) Option A: Cash Refund Annuity. Under Option A, formerly Option 2, if
a retirant dies before he or she has received, in the annuity portions
of his or her reduced retirement allowance, an aggregate amount
equal to his or her accumulated contributions standing to his or her
credit at the time of his or her retirement, the difference between his
or her accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of
annuity payments received by him or her shall be paid to such
person or persons as he or she shall have nominated by written
designation duly executed and filed with the Board. If there is no
such designated person surviving the retirant, such difference, if
any, shall be paid to the retirant's estate; or
(2) Option B: 100% Survivor Allowance. Under Option B, formerly
Option 3, upon the death of a retirant, his or her reduced allowance
shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person or
persons having an insurable interest in his or her life, as he or she
shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed
with the Board prior to the date of his or her retirement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2002, if the
retirant's beneficiary is not his or her spouse, the survivor allowance
percentage shall be adjusted as required to satisfy the limit under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2(c), based on the
age differential between the retirant and the beneficiary.
(3) Option C: 50% Survivor Allowance.
(a) Under Option C, formerly Option 4, upon the death of a retirant,
one-half of his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be
continued throughout the life of and paid to such person, having
an insurable interest in his or her life, as he or she shall have
nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with
the Board prior to the date of his or her retirement.
(b) If a retirant who has elected Option B or Option C and his or her
beneficiary under this § 2-240 die before the aggregate amount
of payments under said option equals the retirant's
accumulated contributions, the remainder, produced by
subtracting said payments from said contributions, shall be paid
as follows: If the beneficiary survived the retirant, the
§ 2-240 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-240
1:X-23
remainder shall be paid to the beneficiary's estate. If the
beneficiary did not survive the retirant, the above remainder
shall be paid to the retirant's estate.
(4) Option D: ten-year (120 months) Certain and Life Retirement
Allowance. Under Option D, the retirant shall be paid a reduced
retirement allowance for life with the provision that if the retirant's
death occurs before 120 monthly payments have been made, the
full reduced retirement allowance shall continue to be paid for the
remainder of the 120 months to such person or persons having an
insurable interest in his or her life, and in such shares as the retirant
shall have designated in writing and filed with the Board.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Option D, effective
January 1, 2002, Option D will not be available if the retirant is older
than 92 when the benefit commences.
(5) Option E. Fifteen-year (180 months) Certain and Life Retirement
Allowance.
(a) Under Option E, the retirant shall be paid a reduced retirement
allowance for life with the provision that if the retirant's death
occurs before 180 monthly payments have been made, the full,
reduced retirement allowance shall continue to be paid for the
remainder of 180 months to such person or persons having an
insurable interest in his or her life, and in such shares as the
retirant shall have designated in writing and filed with the
Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Option E,
effective January 1, 2002, Option E will not be available if the
retirant is older than 84 when the benefit commences.
(b) Under Option D or Option E, if there is no designated person
surviving the retirant, the then-present value of the remaining
unpaid monthly payments shall be computed and paid to the
estate of the retirant. If a designated person survives the
retirant and dies before receiving all the installments payable
under the option plan, there shall be paid to the estate of such
person the then-present value of the remaining unpaid
installments which would otherwise have been paid to such
person.
(6) Option F. Under Option F, the retirement allowance shall be the
same as under Option B for both the retirant and the beneficiary,
except that:
(a) The retirement allowance shall be reduced by an additional
amount, as required by actuarial considerations, so that in the
event the retirant were to survive the beneficiary, the retirant
would then be able to receive a straight life retirement
allowance at no added cost to the system, based upon actuarial
equivalence; and
§ 2-240 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-240
1:X-24
(b) In the event that the beneficiary predeceases the retirant, the
retirant's retirement allowance becomes a straight life
retirement allowance.
(7) Option G. Under Option G, the retirement allowance shall be the
same as under Option C for both the retirant and the beneficiary,
except that:
(a) The retirement allowance shall be reduced by an additional
amount, as required by actuarial considerations, so that in the
event the retirant were to survive the beneficiary the retirant
would then be able to receive a straight life retirement
allowance at no added cost to the system, based upon actuarial
equivalence; and
(b) In the event that the beneficiary predeceases the retirant, the
retirant's retirement allowance becomes a straight life
retirement allowance.
B. For the purposes of § 2-240 of the Kalamazoo City Code, the term "upon
the death of the retirant" shall mean the first day of the month
immediately following the month in which the retirant died.
C. Minimum distribution requirements. General rules. Notwithstanding any
provision of the retirement system to the contrary, effective January 1,
2002, any distribution under the retirement system shall be made in
accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations established
thereunder as they are amended and shall comply with the following
rules:
(1) Time and manner of distribution. To the extent required by Code
Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
payment of the benefits of a member shall begin not later than the
required beginning date, which, for purposes of this section, means
April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar
year in which the member reaches age 70 1/2, or (ii) the calendar
year in which the member retires.
(a) Death of member before distributions begin.
[1] If the member dies before distributions begin, the
member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be
distributed, no later than as follows:
[a] If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole
designated beneficiary, then distributions to the
surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year
in which the member died, or by December 31 of the
calendar year in which the member would have
attained age 70 1/2, if later.
§ 2-240 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-240
1:X-25
[b] If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's
sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the
designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of
the calendar year immediately following the calendar
year in which the member died.
[c] If there is no designated beneficiary as of September
30 of the year following the year of the member's
death, the member's entire interest will be distributed
by December 31 of the calendar year containing the
fifth anniversary of the member's death.
[d] If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole
designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies
after the member but before distributions to the
surviving spouse begin, this Subsection C(1)(a), other
than Subsection C(1)(a)[1], will apply as if the surviving
spouse were the member.
[2] For purposes of this Subsection C(1)(a) and Subsection
C(5), distributions are considered to begin on the member's
required beginning date {or, if Subsection C(1)(a)[1][d]
applies, the date distributions are required to begin to the
surviving spouse under Subsection C(1)(a)}. If annuity
payments irrevocably commence to the member before the
member's required beginning date {or to the member's
surviving spouse before the date distributions are required
to begin to the surviving spouse under Subsection
C(1)(a)[1][a]}, the date distributions are considered to
begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(b) Form of distribution. No payment option may be selected by a
member unless the amounts payable to the member are
expected to be at least equal to the minimum distribution
required under Code Section 401(a)(9). The amounts payable
must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit
requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G).
(2) Determination of amount to be distributed each year.
(a) General annuity requirements. If the member's interest is paid
in the form of annuity distributions under the retirement
system, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following
requirements:
[1] Distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at
intervals not longer than one year;
[2] The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a
period certain not longer than the period described in
Subsection C(3) or (4); and
§ 2-240 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-240
1:X-26
[3] Once payments have begun over a period certain, the
period certain will not be changed even if the period certain
is shorter than the maximum permitted.
(b) Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date.
The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's
required beginning date {or, if the member dies before
distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin
under Subsection C(1)(a)[1][a] or [b]} is the payment that is
required for one payment interval. The second payment need
not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if
that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment
intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g.,
bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the
member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of
the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals
ending on or after the member's required beginning date.
(c) Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any
additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year
after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed
beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year in which such
amount accrues.
(3) Requirements for annuity distributions. If the member had begun
receiving periodic payments from the plan that were not annuitized,
the balance shall be paid to the beneficiary at least as rapidly as
under the payment option selected by the member. If the member
had begun receiving payments in the form of a pension or annuity,
the beneficiary shall be bound by all restrictions applicable to the
pension or annuity, and the form of payment selected thereunder,
and remaining payments, if any, shall be paid to the beneficiary in
the same manner.
(4) Requirements for minimum distributions where member dies before
date distributions begin.
(a) Member survived by designated beneficiary. If the member dies
before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and
there is a designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest
will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in
Subsection C(1)(a)[1][a] or [b], over the life of the designated
beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:
[1] Unless the annuity starting date is before the first
distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the
designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's
age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year

immediately following the calendar year of the member's
death; or
[2] If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution
calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated
beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of
the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains
the annuity starting date.
(b) No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date
distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of
September 30 of the year following the year of the member's
death, distribution of the member's entire interest will be
completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the
fifth anniversary of the member's death.
(c) Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving
spouse begin. If the member dies before the date distribution of
his or her interest begins, the member's surviving spouse is the
member's sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving
spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin,
this Subsection C(4) will apply as if the surviving spouse were
the member, except that the time by which distributions must
begin will be determined without regard to Subsection C(1).
(5) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this
Subsection C:
DESIGNATED BENEFICIARY — The individual who is designated as
the beneficiary under the retirement system and is the designated
beneficiary under Code Section 401(a)(9) and Treasury Regulation
Section 1-401(a)(9)-4.
DISTRIBUTION CALENDAR YEAR — A calendar year for which a
minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before
the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the
calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which
contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions
beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar
year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin
pursuant to Subsection C(1)(a).
LIFE EXPECTANCY — Life expectancy as computed by use of the
Single Life Table in Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-9. This
definition of "life expectancy" shall apply only for purposes of
calculating minimum required distributions under Code Section
401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and shall not
apply for purposes of calculating any pension or any benefit
assigned under an EDRO otherwise payable under the retirement
system.

A. Any member who has acquired the minimum number of years of
credited service to satisfy the voluntary retirement age requirement,
may, at any time prior to the date of his or her retirement, elect Option B
provided in § 2-240, and nominate a beneficiary whom the Board finds to
be dependent upon the member for at least 50% of his or her financial
support. Prior to the date of his or her retirement, a member may revoke
his or her election of Option B and nomination of beneficiary and, prior to
the date of his or her retirement, he or she may again elect Option B and
nominate a beneficiary as provided in this subsection. Upon the death of
a member who has an Option B election in force, his or her beneficiary, if
living, shall immediately receive a retirement allowance, which is the
actuarial equivalent of a straight life retirement allowance computed
according to § 2-236, in the case of a Public Safety member, or according
to § 2-237, exclusive of Subsection B, in the case of a general member,
computed in the same manner in all respects as if the member had
retired the day preceding the date of his or her death, notwithstanding
that he or she might not have attained his or her voluntary retirement
age. If a member has an Option B election in force at the time of his or
her retirement, his or her election of Option B and nomination of
beneficiary shall thereafter continue in force unless, prior to the date of
his or her retirement, he or she elects a straight life retirement allowance
or another option provided in § 2-240. No retirement allowance shall be
paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member if any
benefits are paid or are to be payable under § 2-241B or 2-244 on
account of his or her death. [Amended 10-4-2010 by Ord. No. 1874]
B. Any member who has acquired the minimum number of years of
credited service to satisfy the voluntary age requirement, but does not
have an Option B election provided in Subsection A of this section in
force, and dies while in the employ of the City and leaves a spouse, the
spouse shall immediately receive a retirement allowance computed
according to § 2-237, exclusive of Subsection B, in the same manner and
all respects as if the member had retired the day preceding the date of
his or her death, notwithstanding that he or she might not have attained
his or her voluntary retirement age, elected Option B provided in § 2-240
and nominated his or her spouse as beneficiary. No retirement allowance
shall be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member,
if any benefits are paid or are to be payable under §§ 2-241A and 2-244
on account of his or her death. [Amended 10-4-2010 by Ord. No.
1874]
C. If any Public Safety member continues in the employ of the City on or
after the date he or she acquires 10 years of credited service, and does
not have an Option B election provided in Subsection A of this section in
force, and dies while in the employ of the City, the applicable benefits
provided in Subsection C(1), (2) and (3) shall be paid:
(1) The accumulated contributions standing to the member's credit in
the annuity savings fund at the time of his or her death shall be paid
in accordance with the provisions of § 2-247.

§ 2-242. Disability retirement.
(2) The surviving spouse of the deceased person shall receive a pension
of 33 1/3% of his or her final compensation. A surviving spouse's
pension shall terminate upon his or her remarriage or death, and
shall be subject to § 2-245 and to Subsection B of this section.
(3) If the deceased person leaves an unmarried child or children under
age 18 years, 15% of the final compensation shall be paid for one
child or 25% of the final compensation for two or more children.
Upon a child's adoption, marriage, death or attainment of age 18
years, whichever occurs first, his or her pension shall terminate and
the Board shall recalculate and make payment of the deceased
person's final compensation to his remaining eligible children under
18 years of age, if any, in the percentages set forth in this section.
Any pension payable under this subsection shall be subject to
§ 2-245.
D. If a beneficiary elects to take benefits under § 2-240 or 2-241A, then no
benefits shall be paid under § 2-241C on account of his or her death.
A. A member who has acquired the minimum number of years of credited
service to satisfy the voluntary retirement age requirement and
becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the employ of
the City may be retired by the Board upon application of the member or
his/her department head, provided that, after medical examination of
the member made or by under the direction of the medical director, the
medical director certifies to the Board that the member is mentally or
physically totally incapacitated for duty in the employ of the City, will
probably be permanently incapacitated and should be retired. Upon his
retirement, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance
provided in § 2-243. [Amended 10-4-2010 by Ord. No. 1874]
(1) A decision by the Board to grant either a duty or non-duty disability
retirement to any employee, including Public Safety officers, shall be
a final decision on that employee's fitness to work. A decision by the
Board to retire any employee, including a Public Safety officer, for
reasons of disability shall completely terminate that individual's
right to continue to work for the City, and shall be effective
immediately, regardless of whether that individual subsequently
remains on the payroll or is otherwise compensated by the City after
the date of the Board's decision by virtue of accumulated sick pay,
vacation pay, worker's compensation, or any other type of payment
of wages, salary or any other type of compensation.
B. A member need not have acquired the minimum number of years of
credited service to satisfy the voluntary retirement age requirement if
the Board finds the member to be totally and permanently disabled for
duty in the employ of the City as the natural and proximate result of the
personal injury or disease arising out of and in the course of his/her City
employment. [Amended 10-4-2010 by Ord. No. 1874]
§ 2-241 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-242
1:X-30
C. Beginning January 1, 1984, if a Public Safety member is totally
incapacitated for duty as a police officer, fire fighter or Public Safety
officer and the Board finds that his or her disability is the natural and
proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of his or her
employment as a police officer or fire fighter with the City and that the
employee will likely be permanently so incapacitated, the member shall
be entitled to a duty disability retirement allowance calculated in the
same manner as a voluntary retirement benefit, except that, during the
member's worker's compensation period, his or her duty disability
retirement allowance under this subsection shall not exceed the
difference between his or her final compensation and his or her weekly
worker's compensation award converted to an annual basis.
(1) If the member disagrees with the finding of the medical director, he
or she shall have the right to submit reports from his or her medical
doctor. In the event a dispute continues to exist, the medical
director and the member's doctor shall select a third doctor who
shall provide the Board with an opinion concerning the disputed
matters before the Board renders its decision.
(2) If a dispute continues to exist concerning the meaning or application
of the retirement system after a decision by the Board, such dispute
shall not be grievable under labor agreements, but subject to
review, as provided by applicable law, in the Kalamazoo County
Circuit Court or other court as may be appropriate.
(3) The Public Safety member may elect to waive the provisions of the
duty disability retirement he or she is entitled to and accept such
retraining, rehabilitation and/or other employment as the City may
choose to offer. The Public Safety member shall retain any benefits
he or she has earned in the police/fire portion of the retirement
system.
D. The Board of Trustees shall have the right and opportunity to have a
medical examination conducted of the person whose injury or sickness is
the basis of a disability benefit during the pendency of a claim or period
of payment, subject to the following:
(1) Examination may be made no more often than once during every
twelve-month period, except that the Board may require
examination at any time there is specific reason to believe that the
disability or condition giving rise thereto no longer exists;
(2) The examination shall be limited to the condition upon which the
disability is based.
(3) The expense of the examination and all other reasonable incidental
costs, such as travel, meals and lodging at standard rates for City
employee travel, will be borne by the retirement system under
§ 2-251 of the Kalamazoo City Code.
§ 2-242 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-242
1:X-31
§ 2-243. Disability retirement allowance (duty and non-duty).
(4) If the Board at any time believes that the facts of the case do not
require further examination, the Board may waive examination for
any time the Board deems appropriate based upon the facts of the
case, but such waiver may be rescinded by the Board at any time.
(5) Notification of the time, date and place of the examination shall be
mailed to the retirant at the address to which his or her benefits are
mailed, and said notice shall be mailed at least 30 days prior to the
date of the examination.
E. If the retirant fails or refuses examination, or if upon reviewing the
medical information received, the Board is not satisfied that the
disability still exists, the Board shall so inform the retirant. If, within 30
days of such notice being sent, the retirant has not requested a hearing
on the mailer, the Board may terminate the disability benefits. The
termination of benefits under this section shall not affect eligibility for
nondisability benefits. If a hearing is timely requested, the retirant shall
be permitted to present evidence, question witnesses, and make
argument for nontermination. The Board may obtain and consider any
relevant evidence. If it finds that the disability no longer exists, benefits
shall be terminated. The time, date, and place of the hearing shall be set
by the Board. Notices shall be to the retirant at the address to which his
or her benefits are sent.
A. If a member retires on account of his or her total and permanent
disability, as provided in § 2-242, and the Board finds that his or her
disability did not occur as the result of causes arising out of and in the
course of his or her actual performance of duty in the employ of the City,
he or she shall receive a disability retirement allowance computed
according to § 2-236, if he or she is a Public Safety member, or according
to § 2-237, exclusive of Subsection B, if he or she is a general member.
His or her disability retirement allowance shall be subject to §§ 2-245 and
2-246. Prior to the date of his or her retirement, he or she shall have the
right to elect to receive his or her retirement allowance under an option
provided in § 2-240 in lieu of a straight life retirement allowance.
B. If a member retires before his or her voluntary retirement age on
account of his or her total and permanent disability, as provided in
§ 2-242, and the Board finds that his or her disability is the natural and
proximate result of cause arising out of and in the course of his or her
actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, he or she shall
receive a disability retirement allowance computed according to § 2-236,
if he or she is a Public Safety member or according to § 2-237, exclusive
of Subsection B, if he or she is a general member. In computing his or her
disability retirement allowance, the credited service to be used shall be
the sum of his or her credited service in force at the time of his or her
retirement and the number of years, and fraction of a year, in the period
from the date of his or her retirement to the date he or she would attain
his voluntary retirement age had he or she continued in City

employment. During his or her worker's compensation period, his or her
disability retirement allowance shall not exceed the difference between
his or her final compensation and his or her weekly worker's
compensation award converted to an annual basis. His or her disability
retirement allowance shall be subject to § 2-246. Prior to the date of his
or her retirement, he or she shall have the right to elect to receive his or
her retirement allowance under an option provided in § 2-240 in lieu of a
straight life retirement allowance.
A. In the event a member dies as the result of a personal injury or disease
arising solely out of and in the course of his or her employment by the
City, or a disability retirant dies within a period of five years from and
after the effective date of his or her retirement, and prior to attainment
of age 60 years, as the result of the same injury or disease for which he
or she was retired, and in either case such death, injury or disease
resulting in death is found by the Board to have been the result of his or
her actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, the applicable
benefits provided in Subsection A(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this
subsection shall be paid.
(1) The accumulated contributions standing to the member's credit in
the annuity savings fund at the time of his or her death shall be paid
in accordance with the provisions of § 2-247; or
(2) The surviving spouse of the deceased person shall receive a pension
of 33 1/3% of his or her final compensation, provided that, in the
case of a disability retirant, he or she was the spouse of the member
at the time of the member's retirement. A surviving spouse's
pension shall terminate upon his or her remarriage or death, and
shall be subject to § 2-245 and to Subsection B of this section; and
(3) If, in addition to a surviving spouse, the deceased person leaves an
unmarried child or children under age 18 years, each such child
shall receive a pension of an equal share of 25% of his or her final
compensation. Upon a child's adoption, marriage, death or
attainment of age 18 years, whichever occurs first, his or her
pension shall terminate and the Board shall redistribute the shares
of 25% of the deceased person's final compensation to his or her
remaining eligible children under age 18 years. Any pension payable
under this subsection shall be subject to § 2-245 and to Subsection B
of this section; but
(4) If there is no spouse surviving the deceased person, or if his or her
surviving spouse dies or remarries before his or her youngest
unmarried child attains age 18 years, his or her unmarried child or
children under age 18 years shall each receive a pension of 25% of
his or her final compensation; provided that, if there are more than
two such surviving children, each such child shall receive a pension
of an equal share of 50% of his or her final compensation. Upon a

of such person against such third party to the extent of the benefits which
the City pays or becomes liable to pay.
§ 2-246. Return of disability retirant to City employ; payment
proportional to available funds.
A disability retirant who has been or who shall be returned to the employ of
the City shall again become a member of the retirement system. His or her
credited service in force at the time of his or her retirement shall be restored
to his or her credit. He or she shall be given service credit for the period he
or she was receiving a disability retirement allowance if, within such period,
he or she was in receipt of worker's compensation on account of his or her
total and permanent disability arising out of and in the course of his or her
City employment; otherwise, he or she shall not be given the service credit
for the period he or she was in receipt of a disability retirement allowance.

whichever occurs first, his or her pension shall terminate and the
Board shall redistribute the shares of 50% of the deceased person's
final compensation to his or her remaining eligible children under
age 18 years. In no case shall any such child's pension exceed 25%
of the deceased person's final compensation. Any pension payable
under this subsection shall be subject to § 2-245 and to Subsection
B of this section; or
(5) If there is neither a surviving spouse nor children eligible to receive
a pension provided in this section surviving the deceased person,
there shall be paid to each his or her dependent father and
dependent mother, whom the Board, after investigation, finds to
have been actually dependent upon the deceased person for
financial support, a pension of 16 2/3% of his or her final
compensation. Any pension payable under this subsection shall be
subject to § 2-245 and to Subsection B of this section, and shall in no
case exceed $720 a year.
B. If a beneficiary becomes entitled to a retirement allowance provided in
§ 2-240 or 2-241 on account of the death of a retirant or member, and he
or she elects to take under § 2-240 or 2-241, then no benefits shall be
paid under this section on account of his or her death. Any pension due
any child under Subsection A of this section may, in the discretion of the
Board, be paid to the parent or person who stands in loco parentis to
such child; provided that, if the Board finds that such child is not being
properly cared for, the Board may require the appointment of a guardian
for the purpose of receiving such pension.

§ 2-246.5. Periodic payment.
A. Commencing in the year 2001, and thereafter occurring every third year,
subject to the limitations set forth below, a nonguaranteed payment
shall be paid from the system assets to certain retirees; for each such
person, the amount to be paid shall be the product of $43.67 (subject to
the increases allowed below) times the sum of the retiree's years and
fraction thereof of credited service plus the number of years and fraction
thereof which have elapsed between the retirant's date of retirement
and December 31 of the year preceding the payment to be made.
B. Eligibility. [Amended 4-21-2008 by Ord. No. 1838]
(1) The retirees eligible to receive said periodic payment shall be those
who:
(a) Retired prior to January 1, 2000; and
(b) Have been retired at least five years prior to December 31 of
the year preceding the periodic payment to be made; and
(c) Have attained the age of 70 years prior to June 1 of the year
preceding the periodic payment to be made; and
(d) Had at least 25 years of service with the City of Kalamazoo; and
(e) Whose annual retirement allowance is less than $20,000, but
who are not eligible for a post-retirement adjustment.
(2) In those instances where a retirement allowance is divided by an
EDRO, the "retired prior to" language above applies to the actual
retiree, not the alternate payee; the "less than $20,000"
requirement shall apply to the combined amounts being received by
the retiree and the alternate payee.
C. If the periodic payment provided for above, when added to the existing
retirement allowance, exceeds $20,000, the periodic payment shall be
reduced by the amount said sum exceeds $20,000. In those instances
where a retirement allowance is divided by an EDRO, if the periodic
payment(s), when added to the existing retirement allowances, exceed
$20,000, the periodic payment(s) shall be reduced by the amount said
sum exceeds $20,000. [Amended 4-21-2008 by Ord. No. 1838]
D. A beneficiary currently receiving a retirement allowance, or an individual
who in the future becomes a beneficiary and who thereafter receives
such an allowance, shall be entitled to receive the periodic payment
based upon the same calculations (that is, the beneficiary's retirant's
years of credited service and years since retirement) and subject to the
same limitations, as described herein.
§ 2-246.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-246.5
1:X-35
§ 2-247. Refund of accumulated contributions.
E. In computing future retirement allowance payments, or any other
payment due to a retirant or beneficiary, the payments provided herein
shall not be considered.
F. The periodic payment described herein shall be made in June every third
year, commencing 2001; however, no payment shall be made in any
year in which the fund's actuary projects (based upon a valuation of the
fund as of December 31 of the prior year) the need for City contributions
to the fund (for one or more actuarial grouping) within 10 years of the
projection nor if the actuary recommends a contribution by the City (for
one or more actuarial grouping) for that year. In the event a periodic
payment is not made in a year in which it would otherwise occur
(because of the actuary's projection or recommendation), then the
payment shall be made in the next year in which no such actuarial
projection or recommendation is made. In the event that a periodic
payment is so delayed, future periodic payments shall be made every
third year thereafter (so long as not prohibited by an actuarial projection
or recommendation).
G. When calculating the amount of the periodic payment for each individual
after 2001, the $43.67 amount referenced above shall increase by the
lesser of 2% per year or the C.P.I. (i.e., the Consumer Price Index, U.S.
City Average, all urban consumers) which exists for the period of time
between December 31 of the year preceding the last payment and
December 31 of the year preceding the payment to be made.
H. In no event, however, shall the total of all of the periodic payments in
one year exceed the amount of $750,000; in the event the total
payments are in excess of that amount, each individual's payment shall
be reduced proportionately to reduce the total payment to said
$750,000. Any periodic payment due to a retiree who is alive on
December 31 of the year prior to the payment, but who dies before the
payment is made, shall be made (one time only) to that retiree's estate
or beneficiary, as the case may be.
I. Notwithstanding any of the above, the City administration shall be
entitled to recommend to the City Commission at any time that the
periodic payments be reduced or eliminated, and the City Commission
shall, at any time, be entitled, with or without such a recommendation,
to reduce or eliminate said periodic payments.
A. Should any member cease to be employed by the City before he or she
attains his voluntary retirement age, for any reason except his or her
retirement or death, he shall be paid his accumulated contributions
standing to his or her credit in the annuity savings funds, as he or she
shall demand in writing on forms furnished by the Board.
B. Should a member die and no retirement allowance or pension will
become payable by the retirement system on account of his or her

contributions standing to his or her credit in the annuity savings fund at

or she shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and
filed with the Board. If there is no such designated person surviving the
member, his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid to his or her
legal representative.
C. If a member dies without heirs, and without a designated beneficiary
surviving him or her, accumulated contributions standing to his or her
credit in the annuity savings fund at the time of his or her death may be
used to pay his or her burial expenses, not to exceed a reasonable sum
to be determined by the Board, provided he or she leaves no other
estate sufficient for such purpose.
D. Payments of accumulated contributions, as provided in this section, may
be made in installments according to such rules and regulations as the
Board may from time to time adopt.
E. Code Section 401(a)(31), Direct rollovers. Notwithstanding any provision
of the plan to the contrary, for distributions made on or after January 1,
1993, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed
by the Board of Trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee in a direct rollover.
A. The annuity savings fund is hereby created. It shall be the fund in which
shall be accumulated at regular interest, the contributions deducted
from the compensation of members (or "picked up" by the City pursuant
to Subsection F to provide for their annuities, and from which shall be
made refunds and transfers of accumulated contributions as provided in
this article.
B. Each member shall contribute a percentage of his or her annual
compensation to the annuity fund, which percentage shall be as follows:
(1) For Public Safety members, 8% throughout 1998, 7 1/4% throughout
1999, and 6 1/2% on and after January 1, 2000, except that on and
after January 1, 1999, those Public Safety members who are
members of the Kalamazoo Police Supervisors' Association with at
least 26 years but fewer than 29 years of credited service need
make no contributions.
(2) For members represented by the Kalamazoo Municipal Employees
Association, 3%, except that on and after March 13, 2000, the

after January 12, 2007, it shall be 1%.
(5) For a member who is represented by the AFSCME effective October
2, 2006, 1%, but that will increase to 2% if the funding level of the
pension fund drops below 120%.

members hired on or after June 1, 2006, it shall be 3%; and except
for those exempt members who pay an additional 2% pursuant to

C. The officer or officers responsible for making the payroll shall cause the
applicable contribution provided for in Subsection B of this section to be
deducted from the compensation of each member (or "picked up" by the
City pursuant to Subsection F with respect to each and every payroll, for
each and every payroll period, so long as he or she remains a member in
the employ of the City. Such contribution, when thus deducted or "picked
up," shall be paid to the retirement system and shall be credited to his or
her individual account in the annuity savings fund. Every member shall
be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions or salary reductions
made and provided for herein. Payment of his or her compensation, less
such deductions or reductions, shall be a full and complete discharge
and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for services
rendered by him or her during the period covered by such payment,
except as to benefits provided under this article. The member's
contributions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the
minimum compensation provided by law for any member shall be
thereby changed.
D. In addition to the contributions deducted from the compensation of a
member, as hereinbefore provided, he or she shall deposit in the annuity
savings fund, by a single contribution or by an increased rate of
contribution, as approved by the Board, the amount, if any, he or she
withdrew from the annuity savings fund, together with regular interest
from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. In no case shall
any member be given credit for service rendered prior to the date he or
she withdrew his or her accumulated contributions until he or she repays
the annuity savings fund all amounts due the fund by him or her.
E. Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated contributions
shall be transferred from the annuity savings fund to the retirement
reserve fund. At the expiration of a period of three years from the date
an employee ceases to be a member, any balance standing to his or her
credit in the annuity savings fund, unclaimed by the member or his or
her legal representative, shall remain a part of the monies of the

§ 2-249. Retirement reserve fund.
The retirement reserve fund is hereby created. It shall be the fund from
which shall be paid all annuities and pensions payable as provided in this
article. Should a disability retirant return to the employ of the City, his
annuity reserve at the date of his or her return shall be transferred from the
retirement reserve fund to the annuity savings fund and shall be credited to
his or her individual account therein; and his or her pension reserve shall be
transferred to the pension reserve fund.

retirement allowance payable by the retirement system.
F. The City Commission may, from time to time by resolution, designate
one or more classes, groups or categories of City employees who shall
have their employee contributions "picked up" as hereinafter described,
provided that:
(1) The City Commission may, by appropriate resolution, likewise
withdraw such designation from one or more classes, groups or
categories of City employees.
(2) All designations or withdrawals of designations shall be done so as
not to discriminate in favor of employees who are officers or highly
compensated individuals, within the meaning of Section 401(a)(4) of
the Internal Revenue Code.
(a) Effective as provided in the following subsection, the
contributions, required by Subsection B in respect of those
employees who are included within a class, group or category
so designated by the City Commission, shall be "picked up" by
the City in lieu of their employee contributions, as permitted by
Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, and shall be
treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment
under said Code. The City shall "pick up" these employee
contributions from funds made available as a result of each
such employee's authorization to reduce his or her salary or
wages in an amount corresponding to the contribution required
by Subsection B. Employee contributions "picked up" by the
City pursuant to this subsection shall be treated for all other
purposes in the same manner and to the same extent as
employee contributions made prior to the effective date of this
subsection. No employee in any such class, category or group
shall have the option of choosing to receive contributed
amounts directly, instead of having them paid by the City to the
retirement system.
A. The reserve for employer contributions shall be the account to which
shall be credited contributions made by the City to the retirement

investment income.
§ 2-252. (Reserved)
§ 2-252.1. Investment Committee and management of Trust Fund.
There is hereby created an Investment Committee which shall manage the
assets of the system and have full power to invest and reinvest such assets,
subject to the provisions of Act 314 of the Public Acts of 1965 (MCLA
§ 38.1132 et seq.), as amended, and any other applicable law or regulation.
The Committee shall have the power to purchase notes, bonds, or other
obligations of the City before or after the same are offered to the public
and with or without advertising for bids. The Committee shall have power
to hold, purchase, sell, assign, transfer, and dispose of any securities and
investments in which any of the funds of the retirement system have been
system and from which shall be made transfers as provided in this
section.
B. Each year following receipt of the report of the annual actuarial
valuation, the excess, if any, of the reported value of retirement
allowance being paid and likely to be paid retirants and beneficiaries
over the balance in the reserve for retired benefit payments shall be
transferred from the reserve for employer contributions to the reserve
for retired benefit payments.
C. The financial objective of this section is to require City contributions to
the retirement system each fiscal year which, together with the
contributions made by members during the fiscal year, shall be sufficient
to (i) fully fund the cost of benefits likely to be paid on account of service
rendered by members during the year, and (ii) finance unfunded costs of
benefits likely to be paid on account of service rendered by members
prior to the current year over a period of not more than 40 years. Such
contributions shall be computed by the actuary as level percentages of
member payroll in accordance with generally accepted actuarial
principles on the basis of such rates of interest and tables of experience
as the Investment Committee recommends and the City Commission
shall from time to time adopt. The City may also contribute the
anticipated cost of any insurance coverage provided retirants and
beneficiaries through the retirement system. The Investment Committee
shall annually certify to the Commission the contributions determined
according to this section.
D. Forfeited amounts, if any, resulting from the operation of the retirement
system shall be applied to reduce the next succeeding contribution or
contributions required to be made to the reserve by the City under this
section and shall not be applied to increase any pensions and/or
annuities payable to any member under the retirement system.

belonging to the system. The provisions of this section shall be subject to
such conditions and restrictions as the City Commission may from time to
time impose by resolution.
§ 2-252.2. Investment Committee membership, appointment and
duties.
A. Membership, appointment.
(1) The Investment Committee shall be composed of no fewer than
three members nor more than seven members, all of whom shall
have a financial background and none of whom shall be participants
in the system. Additionally, to avoid a conflict of interest, or the
appearance thereof, no member shall be employed by or associated
with (except in the capacity of outside director) any organization
that provides services similar to those retained or used by the
Committee. One member may be a member of the Board of Trustees
of the system.
(2) The Investment Committee members shall serve without
compensation, and if any member fails to attend three consecutive
regularly scheduled meetings of the Committee, unless in each case
excused for cause by the remaining members, his or her office will
be deemed vacated. Within 60 days of any time that the number of
Committee members becomes fewer than three, the Mayor, with the
consent of the City Commission, shall appoint enough new members
so that the Committee consists of three members. At any time the
Committee consists of fewer than seven members but more than
two members, and a majority of the Committee desires the addition
of one or more new members, the Mayor, with the consent of the
City Commission, shall appoint new members in such number as
requested by the then-existing Committee. All members shall serve
three-year terms, with the exception of those who are appointed to
replace those with unexpired portions of their terms; said
replacement members shall serve the unexpired portion of the term,
in the same manner as the office was previously filled.
(3) The Committee shall hold meetings regularly, at least quarterly, and
shall designate the time and place thereof. A majority of the
Committee's membership shall constitute a quorum at any meeting
of the Committee. Each member shall be entitled to one vote on
each question before the Committee; at any meeting with a quorum,
decisions shall be made by affirmative vote of a majority of those
present; except that should the Committee's membership become
three, the entire membership shall constitute a quorum and all
decisions shall be made by a unanimous vote of the entire
membership. The Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure
and shall keep a record of its proceedings. All meetings of the
Committee shall be open to the public. The City Commission may
appoint a Commissioner as liaison to the Committee.

§ 2-252.3. Available cash and use of assets.
There shall be kept on deposit available cash not to exceed 5% of the
total assets of the retirement system. The trust fund shall be held for
the sole purpose of meeting disbursements for pensions, annuities and
other payments authorized by this article and shall be used for no other
purpose. It shall not be possible, at any time prior to satisfaction of all
B. Officers.
(1) The Committee shall elect a chairperson and chairperson pro tem.
(2) The Director of Finance shall serve as secretary to the Committee
and provide staff support.
(3) The City Attorney shall be the legal advisor to the Committee.

(1) To formulate and recommend to the City Commission investment
policies, strategies, and guidelines for approval by the City
Commission.
(2) To carry out such investment policies, strategies, and guidelines as
approved by the City Commission.
(3) To establish investment performance monitoring systems and report
the results of said system quarterly to the City Commission.
(4) To investigate and recommend investment managers, advisors,
actuaries, and other necessary services to the City Commission for
its approval.
(5) To recommend to the City Commission for approval the allocation of
annual contributions and redistribution of funds, including
investment income, to investment managers, reserves and
accounts.
(6) To ensure that investment records are properly maintained.
(7) To serve as the primary contact with investment managers,
actuaries and advisors.
(8) To ensure that the plan is properly audited.
(9) To provide the actuary with data to make the annual valuation,
which shall show the financial condition of the system by means of
an actuarial valuation of its assets and liabilities and be rendered
annually to the City Commission.
(10) To recommend actuarial assumptions to the City Commission.

to time direct.

liabilities to members and their beneficiaries under the retirement system,
for any part of said assets to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other
than for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries and for
paying reasonable expenses of the retirement system and the trust fund. The
description of the various funds of the retirement system, as contained in this
article, shall be interpreted to refer to the accounting records of the system.
§ 2-253. Method of making payments.
All payments from monies of the retirement system shall be made according
to Charter and ordinance provisions. No check shall be issued unless it
shall have been previously authorized by a specific or continuing resolution
adopted by the Board or Investment Committee.
§ 2-254. Income fund; allowance of regular interest.
A. The income fund is hereby created. It shall be the fund to which shall be
credited all interest, dividends and other income from investments of the
retirement system; all gifts and bequests received by the system; all
unclaimed accumulated contributions as provided in this article; and all
other monies received by the system, the disposition of which is not
specifically provided in this article. There shall be paid or transferred
from the income fund all amounts required to credit regular interest to
the annuity savings fund, retirement reserve fund and the pension
reserve fund, as provided in this article. Wherever the Investment
Committee determines the balance in the income fund is more than
sufficient to cover current charges to the fund, such excess amount, or
any part thereof, may be used to provide contingency reserves or to
meet special requirements of the other funds of the system, except the
expense fund, as the Investment Committee shall determine. However,
any amounts left in the income fund after meeting the requirements
contained herein shall at the end of each year be automatically credited
to the employer's reserve. Whenever the balance in the income fund is
insufficient to meet the charges to the fund, the amount of such
insufficiency shall be transferred from the pension reserve fund to the
income fund.
B. The Investment Committee shall, at the end of each fiscal year, allow
regular interest on the members' individual balances in the annuity
savings fund at the beginning of the fiscal year, and on the mean
balances in the retirement reserve fund and the pension reserve fund.
The amounts of interest so allowed and credited shall be charged to the
income fund.
C. The Investment Committee may, unless restricted by law, transfer
assets of the income fund to a collective or common group trust, as
permitted under Revenue Ruling 81-100 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1 (or
subsequent guidance), that is operated or maintained exclusively for the
commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the
funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under

§ 2-255. Previous assets credited to retirement system.
All assets held as of the effective date of Ordinance No. 378 for the purpose
of financing the retirement system established by Ordinance No. 188 shall be
credited to the retirement system as amended by Ordinance No. 378. Such
credits shall be made as follows:
§ 2-256. Benefits assumed.
The retirement benefits allowed under Ordinance No. 188 prior to the
effective date of Ordinance No. 378 shall be continued without adjustment
of amounts. The 1966 amendments of Ordinance No. 378, as amended, shall
not apply to pensions and retirement allowances being paid as of the day
preceding the effective date of the 1966 amendments.

individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e)
of the Internal Revenue Code, eligible governmental plans that meet
the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
government plans under Section 401(a)(24) of the Internal Revenue
Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account that is
treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of valuation, the value of
the interest maintained by the system in such group trust shall be
the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the
system, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation
procedures. The Investment Committee may adopt one or more group
trust(s) as part of the system, by executing appropriate participation
and/or adoption agreements with the group trust's trustee. [Added

A. Assets credited to the prior service pension fund and all other assets
held for the purpose of financing prior service pensions shall be credited
to the pension reserve fund.
B. Assets credited to the retirement annuity and pension fund arising from
City contributions shall be credited to the pension reserve fund.
C. Assets credited to the individual accounts of members in the retirement
annuity and pension fund arising from their contributions, together with
regular interest credited thereon, shall be credited to their individual
accounts in the annuity savings fund.
D. Assets credited to the retirement annuity and pension fund held for the
purpose of paying annuities and pensions to individuals who have retired
shall be credited to the retirement reserve fund.
E. All other assets held for the purpose of financing the retirement system
established by Ordinance No. 188, not accounted for above, shall be
credited to the pension reserve fund.

§ 2-257. Correction of errors.
Should any change in the records result in any person receiving from the
retirement system more or less than he or she would have been entitled
to receive had the records been correct, the Board shall correct such error
and, as far as is practicable, shall adjust the payment in such manner that
the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such person was correctly
entitled shall be paid.

assignment; City's right of setoff; forfeiture of retirement

§ 2-259. Protection against fraud.
Whoever, with intent to deceive, shall make any statement or report required
under this article which is untrue, or shall falsify or permit to be falsified
any record or records of the retirement system, or who shall otherwise
violate, with intent to deceive, any provision of this article shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and punishable as provided in § 1-7 of this Code.
§ 2-260. Retirant's death benefit.
Upon the death of any retirant, the retirement system shall pay to the
person previously designated by the retirant, or if none to the estate of the
deceased, the sum of $1,000.
A. The right of a person to an annuity, a pension, a retirement allowance, to
the return of accumulated contributions, the annuity, the pension, or the
retirement allowance itself, any optional benefits, any other right
accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article,
and any moneys belonging to the retirement system, shall not be subject
to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or
insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever, and shall be
unassignable except as is specifically provided in this article. If a
member is covered by a group insurance or prepayment plan
participated in by the City, and should he be permitted to, and elect to,
continue such coverage as a retirant, he or she may authorize the Board
to have deducted from his or her retirement allowance the payments
required of him or her to continue coverage under such group insurance
or prepayment plan. The City shall have the right of setoff for any claim
arising from embezzlement by or fraud of a member, retirant or
beneficiary.
B. The City shall comply with a court order directing that all or a portion of a
member's pension rights be forfeited, pursuant to the Public Employee
Retirement Benefits Forfeiture Act, MCLA § 38.2701 et seq.

§ 2-261. Reciprocal Retirement Act.
This City, being a "municipal unit" which covers its employees under a
retirement system, does hereby, by a majority vote of its governing body,
elect to adopt the provisions of the Reciprocal Retirement Act, No. 88 of
1961 (MSA § 4.1601; MCLA § 38.1101) for its employees covered under such
retirement system. The City Clerk shall file written certification of this action
with the Secretary of State for the State of Michigan.
§ 2-262. Description of funds; effect.
The description of various funds of the retirement system shall be interpreted
to refer to the accounting records of the retirement system and not to the
segregation of monies in the various funds of the system.
§ 2-263. Maximum retirement allowances.
Maximum retirement allowances. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the retirement system to the contrary, the maximum annual retirement
allowance derived from City contributions to the system, payable on a
straight life basis in respect to a member, at the time of retirement shall not
exceed the lesser of:
A. Effective January 1, 2002, the dollar amount established in Code Section
415(b)(1)(A), which is adjusted for inflation based on Section 215(i)(2)(A)
of the Social Security Act; or
B. One hundred percent of the member's average compensation from the
City during the three consecutive calendar years during which he or she
was an active member and had the greatest aggregate compensation
from the City, except that for those persons who are members on or
before March 1, 1999, and who are then, or thereafter become, exempt
members and who retire on or after January 1, 1999, the percentage
shall be 92%; and further except that for those persons who first become
members after March 1, 1999, and who then or thereafter become
exempt employees, the percentage shall be 70%; provided, however,
that:
(1) If retirement allowances are payable in any form other than on a
straight life basis, the determinations as to whether the foregoing
limitation has been satisfied shall be made in accordance with
applicable treasury regulations by adjusting such retirement
allowances so they are equivalent to retirement allowances payable
on a straight life basis.
(2) If the member has less than 10 years of credited service, the
maximum annual retirement allowance payable on a straight life
basis in respect of a member shall be the applicable maximum
annual amount described above multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years of his or her credited
service and the denominator of which is 10.

§ 2-263.1. Eligible domestic relations orders.
An eligible domestic relations order ("EDRO") is a signed domestic relations
order issued by a state court which assigns to an alternate payee(s) the right
to receive all or part of a member's retirement system benefit that is or
will become payable to the member. An alternate payee is a spouse, former
spouse, child or other dependent of a member who is treated as a beneficiary
under the retirement system as a result of the EDRO. The Board of Trustees
may establish EDRO procedures, but in the absence of such procedures, the
Board will determine if a domestic relations order is an EDRO in accordance
with the following:
(3) For purposes of this section, there shall not be taken into account
any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement
income benefits, nor any other benefit not required by Section
415(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, to be taken
into account for purposes of the limitation on retirement allowances
described in this section.
(4) If a member should become a member in, or become entitled to
benefits under, another tax-qualified pension, profit-sharing or
savings plan of the City, the Board of Trustees may reduce the
retirement allowance payable in respect of such member under this
retirement system to the extent necessary to prevent
disqualification of this retirement system. In such event, the Board
of Trustees shall notify the member of such reduction and furnish
him or her with an explanation of the same.
(5) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, a member's
average compensation shall take into account the annual limit on
compensation under Code Section 401(a)(17) for each of the
member's three calendar years of compensation used in
determining such average compensation.
A. Board of Trustees' determination. Promptly upon the receipt of a
domestic relations order, the Board will notify the member and any
alternate payee named in the order of such receipt and will include a
copy of this section. Within a reasonable time after receipt of the order,
the Board will make a determination as to whether the order is an EDRO
as defined in MCLA § 38.1701 et seq. and will notify the member and the
alternate payee(s) in writing of the determination. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the retirement system, the retirement system may
make a distribution to an alternate payee pursuant to an order that the
Board of Trustees has determined to be an EDRO prior to the date the
member attains his or her earliest retirement age, as defined in Code
Section 414(p)(4)(B), only if the EDRO specifically requires the
retirement system to make a distribution prior to such date.
B. Specific requirements of an EDRO. In order for a domestic relations order
to be an EDRO, it must specifically state all of the following: (1) the
name, last known mailing address (if any) and the social security
§ 2-263 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-263.1
1:X-47
§ 2-264. Termination of retirement system.
The City, at any time, can terminate the retirement system and trust fund in
whole or in part in accordance with, and subject to, state and federal law, this
plan, applicable collective bargaining agreements, consideration of concerns
submitted in writing by a designated representative of a non-bargaining unit
of employees, and the following provisions:
number of the member and each alternate payee(s) covered by the
order; (2) the dollar amount or percentage of the benefit to be paid to
each alternate payee, or the manner in which the amount or percentage
is to be determined; (3) the number of payments or period to which
such order applies; and (4) the name of the plan to which the order
applies. The domestic relations order will not be deemed an EDRO if it
requires the retirement system to provide any type or form of benefit, or
any option not already provided for in the system, or increased benefits
determined on the basis of the actuarial value, or benefits in excess of
the member's retirement system benefit, or payment of benefits to an
alternate payee(s) required to be paid to another alternate payee under
another EDRO.
C. Disputed orders. If there is a question as to whether or not a domestic
relations order is an EDRO, there will be a delay in any payout to any
payee(s), including the member, until the status is resolved. If the
retirement system determines that the order is not an EDRO, the
retirement system shall notify the employee and the alternate payee(s)
of this determination. The notification shall specify the reasons the order
was not determined to be an EDRO. This determination does not prohibit
the employee or the alternate payee(s) or the court from filing an
amended order with the retirement system for redetermination.
D. Death of alternate payee(s). If an alternate payee(s) dies before
receiving any payment of a benefit pursuant to an EDRO, that interest
reverts to the member.
A. Termination of retirement system. The City can terminate the retirement
system and trust fund by filing written notice of any such termination
with the Board of Trustees and members. If required by law, such written
notice will be provided at least 60 days (or any other period as may be
required by law or regulation) prior to the date of termination.
B. Vesting requirement. Upon termination of the retirement system, or
upon termination of the system with respect to a group of members
which constitutes a partial termination of the system, the accrued
benefits of all members with respect to whom the system is terminated
shall, as of the date of termination or partial termination, as the case
may be, become fully vested and nonforfeitable to the extent then
funded.
C. Continued administration of retirement system pending distribution.
Upon complete termination of the retirement system, the Board of
§ 2-263.1 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2-264
1:X-48
Trustees will continue to administer the retirement system until
distribution has been made to the members (which distribution must
occur within a reasonable time after the termination of the system) with
full settlement of all such benefits made by lump sum payments of the
actuarial equivalent of benefits and/or through the purchase of a group
annuity contract or individual annuity contracts to the extent of trust
fund assets.
D. Allocation of trust fund assets to members, spouses and beneficiaries. If
the retirement system is terminated, the trust fund will be first used to
fund the costs of benefits due members.
E. Retirement system merger or consolidation. The retirement system and
trust fund may not be merged or consolidated with, nor may any of its
assets or liabilities be transferred to, any other plan, unless the benefits
payable to each member if the retirement system was terminated
immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer would be equal
to or greater than the benefits to which such member would have been
entitled if this retirement system had been terminated immediately
before such merger, consolidation or transfer.

prior or current remodeling and/or rehabilitation work on any building,
are to be removed from the building or premises unless such items are
planned to be reused at some future date. The Building Official may
permit such items to remain when reuse is not planned if they can be
rendered safe and will not otherwise constitute a violation of this Code or
other law.
B. A building permit must be obtained from the Buildings Division for

design rules promulgated by the State of Michigan. When
renovation work is done to less than 50% of an existing building, the
area renovated and a means of exit travel from the area to the exterior
must comply with the referenced barrier-free rules. All additions to
existing buildings must comply with the referenced barrier-free rules.
§ 9-6 KALAMAZOO CODE § 9-7
8:I-6
§ 9-8. Permit duration and expiration.
Regardless of any other language in this chapter, the Building Official may
grant an extension to the starting time for any permit issued under the
provisions of this chapter for a maximum of 30 days if the permit holder
requests such an extension in writing and provides evidence that the delay
is caused by action over which the permit holder has no control. Likewise,
the Building Official may grant an extension to the period of construction
inactivity after work has commenced for a maximum of 30 days under the
same procedure and conditions as allowed for the delay in starting work. A
limit of two such extensions in either case may be granted by the Building
D. When and where renovation work is of such a scope that either face of a
hollow wall or partition is removed and replaced, all services exposed
within said wall or partition shall be brought up to current building,
electrical, mechanical and plumbing codes. This same requirement
applies to work which includes removing and replacing ceilings and
removing and replacing floor construction. When such work includes
adding electrical devices, any new circuits required to feed those devices
to avoid overloading existing circuits shall be added.
E. Debris resulting from demolition and other construction work is to be
regularly and promptly removed from the site and disposed of in
compliance with all federal, state and local regulations. As long as a
dumpster or other debris container is not full, and its contents do not
pose a hazard or violate any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, the
dumpster need not be emptied until completion of the work for which
the permit was issued. Dumpsters and any other containers used to
collect such debris shall be placed and protected on the construction site
so that they do not attract unauthorized use for trash and garbage
disposal by persons other than those engaged in work on the site. When
containers for debris from demolition or other construction work are not
required or used for a period of two weeks and are accessible to
unauthorized use, they are to be removed from the site. If such removal
is not made, such containers may be declared a nuisance and their
removal accomplished under provisions of Chapter 2148, §§ 21-3 through
21-5, of the City Code of Ordinances.
F. When the repair of plumbing piping requires the replacement of a
section of metal water supply piping, and the replacement pipe is
nonmetallic, the two ends of the metal piping shall be bonded to
maintain electrical grounding continuity past the nonmetallic pipe.
G. When new electrical wiring is required in any finished area in a dwelling
unit, and such wiring cannot be concealed within walls, under floors or
above ceilings, then such exposed wiring shall be done in a complete
wiring distribution system specifically designed to be surface-mounted

C. The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon
the last local tax assessment record shall be notified of the amount of
the costs referred to in Subsection B by first class mail at the address

unlawful construction, alteration, conversion or maintenance, to
restrain, correct or abate such violation or any nuisance, to prevent the
occupation of such building or to prevent any illegal act, conduct or
business in or about such building. The procedure for such action shall

B. The judgment of the court in such cause may direct the corrections,
repair or rehabilitation of the building or the abatement of the nuisance,
may authorize a reasonable time within which the defendant may make
such corrections, repairs, rehabilitation or abatement, and may
authorize the Building Official to execute and carry out the provisions of
the judgment in case of default by the defendant. Whenever the City has
incurred any expense for the enforcement of this chapter or the
judgment of the court, the City may sue the owner or possessor of the
premises, or both, and may recover the amount of such expense, in
addition to the costs of suit.
C. The City shall have a lien upon the premises for the expenses necessarily
incurred in the execution of such judgment which lien shall have priority
over all other liens or encumbrances, except taxes, assessments or
mortgages recorded previous to the existence of such lien. Such lien
may be foreclosed as in the case of foreclosure of mortgages by court

structure on which it is mounted a distance of 18 inches or more
over public property, or which extends over public property and
has a space between it and the building of three inches or more
shall be considered to be a sign projecting over the public rightof-
way.

(b) No sign projection over a sidewalk used by the public shall be
less than 11 feet in the clear above the sidewalk on streets and
not less than 15 feet above the sidewalk in alleys.
(c) Signs projecting over a public thoroughfare shall be kept at
least three feet back of the curbline unless more restrictive
requirements are applicable and set forth elsewhere; in which
case, the more restrictive requirement shall control.
A. Generally. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed
to resist wind and seismic forces as specified in this section. All bracing
systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to
the foundations. For signs on buildings, the dead and lateral loads shall
be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground
in such a manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof.
(1) The overturning movement produced from lateral forces shall in no
case exceed 2/3 of the dead load-resisting movement. Uplift due to
overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the
ground or to the structural frame of the building. The weight of earth
superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead
load-resisting movement. Such earth shall carefully placed and
thoroughly compacted.
B. Wind loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed
to resist wind forces as specified in the adopted building code of the City.
C. Seismic loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and
constructed to resist seismic forces as specified in the adopted building
code of the City.
D. Combined loads. Wind and seismic loads need not be combined in the
design of signs or sign structures; only that loading producing the larger
stresses need be used. Vertical design loads, except roofline loads, shall
be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind or seismic loads.
E. Allowable stresses. The design of wood, concrete, steel or aluminium
members shall conform to the applicable requirements of the adopted
building code of the City. Loads, both vertical and horizontal, exerted on
the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in such
code. Working stresses for wind or seismic loads combined with dead
loads may be increased as specified in such code.
A. Generally. The supports for all signs or sign structures shall be placed in
or upon private property and shall be securely built, constructed and
erected in conformity with this division.

§ 9-76. Clearance.
B. Materials. Construction materials for signs and sign structures shall be of
the quality and grade as specified for buildings in the adopted building
code of the City. All signs that project into the public right-of-way shall be
constructed of noncombustible materials, except for approved plastics,
and as otherwise provided in the allowable plastics, and as otherwise
provided in the allowable materials in the adopted building code of the
City.
(1) Anchors and supports, when of wood and embedded in the soil or
within six inches of the soil, shall be of all heartwood of a durable
species or shall be pressure-treated with an approved preservative.
Such members shall be marked or branded by an approved agency
as recognized under the building code.
C. Nonstructural trim. Nonstructural trim may be of wood, metal, approved
plastics or any combination thereof.
D. Anchorage. Members supporting unbraced signs shall be so
proportioned that the bearing loads imposed on the soil in either
direction, horizontal or vertical, does not exceed the safe values. Braced
ground signs shall be anchored to reset the specified wind or seismic
load acting in any direction. Anchors and supports shall be designed for
safe-bearing loads on the soil and for an effective resistance to pullout
amounting to a force 25% greater than the required resistance to
overturning. Anchors and supports shall penetrate to a depth
belowground greater than that of the frostline.
(1) Signs attached to masonry, concrete or steel shall be safely and
securely fastened thereto by means of metal anchors, bolts or
approved expansion screws of sufficient size and anchorage to
safely support the loads applied.
(2) No wooden blocks or plugs or anchors with wood used in connection
with screws or nails shall be considered proper anchorage except in
the case of signs attached to wood framing.
(3) No anchor or support of a sign shall be connected to or supported by
an unbraced parapet wall, unless such wall is designed in
accordance with the requirements for parapet walls specified for
seismic zones in the adopted building code of the City.
E. Approved plastics. The Building Official shall require that sufficient
technical data be submitted to substantiate the proposed use of any
plastic material; and, if it is determined that the evidence submitted is
satisfactory for the use intended, the Building Official may approve its
use.
A. Generally. Signs shall conform to the clearance requirements of this
section.

B. Clearance from high voltage power lines. Signs shall be located not less
than six feet horizontally or 12 feet vertically from overhead electrical
conductors which are energized in excess of 750 volts. As used in this
subsection, "overhead conductors" means any electrical conductor,
either bare or insulated, installed above the ground, except such
conductors as are enclosed in iron pipe or other material covering of
equal strength.
C. Clearance from fire escapes, exits or standpipes. No sign or sign
structure shall be erected in such a manner that any portion of its
surface or supports will interfere in any way with the free use of any
escape, exit or standpipe.
D. Openings. No sign shall obstruct any opening to such an extent that light
or ventilation is reduced to a point below that required by the adopted
building code of the City.
A. The Kalamazoo City Commission may, by resolution, establish
reasonable fees for covering the costs of actions taken with regard to a
sign or sign structure governed by all or part of this division of the City
Code.
B. The costs shall be a lien against the real property and shall be reported
to the assessing officer of the City who shall assess the cost against the
property on which the sign or sign structure is or was located.
C. The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon
the last local tax assessment record shall be notified of the amount of
the costs referred to in Subsection B, by first-class mail at the address
shown on the record. If he fails to pay the same within 30 days after
mailing by the assessor of the notice of the amount thereof, the Assessor
shall add the same to the next tax roll of the City; and the same shall be
collected in the same manner in all respects as provided by law for the
collection of taxes.

additional information can be obtained from the owner and/or the
City and presented to the Board.

repaired by the City or its designee, the decision shall provide a
complete list of all repairs necessary to eliminate the dangerous
conditions, along with an estimated cost to complete them.

the ordered task, the amount of the receiver's bid to the City.
B. The owner shall pay the invoice within 30 days of the date on the
invoice. If the owner fails to pay the invoice within such thirty-day

as delinquent property taxes.
D. Any judgment, including the cost for reasonable attorney fees incurred,
obtained by the City shall bear interest at the statutory allowed rate for
money judgments.

ARTICLE II
Continuity in Government in Event of Attack
[Derived from Adm. Code § A226]
§ 12-20. Title of article.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Continuity of
Government Ordinance of the City of Kalamazoo."
§ 12-21. Finding of fact.
Because of the existing possibility of an attack upon the United States of
unprecedented size and destructiveness, including the inevitable hazards of
radioactive contamination, and in order, in the event of such an attack, to
assure the continuation of effective, legally constituted leadership, authority
and responsibility in the offices of the government of this City, it is found and
declared by the City Commission to be necessary to provide for emergency
interim officers who can exercise the powers and discharge the duties of
the key executive, administrative and legislative offices of this City in the
event that the incumbents thereof, and their deputies, assistants or other
subordinate officers authorized, pursuant to law, to exercise the powers and
discharge the duties of such offices, are killed, missing, disabled or for some
other cause unable to perform the duties and functions of their offices during
and immediately after an enemy attack.
§ 12-22. Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to the interpretation and administration
of this article, unless the context otherwise clearly indicates:
ATTACK — Any attack or series or attacks by an enemy of the United
States causing, or which may cause, substantial damage or injury to civilian
property or persons in the United States in any manner, by sabotage or
by the use of bombs, missiles, shellfire or atomic, radiological, chemical,
bacteriological or biological means or other weapons or processes.
DULY AUTHORIZED DEPUTY — A person who is presently authorized to
perform all of the functions, exercise all of the powers and discharge all of
the duties of an office in the event the office is vacant or at such times as it
lacks administration due to the death, absence or disability of the incumbent
officer.
EMERGENCY INTERIM SUCCESSOR — A person designated pursuant to this
article for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but
not the office, of a City officer in the event that such officer or any duly
authorized deputy is unavailable to exercise the powers and discharge the
duties of the office.
UNAVAILABLE — Either that a vacancy in office exists and there is no deputy
authorized to exercise all of the powers and discharge the duties of the office,
or that the lawful incumbent of the office (including any deputy exercising
the powers and discharging the duties of an office because of a vacancy) and
§ 12-20 CIVIL DEFENSE § 12-22
12:II-1
his duly authorized deputy are absent or unable, for physical, mental or legal
reasons, to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the office.
§ 12-23. Designation of emergency interim successors.
§ 12-24. Qualifications of emergency interim successors.
No person shall be designated or serve as an emergency interim successor,
unless he may, under the Constitution and statutes of this state and the
Charter and ordinances of this City, hold the office of the person to whose
powers and duties he is designated to succeed, but no provision of any
ordinance prohibiting an officer or employee of this City from holding another
office shall be applicable to an emergency interim successor.
§ 12-25. Oath of emergency interim successors.
At the time of their designation, emergency interim successors shall take
such oath and do such other things, if any, as may be required to qualify
them to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the office to which
they may succeed.
§ 12-26. Term of emergency interim successor.
A person designated as an emergency interim successor holds that
designation at the pleasure of the designator; provided that, he must be
replaced if removed. He retains his designation as emergency interim
successor until replaced by another appointed by the authorized designator.
A. Within 30 days after first entering upon the duties of their office, the City
Commissioners shall adopt a resolution listing the most recent 20
available persons who have served in such office, but no longer are so
serving, to act as their emergency interim successors. If the Mayor and
Vice Mayor shall be unavailable, the functions of Mayor shall be
performed by the person selected by the Commissioners or a majority
thereof.
B. Within 30 days after first entering upon the duties of his office, the City
Manager, City Clerk, City Treasurer, City Attorney, Police Chief, Fire Chief,
Director of Public Works, Civil Defense Director, Purchasing Agent,
Director of Utilities and Director of Parks and Recreation shall, in addition
to any duly authorized deputy, designate such number of emergency
interim successors to his office and specify their rank in order of
succession, after any duly authorized deputy, so that there will be not
less than three duly authorized deputies or emergency interim
successors, or combination thereof, for the office.
C. The incumbent City officers above designated shall review and, as
necessary, promptly revise the designations of emergency interim
successors or duly authorized deputies, or any combination thereof, for
each officer specified.
§ 12-22 KALAMAZOO CODE § 12-27
12:II-2
§ 12-27. Assumption of powers and duties of officer by emergency
interim successor.
If, in the event of an attack, any officer named in § 12-23 and any duly
authorized deputy is unavailable, his emergency interim successor highest
in rank in order of succession, who is not unavailable, shall, except for
the power and duty to appoint emergency interim successors, exercise the
powers and discharge the duties of such officer. An interim successor shall
exercise these powers and discharge these duties only until such time as
the lawful incumbent officer or any duly authorized deputy or an emergency
interim successor higher in rank in order of succession exercises, or resumes
the exercise of, the powers and discharge of the duties of the office, or until,
where an actual vacancy exists, a successor is appointed to fill such vacancy
or is elected and qualified as provided by law.
§ 12-28. Records to be kept concerning authorized deputies and
emergency interim successors.
The name, address and rank in order of succession of each duly authorized
deputy shall be filed with the City Clerk and the County Clerk and each
designation, replacement or change in order of succession of an emergency
interim successor shall become effective when the designator files with the
City Clerk and the County Clerk the successor's name, address and rank
in order of succession. The City Clerk and the County Clerk shall keep on
file all such data regarding duly authorized deputies and emergency interim
successors and it shall be open to public inspection.
§ 12-29. Suspension of Commission quorum and vote requirements
in event of attack.
In the event of an attack, quorum requirements for the City Commission
shall be suspended, and where the affirmative vote of a specified proportion
of members, for approval of an ordinance, resolution or other action, would
otherwise be required, the same proportion of those voting thereon shall be
sufficient.

Outdoor Furnaces68
[Adopted 8-3-2009 by Ord. No. 1858; amended in its entirety
8-19-2019 by Ord. No. 1995]
§ 15-17. Purpose.
§ 15-18. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
CLEAN WOOD — Wood that has no paint, stains, or other types of coatings,
and wood that has not been treated or combined with any petroleum
product, chemical, preservative, adhesive, or other substance, including, but
not limited to, copper chromium, arsenate, creosote, or pentachlorophenol.
OUTDOOR FURNACE — Sometimes referred to as a "hydronic heater," any
boiler, stove, furnace, or other appliance designed, intended or used to
provide heat and/or hot water to any residence or other structure, which
operates by the burning of wood, coal, corn, or other type of solid fuel, and
which is not located within a building intended for habitation by humans or
domestic animals. Not included in this definition is any device which is fueled
by natural gas, propane or fuel oil, if the device has been inspected and
A. Research conducted by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency indicates that outdoor furnaces cause emission problems which
can affect human health and safety. Smoke generated by outdoor
furnaces can cause visibility problems, worsen cardiovascular diseases,
irritate eyes and lungs, trigger headaches, and contribute to respiratory
diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis. In addition,
emissions from outdoor furnaces contain harmful air pollutants such as
sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and other potentially
disease-causing compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
benzene, formaldehyde, and dioxins.
B. Persons living and working within residential, commercial, and industrial
establishments situated within the City are entitled to clean air and
environmental circumstances free of unreasonable smoke, odor, and
fumes, as well as living within an aesthetically pleasing environment
through the proper storage of debris and combustible fuels.
C. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare of the residents of the City of Kalamazoo from excessive smoke,
pollution, soot, contamination, and other toxic air pollutants and
offensive odors emanating from outdoor furnaces and to regulate the
location and use of same.

Commission and the City Commission shall have not more than one
year, unless otherwise authorized by the City Commission, to take the
following actions:
(1) The Kalamazoo Historic Preservation Commission shall prepare and
submit a final report with its recommendations and the
recommendations, if any, of the City of Kalamazoo Planning
Commission to the City Commission. If the recommendation is to
establish an historic district or districts, the final report shall include

(2) After receiving a final report that recommends the establishment of
an historic district or districts, the City Commission, at its discretion,
may introduce and pass or reject an ordinance or ordinances. If the
City of Kalamazoo passes an ordinance or ordinances establishing
one or more historic districts, the City of Kalamazoo shall file a copy
of that ordinance or those ordinances, including a legal description
of the property or properties located within the historic district or
districts, with the Kalamazoo County Register of Deeds. The City of
Kalamazoo shall not pass an ordinance establishing a contiguous
historic district less than 60 days after a majority of the property
owners within the proposed historic district, as listed on the tax rolls
of the local unit, have approved the establishment of the historic
district pursuant to a written petition.
E. A writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by the
Kalamazoo Historic Preservation Commission in the performance of an

1-18-2005 by Ord. No. 1780; 4-30-2007 by Ord. No. 1824]
The South Street Area Historic District, which was created pursuant to Act No.
169 of the Public Acts of 1970, MCLA § 399.201 et seq., as amended, is now
titled the "South Street - Vine Area Historic District," and is hereby amended
to include all of the properties included in the following boundary description:
procedures set forth in § 16-4 and shall consider any previously written
reports by the Kalamazoo Historic Preservation Commission or any
previously appointed Historic District Study Committee pertinent to the
proposed action.
B. If considering elimination of an historic district, the Kalamazoo Historic
Preservation Commission shall follow the procedures set forth in § 16-4
for issuing a preliminary report, holding a public hearing, and issuing a
final report but with the intent of showing one or more of the following:
(1) The historic district has lost those physical characteristics that
enabled establishment of the district.
(2) The historic district was not significant in the way previously
defined.
(3) The historic district was established pursuant to defective
procedures.
C. Upon receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of historic,
architectural, archaeological, engineering, or cultural significance of a
proposed historic district, the City Commission may, at its discretion,
adopt a resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the
proposed historic district be referred to the Kalamazoo Historic District
Commission as prescribed in this chapter. The Kalamazoo Historic
District Commission shall review permit applications with the same
powers that would apply if the proposed historic district was an
established historic district. The review may continue in the proposed
historic district for not more than one year, or until such time as the City
Commission approves or rejects the establishment of the historic district
by ordinance, whichever occurs first.
D. If the City Commission determines that pending work will cause
irreparable harm to resources located within an established historic
district or a proposed historic district, the City Commission may by
resolution declare an emergency moratorium of all such work for a
period not to exceed six months. The City Commission may extend the
emergency moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six
months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is
still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource
subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.

guidelines for work on historic resources to carry out its duties under
this chapter and the Local Historic Districts Act, MCLA § 399.201 et
seq.
B. The Historic District Commission may:
(1) Maintain public historic resources in the local historic district or
districts using its own funds, if not specifically earmarked for other
purposes, or those public funds committed to this use by the City
Commission.
(2) Act as the agent of the City Commission to accept and administer
grants and gifts for historical preservation purposes in the historic
district or districts.
A. A permit shall be obtained before any work affecting the exterior
appearance of a resource is performed within an historic district or, if
required under Subsection E, work affecting the interior arrangements of
a resource is performed within an historic district. The person, individual,
partnership, firm, corporation, organization, institution, or agency of
government proposing to do that work shall file an application for a
permit with the Building Official. The Building Official shall immediately
refer the application for a permit together with all required supporting
materials that make the application complete to the Historic
Preservation Coordinator. A permit shall not be issued and proposed
work shall not proceed until the Historic Preservation Coordinator or the
Historic District Commission has acted on the application by issuing a
certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed as prescribed in this
chapter. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be issued unless the
applicant certifies in the application that the property where work will be
undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion
date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the
requirements of the Stille-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction
Code Act, 1972 P.A. 230, MCLA §§ 125.1501 to 125.1531. The City may
charge a reasonable fee to process a permit application, said fee to be
set by the Building Official.
B. In reviewing plans, the Historic Preservation Coordinator shall consider
and apply relevant design standards established by the Historic District
Commission and adopted by resolution of the City Commission and is
authorized to approve proposed work which complies with the Historic
Design Standards, as adopted, and issue certificates of appropriateness.
The Historic Preservation Coordinator shall regularly report the issuance
of such certificates of appropriateness to the Historic District
Commission. On a monthly basis, the Historic District Commission shall
§ 16-22 FILLING STATIONS § 16-23
14:II-3
review the certificates of appropriateness that have been issued to
determine the appropriateness thereof and whether or not the delegated
responsibilities of the Historic Preservation Coordinator should be
continued. The Historic District Commission shall provide to the Historic
Preservation Coordinator or other delegated staff specific written
standards for issuing certificates of appropriateness under this
subsection.
C. If the proposed work is not addressed by the Design Standards, then that
proposal shall be referred to the Historic District Commission.
D. When reviewing the application for permit, the Historic District
Commission shall follow the Secretary of Interior's "Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" as set
forth in 36 CFR Part 67. Design review standards and guidelines that
address special design characteristics of historic districts administered
by the Historic District Commission may be followed if they are
equivalent in guidance to the Secretary of Interior's standards and
guidelines and are established or approved by the Department of
History, Arts, and Libraries. The Historic District Commission shall also
consider all of the following:
(1) Local design guidelines, as they are adopted by resolution of the
City Commission; and
(2) The historical or architectural value and significance of the resource
and its relationship to the historical value of the surrounding area;
and
(3) The relationship of any architectural features of the resource to the
rest of the resource and to the surrounding area; and
(4) The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture and
materials proposed to be used; and
(5) Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the Historic District
Commission finds relevant.
(6) Whether the applicant has certified in the application that the
property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the
proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke
alarm complying with the requirements of the Stille-DeRossett-Hale
Single State Construction Code Act, 1972 P.A. 230, MCLA
§§ 125.1501 to 125.1531.
E. The Historic Preservation Coordinator or the Historic District Commission
shall review and act upon only exterior features of a resource and,
except for noting compliance with the requirement to install a fire alarm
system or a smoke alarm, shall not review and act upon interior
arrangements unless specifically authorized to do so by the City
Commission or unless interior work will cause visible change to the
exterior of the resource. The Historic District Commission shall not
§ 16-23 KALAMAZOO CODE § 16-23
14:II-4
disapprove an application due to considerations not prescribed in
Subsection B.
F. If an application is for work that will adversely affect the exterior of a
resource the Historic District Commission considers valuable to the City,
state, or nation, and the Historic District Commission determines that
the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public
purpose of the City, state, or nation, the Historic District Commission
shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an
economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource.
G. Work within an historic district shall be permitted through the issuance of
a notice to proceed by the Historic District Commission if any of the
following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be
demonstrated by a finding of the Historic District Commission to be
necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following
conditions:
(1) The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to
the occupants.
(2) The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program which
will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant
proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning
approvals, financing and environmental clearances.
(3) Retention of the resource would cause undue financial hardship to
the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other
events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all
feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may
include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or
moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district, have
been attempted and exhausted by the owner.
(4) Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the
community.
H. The Historic District Commission and the Historic Preservation
Coordinator shall file with the Building Official the certificate of
appropriateness, notice to proceed or notice of denial for plans
submitted to it for review.
(1) No work shall begin until a certificate of appropriateness or a notice
to proceed is filed.
(2) A certificate of appropriateness, notice to proceed or notice of denial
is binding on the Building Official, Historic Preservation Coordinator,
and the applicant. No permit shall be issued and no work shall be
done contrary to any certificate of appropriateness, notice to
proceed or notice of denial issued.

In case of an application for a permit for work affecting the exterior
appearance of a resource or for the moving or demolition of a resource which
the Commission deems so valuable to the City, state or nation that the loss
thereof will adversely affect the public purpose of the City, state or nation,
the Commission shall endeavor to negotiate with the owner an economically
feasible plan for preservation of the resource.
§ 16-25. Records. [Adm. Code § A229.3.3; amended 1-18-2005 by
Ord. No. 1780]

actions. A writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by
the Commission in the performance of an official function shall be maintained
in the Planning and Community Development Department and shall be made
available to the public in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act,
1976 PA 442, MCLA §§ 15.231 to 15.246.
§ 16-26. Appeals from Commission. [Adm. Code § A229.7; amended
1-18-2005 by Ord. No. 1780]
(3) The failure of the Historic District Commission or the Historic
Preservation Coordinator to act within 60 calendar days after the
date a complete application is filed, unless an extension is agreed
upon in writing by the applicant and the Historic District Commission
or the Historic Preservation Coordinator, shall be considered to
constitute approval.
(4) A notice of denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation
including:
(a) The reason for denial citing the Secretary of Interior's
"Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings" and relevant standards from the Historic
District Commission Standards and Guidelines; and
(b) A proposal for a remedy; and
(c) A notice that an application may be resubmitted for
Commission review when suggested changes have been made;
and
(d) Notification of the applicant's rights of appeal to the State
Historic Preservation Review Board and to the circuit court.
A. Any persons jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the Historic
District Commission may file an appeal with the State Historic

the Department of State. The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after
the decision is furnished to the applicant. A permit applicant aggrieved

1527; 1-18-2005 by Ord. No. 1780]
by a decision of the State Historic Preservation Review Board may appeal
the decision to the Kalamazoo County circuit court.
B. Any citizen or duly organized historic preservation organization in the
local unit, as well as resource property owners, jointly or severally
aggrieved by the decision of the Historic District Commission may
appeal the decision to the Kalamazoo County circuit court except that a
permit applicant under § 16-23 may not appeal to the court without first
exhausting the right to appeal to the State Historic Preservation Review
Board as specified in § 16-26A.
A. Failure to begin work within a reasonable time or at least within six
months following the issuance of the certificate of appropriateness or
notice to proceed, or failure to complete work within a reasonable period
of time shall constitute abandonment by the applicant, and the
certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed shall expire. No work
shall begin until a new certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed
is issued or a request for extension is filed and approved in accordance
with this chapter.
B. If the work is not commenced or completed in a timely manner or is
otherwise not in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness or
the notice to proceed, the applicant shall be notified by the building
official and given a reasonable period of time in which to correct said
work to conform to the certificate of appropriateness or the notice to
proceed.
C. When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the
Commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Commission may require an owner to restore the
resource to the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate
work or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of
appropriateness. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or
modification requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission may
seek an order from the circuit court to require the owner to restore the
resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies
for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply or
cannot comply with the order of the court, the Commission or its agents
may enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the
resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for
a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the court's order. The
costs of the work shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by
the local unit as a special assessment against the property. When acting
pursuant to an order of the circuit court, a Commission or its agents may
enter a property for purposes of this section.

resource unlawfully constructed, added to, altered, repaired, moved,
excavated or demolished.
§ 16-31. Review of applications within proposed historic district;
emergency moratorium. [Added 1-18-2005 by Ord. No. 1780]

architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance or a proposed local
historic district, the City Commission may, at its discretion, adopt a
resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed
local historic district be referred to the Historic District Commission as
described in § 16-23. The Historic District Commission shall review

resolution declare an emergency moratorium of all such work for a
period not to exceed six months. The City Commission may extend the
emergency moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six
months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is
still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource
subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.

shall remove or cause to be removed any condemnation notice without
permission of the City.
B. No person shall occupy or be present in a dwelling, dwelling unit, or the
premises, if it is condemned or if it constitutes a nuisance as defined in

temporary emergencies where discontinuance of service is approved by the
City. The requirements of § 17-22 of the City Code of Ordinances shall not
apply to § 17-11.
§ 17-12. Inspections to enforce chapter — Generally.
For purposes of enforcement and administration of Chapter 17 of the City
Code, the following shall apply:
A. The City shall make inspections for the enforcement of this chapter. Such
inspections are based on a legislative reaffirmation by the City that the
most effective way to obtain compliance with the minimum
requirements of this chapter is through routine periodic inspections of all
premises regulated by this chapter, including hotels, motels, bed-andbreakfast
inns, residential cooperatives, residential collectives, rooming
houses, and all rental housing as mandated by Michigan law, and as
expressly endorsed by the United States Supreme Court. These
inspections may be supplemented as needed with inspections
undertaken on the basis of one or more of the provisions found
elsewhere in this chapter.
B. Subject to the provisions of § 17-12.1, the Building Official, or any
inspectors working under the Building Official's authority, may request
permission to enter all premises regulated by this chapter, at reasonable
hours, to undertake an inspection. Upon an emergency, as defined under
rules promulgated by the City, the inspector or team of inspectors shall
have the right to enter at any time. Unless otherwise provided in this
chapter, or by a policy or an administrative rule, such inspections shall
include a thorough examination of all parts of such rental units and the
premises connected therewith, including all common areas and all
dwelling units, for any violation of the applicable regulations which could
affect the health, safety and welfare of any occupant or use of the
premises, regardless of whether such dwelling units are rental units as
defined by this chapter. The Building Official or any other inspector is
§ 17-10 KALAMAZOO CODE § 17-12
14:I-10
also empowered to make an inspection of any portion of any premises
regulated by this chapter when there is probable cause to suspect that
there is a violation of this chapter at the premises in question. Such
inspections may be accomplished by a search warrant as provided for by
this chapter and state law, by access voluntarily provided by the owner
or responsible local agent to unoccupied units and common areas, or by
access voluntarily provided by a resident of a dwelling unit occupied by
that resident.
C. The City Manager may promulgate rules governing the length of
certificates of compliance, the number of units inspected in multiple
dwellings or multiple-dwelling complexes, and under what
circumstances inspections are waived. The initial rules shall take effect
upon endorsement by resolution of a majority of the City Commission.
The City Manager shall have the authority to amend or replace any rules
previously endorsed by resolution of the City Commission, provided that
any proposed amendment or replacement shall be presented to the City
Commission as an information item on the agenda of a regularly
scheduled City Commission meeting held at least 30 days prior to the
proposed effective date of such amended or replacement rules.
D. The City shall have the authority under this chapter to obtain a search
warrant to perform any inspection authorized by this chapter or by state
law. Such a search warrant is considered an administrative search
warrant and shall permit an inspection to go forward only for purposes
authorized by this chapter and state law. The City may also request an
administrative search warrant when the premises in question have not
been inspected within the time period prescribed by ordinance, by
administrative policy, or by rule, or when the premises have not
previously been certified or no longer have a current certificate of
compliance.
E. In addition to the inspections required by § 17-12B, an inspection may be
authorized on one or more of the following bases:
(1) An area basis, such that all the regulated premises in a
predetermined geographical area will be inspected simultaneously
or within a short period of time.
(2) A complaint basis, such that complaints of violations will be
inspected within a reasonable time.
(3) A recurrent violation basis, such that those premises which are
found to have a high incidence of recurrent or uncorrected violations
will be inspected more frequently.
F. Inspections under this section shall be carried out by the City and may
include such representatives of other agencies as may form an
inspection team to undertake an inspection under this chapter and other
applicable ordinances.
§ 17-12 FILLING STATIONS § 17-12
14:I-11
§ 17-12.1. Systematic inspection procedures.
G. In a nonemergency situation in which the owner or occupant demands a
search warrant, the City shall obtain a warrant from a court of competent
jurisdiction. The occupant shall have the exclusive right to demand a
search warrant for an inspection of any dwelling unit. The warrant shall
state the address of the building to be inspected, the nature of the
inspection, as defined in this chapter or other applicable ordinances, and
the reasons for the inspection. It shall be appropriate and sufficient to
set forth the basis for inspection (e.g., mandatory periodic inspection,
complaint, area or recurrent violation basis) established in this section,
in other applicable statutes or ordinances or in rules or regulations. The
warrant shall also state that it is issued pursuant to authority granted by
this chapter and by the authority of § 127 of Public Act 167 of 1917, as
amended (MCLA § 125.527), and that it is for the purposes set forth for
the inspection of rental property by state statutes and City ordinances.
The owner and/or responsible local agent shall be responsible for
providing access whenever a search warrant is issued pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
H. The City may establish and charge a reasonable fee for inspections
conducted under this chapter. All such fees shall be approved by a
resolution adopted by the City Commission.
A. It is the policy of the City of Kalamazoo that its staff will work
cooperatively with landlords, tenants, neighborhood associations and
other interested groups and individuals to help ensure safe, decent and
sanitary rental housing through the systematic inspection of rental
properties pursuant to the requirements prescribed by this chapter.
B. The owner and/or responsible local agent shall contact the City to
schedule the systematic inspection in a timely manner such that the
certificate of compliance can be issued prior the expiration of the thencurrent
certificate of compliance.
C. It shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or responsible local agent
to contact the City to schedule the systematic inspection required by this
chapter.
D. Once a date for an inspection is scheduled, the owner and/or responsible
local agent shall do all of the following prior to the date of the scheduled
inspection:
(1) Inform the tenant or occupant of each dwelling unit scheduled for
possible inspection of the date when the inspection is scheduled to
occur.
(2) Request permission from the tenant or occupant of each dwelling
unit scheduled for possible inspection to enter the rental unit in the
event that the tenant or occupant is not at home when the inspector
arrives.
§ 17-12 KALAMAZOO CODE § 17-12.1
14:I-12
(3) Inform the tenant or occupant of each dwelling unit scheduled for
possible inspection that the owner or the owner's representative is
required to accompany the inspector during the performance of all
inspections of rental dwelling units, and that the owner or the
owner's representative must provide access to the inspector by
unlocking the dwelling unit's door in the event that the tenant is not
at home.
E. In all cases where a tenant or occupant has informed the owner or
responsible local agent, either orally or in writing, that the inspector may
have access to the dwelling unit, the owner shall provide access to the
dwelling unit in question for purposes of conducting the inspection
required by this chapter.
F. If a tenant who has consented to the inspection informs the owner or
responsible local agent that he or she would like to be present during the
inspection, but that the time scheduled for the inspection is not
convenient, the owner or responsible local agent shall inform the City of
the tenant's desire to be present when the inspection occurs. The City
shall make a reasonable effort to comply with the tenant's request. If the
City, owner, and tenant cannot schedule a mutually convenient time for
the inspection, the City shall have the discretion to seek a search
warrant to inspect that dwelling unit pursuant to authority granted by
this chapter and state law.
G. If a tenant or occupant of a unit scheduled for possible inspection
informs the owner or responsible local agent that he or she will demand
that the City obtain a search warrant, the owner or responsible local
agent shall inform the tenant that the owner or responsible local agent is
required by City code to accompany the inspector during the execution
of a search warrant, and is required to provide access to any dwelling
unit when a proper search warrant has been issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction. If a search warrant is issued at the request of a
tenant, the City shall make a reasonable effort to inform the tenant of
the date of execution of the search warrant.
H. In all cases where a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a search
warrant authorizing the inspection of a particular dwelling pursuant to
MCLA § 125.527 and the provisions of this chapter, the owner or
responsible local agent shall accompany the inspector during the
execution of the search warrant and inspection of the named dwelling
units, and shall provide access to each dwelling unit described in that
search warrant.
I. The City may require the owner of a leasehold to do one or more of the
following:
(1) Provide the City access to the leasehold if the lease provides the
owner a right of entry.
(2) Provide access to areas other than a leasehold or areas open to
public view, or both.

made a complaint to the City.
J. Neither the City nor the owner may discriminate against an occupant on
the basis of whether the occupant requests, permits, or refuses entry to
the leasehold. An owner of a multiple dwelling shall not discriminate
against any person whose dwelling unit is randomly selected for
inspection by the City, nor shall any owner bill the cost of the inspection
to tenants or other occupants of a property which is inspected under the
provisions of this chapter.
K. The City shall not discriminate against an owner who has met the
requirements of Subsection I but has been unable to obtain the
permission of the tenant or occupant, based on the owner's inability to
obtain the permission.
A. In accordance with the requirements of Act 147 of the Public Acts of
1992, as amended, before the sale of a unit within a new facility or
rehabilitated facility, or the sale of any new or rehabilitated facility as a
whole, for which a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone certificate is in effect,
an inspection of such unit or facility shall be made by the City upon the
request of the seller to determine compliance with all local and all
applicable state construction and safety codes.
B. No sale of a unit within a new facility or rehabilitated facility, or the sale
of any new or rehabilitated facility as a whole, for which a Neighborhood
Enterprise Zone certificate is in effect shall be finalized until a certificate
attesting that the unit or facility complies with all local and all applicable
state construction and safety codes has been issued.
C. The City Commission shall by resolution set a fee for the inspection and
the issuance of a certificate of compliance required by this section.
D. As used in this section, the terms "new facility" and "rehabilitated
facility" shall have the same meanings as set forth in PA 147 of 1992, as
amended, being MCLA § 207.772. As used in this section, the term "unit"
includes a "condominium unit" as that term is defined in PA 147 of 1992,
as amended.

with the City Code and shall also be responsible for providing access to such
property for the purpose of making the inspections necessary to ensure such
compliance in conformance with applicable provisions of this chapter and
state law.
§ 17-16. Registration forms.
An application for registration shall be made in such form and in accordance

Kalamazoo County to recoup any unpaid balance owing on the invoice.

compliance order issued for the property, even though such order may
have been issued to the previous owner. Any new purchaser may obtain
a copy of any outstanding compliance order at the City of Kalamazoo.
Enforcement for failure to comply with any outstanding orders may be
transferred to a new owner without additional notice.
A. No person shall operate, lease, rent, occupy, or allow occupancy of a
hotel, including a bed-and-breakfast inn, rooming house, multiple
dwelling, residential cooperative, residential collective or any rental
dwelling, including single-family homes and duplexes, unless there is a
valid certificate of compliance issued by the City in the name of the
agent and issued for the specific hotel, rooming house, multiple
dwelling, residential cooperative, residential collective or rental dwelling.
The certificate of compliance shall be displayed in a conspicuous place in
each hotel, rooming house, and bed-and-breakfast inn at all times. The
certificate shall be issued in conformance with such rules as the City
Manager or his or her designee shall promulgate after registration with

compliance with the provisions of the Code and state law.
B. The City shall not issue a certificate of compliance unless a current

§ 17-21. Civil remedies for violations.
C. Upon revocation of a certificate of compliance or a determination by the
City that any dwelling unit or structure regulated by this chapter is unfit
for human habitation, the owner or operator of such unit or structure
shall immediately take appropriate legal action to vacate the premises,
including eviction proceedings. No person shall thereafter occupy the
dwelling unit or structure for sleeping or living purposes until the City
determines it complies with this Code. All vacant buildings shall remain
closed to casual entry as required in Chapter 9 of the City Code of
Ordinances.
A. The City may institute an action in the circuit court to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate, without limitation, any one of the following violations or
unlawful acts:
(1) The construction, alteration, conversion or maintenance of a
dwelling, including accessory structure, contrary to this chapter or
an order or notice given by the City.
(2) When the violation or act is considered to have created a nuisance.
(3) Under circumstances where the health, safety and welfare of any
occupant on the premises or any nearby structure is at risk.
B. The procedure for such action shall be the same as for any injunction or
abatement of a nuisance under Michigan court rules, statutes or the
common law. The remedies the City may seek in the judgment or order
entered by the court include without limitation:
(1) Direct the correction, repair or rehabilitation of the dwelling or
building.
(2) Abate the nuisance.
(3) Prevent the occupation of the dwelling, building or structure until
the violation or nuisance is corrected or abated.

failure to comply within the reasonable time provided.
C. Whenever the City has incurred any expense for the enforcement of this
chapter or the judgment or order of the court, the City may institute and
maintain a suit against the owner of the premises to recover such
expense in addition to the costs of suit. The City shall have a lien upon
the premises for the expenses necessarily incurred in the execution of
any judgment or order entered by the court under above Subsections A
and B. The lien shall have priority over all other liens or encumbrances,
except taxes, assessments or mortgages recorded previous to the

as delinquent real estate taxes or foreclosure of mortgages under state
law.
D. In any action instituted by the City under this section, the City Attorney
shall file, in the office of the register of deeds of the county, a notice of
the pendency of the action or proceeding. The filing of the notice may
occur when the action or proceeding is commenced; before or after final
judgment or order is entered; or at any time after the service of the
notice is made upon a defendant. The notice shall have the same force

until the subject property is in full compliance with all provisions of this
chapter, and shall set a reasonable deadline considering appropriate
circumstances for compliance. If the court finds by a preponderance of
the evidence that the defendant has not complied with an order to repair
the subject property, it shall order the defendant held in contempt and

additional powers and duties:
(1) Hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by officials charged with the

to review as provided by law.
(2) Where the literal application of specific provisions of this chapter
would result in an exceptional practical difficulty to the applicant,
the Board shall have the power, in passing upon appeals, to modify
a specific provision of this chapter, provided both of the following
requirements are satisfied:
(a) The performance of the particular part or item of the building or

adequate for its intended use and shall not substantially deviate
from performance required by this chapter for the safety and
welfare of the people of the City.
(b) The specific condition justifying the variance shall be neither so
general nor recurrent in nature as to make an amendment of
this chapter with respect to the condition reasonably desirable.
(3) The Building Board of Appeals may attach in writing any stipulations
in connection with granting of a variance that, in its judgment, are
necessary to protect public health, safety, and the general welfare
of the people of the City. The breach of those stipulations shall
automatically invalidate the variance and any certificate granted on
the basis of it. In no case shall more than a minimum variance from
this chapter be granted than is necessary to alleviate the
exceptional practical difficulty.

IPMC, Chapter 4 - Light, Ventilation and Occupancy Limitations
IPMC, Chapter 5 - Plumbing Facilities and Fixture Requirements
IPMC, Chapter 6 - Mechanical and Electrical Requirements
IPMC, Chapter 7 - Fire Safety Requirements

threshold of rooming house occupancy, see the Building Code), and
any other type of residential occupancy as defined by this Code and
the Uniform Fire Code. They shall be installed within individual
dwelling units. They shall be at least IAIOBC type and installed in a
path of egress where they are easily visible, accessible and
permanently mounted on a wall. All extinguishers shall be
maintained in an operable condition. Locations approved prior to the
adoption of this amendment, including mounting within labeled
closets or cupboards, will be allowed to remain until the extinguisher
needs replacement. Fire extinguishers within residential dwelling
units must be replaced every three years, or per the manufacturer's
recommendation. If there is no manufacture date on the fire
extinguisher, it shall be dated upon installation by the owner with a
permanent marker. All questions on fire extinguisher placement
within a dwelling unit, or on the replacement schedule, shall be the
final decision of the Building Official and/or Fire Marshal.

exterior shall be equipped at a minimum with a lockable latch
set with a dead latch which can always be released from the
interior by turning the knob and from the exterior by a key. The
hardware set shall have an exterior knob which always requires
the use of a key to be activated for entrance. Hardware sets
with this function are commonly referred to as storeroom,
vestibule or emergency lock sets. Such doors shall also be
equipped with an automatic closer. Exception: Dwellings of five
units or less do not require an automatic door closer.
(c) Hinges. Out-swing dwelling unit exit doors shall be equipped

near the interior of the door. If the door opens onto a deck or
porch, the area lighting the deck or porch may serve to meet
this requirement. Solar lighting may be utilized when designed/
intended for such a use and is UL listed for such a use. Private
balconies and patios, not accessible from the exterior or from
an adjacent unit, are exempt.
(f) Window locks. All operable sashes on the first three floors of any
residential building, or so located on any floor such that they

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 20B-1. Title.
This chapter is to be known and may be cited as the "City of Kalamazoo
Medical Marijuana Facilities Ordinance."
§ 20B-2. Purpose and intent.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to implement the provisions of
Public Act 281 of 2016, being the Michigan Medical Marihuana Facilities
Licensing Act (MMFLA), so as to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare of the residents and patients of the City by setting forth the
manner in which medical marihuana facilities can be operated in the
City. Further, the purpose of this chapter is to:
(1) Authorize the establishment of medical marihuana facilities within
the City and provide standards and procedures for the review,
issuance, renewal, and revocation of City-issued permits for such
facilities;
(2) Impose fees to defray and recover the cost to the City of the
administrative and enforcement costs associated with medical
marihuana facilities;
(3) Coordinate with laws and regulations that may be enacted by the
state addressing medical marihuana.
B. Legislative intent. This chapter authorizes the establishment of medical
marihuana facilities within the City of Kalamazoo consistent with the
provisions of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Facilities Act, and subject
to the following:
(1) Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and
transportation of medical marihuana remains illegal under federal
law, and marihuana remains classified as a "controlled substance"
by federal law. Nothing in this chapter is intended to promote or
condone the production, distribution, or possession of marihuana in
violation of any applicable law. Nothing in this chapter is intended to
grant immunity from any criminal prosecution under state or federal
law. This chapter does not protect patients, caregivers, or the
owners of properties on which a marihuana commercial operation is
occurring from prosecution or having their property seized by
federal law enforcement authorities.
(2) This chapter is to be construed to protect the public over medical
marihuana facility interests. The operation of a licensed medical
marihuana facility is a revocable privilege and not a right in the City.
Nothing in this chapter is to be construed to grant a property right
for an individual or business entity to engage, obtain, or have
renewed a City-issued permit to engage in the use, distribution,
§ 20B-1 LAND DIVISION § 20B-2
20A:I-1
cultivation, production, possession, transportation or sale of medical
marihuana as a commercial enterprise in the City.
(3) Any individual or business entity which purports to have engaged in
the use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession,
transportation or sale of medical marihuana as a commercial
enterprise in the City either prior to or after the enactment of this
chapter without obtaining the required authorization required by
this chapter is deemed to be an illegally established use, and as
such is not entitled to legal nonconforming status under this
chapter, the City Zoning Code, or state statutory or common law.
(4) Nothing in this chapter is intended to grant immunity from criminal
or civil prosecution, penalty or sanction for the cultivation,
manufacture, possession, use, sale, distribution or transport of
marihuana in any form, that is not in strict compliance with the
Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, the Medial Marihuana Facilities
Licensing Act, the Marihuana Tracking Act, and all applicable rules
promulgated by the State of Michigan regarding medical marihuana.
Strict compliance with any applicable state law or regulation is
deemed a requirement for the issuance or renewal of any permit
issued under this chapter, and noncompliance with any applicable
state law or regulation shall be grounds for revocation or
nonrenewal of any permit issued under the terms of this chapter.
C. Indemnification of City.
(1) By accepting a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the holder
waives and releases the City, its officers, elected officials, and
employees from any liability for injuries, damages or liabilities of
any kind that result from any arrest or prosecution of medical
marihuana facility owners, operators, employees, clients or
customers for a violation of state or federal laws, rules or
regulations.
(2) By accepting a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the holder
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its officers,
elected officials, employees, and insurers, against all liability, claims
or demands arising on account of any claim of diminution of
property value by a property owner whose property is located in
proximity to a licensed operating facility, arising out of, claimed to
have arisen out of, or in any manner connected with the operation of
a medical marihuana facility or any claim based on an alleged injury
to business or property by reason of a claimed violation of the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
D. Reservation of legislative prerogative.
(1) The City Commission reserves the right to amend or repeal this
chapter in any manner, including, but not limited to the complete
§ 20B-2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 20B-2
20A:I-2
§ 20B-3. Definitions.
elimination of any type or number of medical marihuana facilities
authorized to operate in the City.
(2) Nothing in this chapter may be held or construed to grant or
grandfather any medical marihuana facility a vested right, license,
permit or privilege to continued operations within the City.
(3) Given the adoption of 2018 Initiated Law No. 1, which legalized the
possession and use of marihuana by persons age 21 and older,
Section 199 of the City Charter providing for the establishment of
medical cannabis dispensaries, by its own terms, shall be null and
void. Therefore, it is determined that there is no rational basis to
treat or make allowances that treat a medical cannabis dispensary
apart from a provisioning center.
A. Unless the context requires a different meaning, any term used in this
chapter that is defined by the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, the
Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, or the Administrative Rules
promulgated by the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory
Affairs addressing medical marihuana shall have the definition given in

facility operating permit and is eligible to receive the appropriate
marihuana facility license from the Department. The applicant shall not
locate or operate a marihuana facility in the City without obtaining a
state operating license approved by and issued by the Department. A
provisional certificate issued by the City will expire and be void after one
year if state approval is not diligently pursued to completion by the
applicant, or on the date that state approval is denied by a final order to
the applicant, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that due to the
deliberateness of the state in issuing operating licenses, provisional
certificates issued by the City Clerk prior to January 1, 2019, will be
extended for a period of one year if on the date the provisional
certificate would otherwise expire, the holder of the provisional
certificate has been issued a notice of prequalification status by the
Department or a denial of prequalification status by the Department is
under appeal, and either: 1) an application for approval of the site plan
for the proposed facility has been filed with the Community Planning and

§ 20B-10. Issuance of City marihuana facility operating permit.
fails to submit such proof, then the provisional approval will be canceled

can be operated in accordance with the application submitted and the
applicable requirements of this chapter and any other applicable law,
rule, or regulation.
C. After verification that the business facilities are constructed and can be
operated in accordance with the application submitted and the
applicable requirements of this chapter and any other applicable law,
rule, or regulation, and the issuance of a permanent certificate of
occupancy for the facility, the City Clerk shall issue a City medical
marihuana operating permit for a term of one year. The City-issued
permit shall be prominently displayed within the facility.

condition for the issuance and maintenance of the City marihuana
facility operating permit issued under this chapter and the continued
operation of any medical marihuana facility.

duration of the permit, worker's compensation insurance as required
by state law, and general liability insurance with minimum limits of
$1,000,000 per occurrence and an aggregate limit of $2,000,000

by this chapter will be grounds for revocation of the City-issued
operating license.
F. A condition of the issuance of a medical marihuana operating permit
includes, at a minimum, operation of the business in compliance with all
the plans and the information provided to the City as part of the
application. A permittee must update any change in the information
provided to the City as part of the application within five business days
of such change during the term of the permit. The failure to timely
update a change in information will be grounds for suspension or
revocation of the operating permit.
A. A valid marihuana facility operating permit may be renewed on an
annual basis by a renewal application upon a form provided by the City
and payment of the annual license fee set by City Commission
resolution. An application to renew a marihuana facility operating permit
shall be filed no sooner than 90 days and at least 60 days prior to the
date of its expiration. The failure to timely file for renewal is sufficient
grounds to deny renewal of a permit to operate a medical marihuana
facility in the City and is not subject to appeal.
B. Prior to the issuance of a renewed marihuana facility permit by the City,
the premises shall be inspected to assure that it and its systems are in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

§ 20B-14. Permit as revocable privilege.

§ 20B-15. Nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of permit.
C. In determining whether to grant a renewal of a permit, the members of
the City's Economic Development Corporation Board will evaluate the
permit holder's compliance with the statements it provided with its initial
application and submission with its request for renewal of the following
information:
(1) The facility's staffing plan which describes the actual number of
employees, including the number and type of jobs that the facility
has created, and the amount and type of compensation (including

benefits to the City and the job creation for local residents achieved
by the facility, results of efforts for community outreach and worker

of an operating permit, the City Clerk shall renew the existing permit for
a period of one year, on the condition that the state operating license for
the facility is renewed.

thereon, the type of business disclosed on the application for the permit,
and the location for which the permit is issued.
B. Each operating permit is exclusive to the permittee and a permittee or
any other person must apply for a permit with the City Clerk before a
permit is transferred, sold, or purchased. The attempted transfer, sale,
or other conveyance of an interest in a permit without prior application
for a City operating permit with the City Clerk is grounds for suspension
or revocation of the existing permit.
A. The City may, after notice and hearing, suspend, revoke or refuse to
renew a permit for any of the following reasons:
§ 20B-12 KALAMAZOO CODE § 20B-15
20A:II-8
(1) The permit holder, or his or her agent, manager or employee, has
violated, does not meet, or has failed to comply with any of the
terms, requirements, conditions or provisions of this chapter or with
any applicable state or local law or regulation;
(2) The permit holder, or its agent, manager or employee, has failed to
comply with any special terms or conditions of its license pursuant

permit holder did not meet or failed to comply with one or more of
the requirements set forth at § 20B-12C.

(5) The permit holder failed to timely submit all necessary documents
and or fees to renew the City-issued permit or state operating
license.
B. Evidence to support a finding under this section may include, without
limitation, a continuing pattern of conduct, a continuing pattern of drugrelated
criminal conduct within the premises of the marihuana facility or
in the immediate area surrounding such business, a continuing pattern
of criminal conduct directly related to or arising from the operation of the
marihuana facility, or an ongoing nuisance condition emanating from or
caused by the marihuana facility. Criminal conduct is limited to the
violation of a state law or regulation or City ordinance.
C. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the Planning Commission
shall hear and decide questions that arise in the administration of this
chapter, including appeals of suspension and revocations of City
operating permits. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of
the Planning Commission is necessary to reverse an order, requirement,
decision, or determination of an administrative official in the application
of this chapter. The decision of the Planning Commission is final. This
section is not to be construed to grant the Planning Commission
authority to hear any matter that is within the powers and duties of the

greater amount when the vehicle is thereafter towed, may be assessed
against those persons described in Subsection E below. The fee shall not
be assessed when a vehicle is stickered but thereafter determined by the
City to not have been in violation.
C. A vehicle which is stickered and thereafter brought into compliance, but
which is thereafter in violation of this section within 60 days of the initial
stickering shall be subject, without further stickering, to abatement
action, including towing.

standard by a removal allowance, the combined wastestream
formula, a fundamentally different factors variance, or after more
than one of these modifications, the user shall submit any necessary
amendments to the information requested by the certification
provision at § 28-31A(6) and the schedule at § 28-31A(7).
B. Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the
case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the wastewater system, any user subject to such
pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Director a
report containing the information described in § 28-31A of this chapter.
For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate.
For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. In
cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management
practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by Director or the applicable standards to
determine compliance with the standard. This report must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 28-31A(6).
C. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) All SIUs and PIUs shall, at a frequency determined by the Director
but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December),
submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants
in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards and
the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for
the reporting period. Periodic compliance reports of all permitted
industrial users shall be signed and certified in accordance with
§ 28-31A(6) of this chapter. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by Director or the applicable standards
to determine compliance status of the user (40 CFR 403.12).
(2) All wastewater samples shall be representative of the industrial
user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in
good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(3) If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of
this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by
§ 28-31 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-31
27:III-4
the wastewater system, using the procedures prescribed in
§ 28-31A(5) of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be
included in the report. The sampling and analysis required in
Subsection C(1), (2) and (3) of this section may be performed by
the City in lieu of the industrial user. Where the City of Kalamazoo's
staff/contractor performs the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user, the City of Kalamazoo's staff/contractor shall
perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user
of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis.
Where the wastewater system performs the required sampling and
analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to
submit the report.
D. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
(1) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within
30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the City of
Kalamazoo's staff/contractor performs the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the industrial user, the City of Kalamazoo's staff/contractor
shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the
user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
analysis. The industrial user is not required to resample if the
wastewater system performs monitoring at the industrial user at
least once a month or if the wastewater system performs sampling
between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the
industrial user receives the results of his/her sampling.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Director within 24
hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration
of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass
has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
E. Report of changed conditions. Each user is required to notify the Director
of any planned changes to the industrial user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least
60 days before the change.
(1) The Director may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
§ 28-31 RAILROADS § 28-31
27:III-5
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application.
(2) The Director may issue or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit or ICD.
(3) No user shall implement the planned changed conditions, until and
unless the Director has responded to the industrial user's notice.
(4) For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 20% or greater,
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be
deemed significant.
F. Reports of potential problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause
potential problems for the wastewater system, it is the responsibility
of the industrial user to immediately orally notify the Director of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions taken by the industrial user.
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences.
Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense,
loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the wastewater system, natural resources or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which
may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
(3) Failure to notify the City of potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
(4) A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in
the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to
occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
G. Users must provide any and all other reports required by 40 CFR 403.12,
including BMP documentation where applicable.
H. Prior to installation and implementation of any plant and equipment that
may affect the pretreatment, volume or discharge of wastewater or
pollutants, the user shall submit designs of any proposed changes for
review and approval to the Director. Additional approvals as required by
local, state or federal regulations are the responsibility of the user. No
§ 28-31 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-31
27:III-6
construction shall commence until the user has obtained all appropriate
approvals in writing.
I. Upon request of the Director, a user must provide the following
information:

§ 28-31 RAILROADS § 28-31
27:III-7
§ 28-32. Monitoring, inspections, and surveillance.
(2) Users shall retain and preserve for no less than three years all
records relating to monitoring, sampling, chemical analyses and
BMP documentation made by or on behalf of the user. If a record
pertains to matters that are the subject of an order, litigation, or
other enforcement action, then the user shall retain and preserve
the record until all enforcement activities have concluded and all
periods of limitations for appeals have expired. Users shall make
these records available upon request to the Director for inspection
and copying.
M. Public information. All written information submitted to the Director shall
be available without restriction to any person upon request according to
the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, unless:
(1) The user provides, at the time the user submits the information, a
written notice to the Director that the user claims that all or part of
the information is exempt from disclosure according to the Michigan
Freedom of Information Act;
(2) The user demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that the
information is a trade secret; and
(3) When granted confidentiality, the portion of a report that might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to
this chapter, or the NPDES sludge or pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that the information shall be treated as
confidential by the governmental agency, until such time the
information has been determined to be nonconfidential by the
governmental agency.
A. Inspections:
(1) Users of the wastewater system are subject to facility inspections
and record review at the request of the Director during all
reasonable business hours, and in an emergency at any time. Said
inspections may include, but are not limited to, monitoring of these
users' operations.
(2) The premises of any user may be inspected at all reasonable hours
for the purpose of determining whether any violation of this chapter
exists and in an emergency at any time.
(3) When required by the Director, a user of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying nondomestic wastes shall install a suitable
structure(s) together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such structure, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be
§ 28-31 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-32
27:III-8
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The
structure shall be installed by the user at his/her expense and shall
be maintained by him/her so as to be safe and accessible at all
times. Following approval and installation, such structures may not
be removed without the consent of the Director.
(4) If a user refuses to grant the Director entry upon request, the
Director may seek an administrative warrant for an inspection from
any court authorized to issue search warrants under Michigan law.
(5) In an emergency which creates an immediate and substantial
danger to the health, safety, and welfare of individuals or property,
the premises of a user may be inspected at any time and without
permission or a warrant.
B. Monitoring and sampling. Reports required by this chapter shall be
based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report. This data shall be
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
monitoring frequency as established by the Director shall be sufficient to
show compliance with all applicable standards and requirements.
(1) Users shall collect grab samples for pH, cyanide, total phenols, total
petroleum hydrocarbons, oil and greases, sulfide, and volatile
organic compounds to assess compliance, unless otherwise
indicated by the Director. For all other pollutants, users shall collect
flow proportioned composite samples collected over 24 hours or the
duration of the discharge if the duration of the discharge is less than
24 hours, unless otherwise indicated by the Director. Where time
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Director, the samples must be representative of the discharge,
and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented in the industrial user file for that facility (facilities)
using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance. Multiple grab samples
collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics, total petroleum hydrocarbon, and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
(2) For baseline monitoring reports and ninety-day compliance reports,
users shall take a minimum of four grab samples for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data does not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Director may approve a lower minimum. The Director shall require
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.

requirements. However, users may also be subject to citizen suits under
33 U.S.C. 1365 or enforcement actions by the State of Michigan (or
department thereof) or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
B. The City may take any enforcement action at any time as appropriate to
the circumstances of the case. The City is not required to take
enforcement actions in the order in which they are presented in this
section.
A. The Director shall develop and implement an enforcement response
plan. This plan shall contain procedures for investigating and eliminating
noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements. At a
minimum, the plan shall discuss:
(1) How the Director will investigate instances of noncompliance;
(2) The various types of enforcement responses used by the City, the
violations for which the responses will be used, and the timing of
these responses; and
(3) The persons responsible for each response.
B. The enforcement response plan provides only explanatory material and
is merely informational in nature. The enforcement response plan does
not create legal rights or obligations and does not limit the enforcement
discretion of the City.
A. Civil remedies and penalties. A user shall be liable to the City for a civil
infraction and for all costs incurred by the City if:
(1) The user has violated any provision of Chapter 28, the Wastewater
Use Rules and Regulations, local limits, a wastewater discharge
permit, an ICD or an order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement; or
(2) The user's discharge, alone or in conjunction with other
discharge(s), has caused the City to violate any requirement of its
NPDES permit or increased the magnitude or duration of a violation;
or
§ 28-50 RAILROADS § 28-52
27:V-1
(3) An enforcement action against the City by the State of Michigan (or
department thereof), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or
other person results in penalty or other liability being imposed upon
the City as a result of any action by the user.
B. Enforcement actions and penalties. The following enforcement actions or
penalties are applicable to a user who violates Subsection A(1), (2) or (3)
above:
(1) The user is subject to judicial or other equitable injunctive relief for
noncompliance;
(2) The user is deemed to have committed a civil infraction subject to a
civil fine of $1,000 per violation, as required by federal regulations,
or such other maximum fine provided by law in an amount not to
exceed $1,000. Procedures governing the issuance and service of
civil infraction citations shall be governed by applicable state laws
and by Kalamazoo City Code of Ordinances.
(3) The user is subject to relief for noncompliance through
administrative actions up to and including termination of services;
services of SIUs or PIUs that do not comply with their Individual
Control Documents may be terminated;
(4) The user is subject to immediate termination of wastewater system
service in case of emergency to health, safety, welfare, or the
environment, as determined by the Director. The City may seek any
other remedies allowed by law for any violations of this chapter; an
action for civil penalties/remedies is not a bar to or a prerequisite to
taking any other action against a user.
C. Criminal prosecution.
(1) A user who knew or should have known that the user's action or
inaction violates any provision of Chapter 28, the Wastewater Use
Rules and Regulations, local limits, a wastewater discharge permit,
ICD, or an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine up to $500, or imprisonment for
not more than 90 days or both.
(2) A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
chapter, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of up to $500, or imprisonment for
not more than 90 days, or both.
(3) A user who introduces any substance into the wastewater system
which the user knew or should have known would cause personal
injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
§ 28-52 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-52
27:V-2
misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of up to $500 and be
subject to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. This
penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal
injury or property damage available under state law.
D. Violations. The following provisions apply to any violation of this chapter:
(1) A separate violation occurs for each pollutant that exceeds an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement;
(2) Each day on which a violation occurs is a separate violation;
(3) If a user is in noncompliance with any pretreatment standard that is
a monthly average, thirty-day average, or four-day average, then
the user has one violation on each day of the averaging period;
(4) If, for any period, a user has violated both a maximum and an
average pretreatment standard for a particular pollutant, then the
total number of violations is the sum of the days on which the
maximum standard was violated and the days in the averaging
period;
(5) A separate violation occurs on:
(a) Each day that a report is late; and
(b) Each day after an action required to be completed is not
completed.
(6) Making a statement or certification in any application, record,
report, plan, or other document or making a monitoring device or
method inaccurate may result in penalties under the legal remedies
available to the City.
(7) If a user's discharge results in a deposit, obstruction, damage, or an
impairment of the wastewater system, then the user shall be liable
to the City for the costs of cleaning, repairing, or replacing the
affected components as well as other associated fines or costs.
(8) In addition to any fine recovered for a civil infraction, misdemeanor
violation, or administrative penalty, the City may also recover the
costs and fees associated with enforcement activities, including, but
not limited to, the City's costs for sampling analysis, additional
monitoring, investigating, pumping or treating of discharge, lost
revenues or grants, damage or loss to the wastewater system or
public resources, fines and penalties incurred by the City, time
devoted to the action by any City employee or contractual staff and
legal fees and costs incurred by the City. The user shall be notified of
all charges assessed pursuant to this provision.
(9) The City shall give public notice, at least once per year in the largest
daily newspaper published in the area, of all users who have been in
§ 28-52 RAILROADS § 28-52
27:V-3
significant noncompliance at any time during the previous 12
months.
(10) An SIU or PIU may be found to be in violation of its ICD, which may
result in termination of service, for the following reasons:
(a) Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents or other
characteristics of the discharge;
(b) Failure to report changes in wastewater pollutants or other
characteristics;
(c) Failure to submit timely reports;
(d) Failure to allow the Director or his/her representatives
reasonable access to the user's premises for inspection or
monitoring;
(e) Discharging any pollutant prohibited by this chapter;
(f) Discharging a pollutant in excess of the amount allowed in the
ICD or in excess of the amount allowed by this chapter;
(g) Failure to pay the costs imposed upon the user by the Director;
or
(h) Any other violation of the ICD, this chapter, an order of the
Director, a judicial order, or any other applicable local, state, or
federal law.
E. Public nuisance. Every violation of this chapter shall be deemed a public
nuisance.
F. Notice of noncompliance.
(1) If the Director has determined that a user has violated or is violating
this chapter, the Wastewater Use Rules and Regulations, the user's
ICD, local limits, an order, any pretreatment standard or
requirement, or any other applicable local, state, or federal law,
then the Director may issue to the user a notice of noncompliance.
(2) A notice of noncompliance shall identify the violation and the
consequences of further violation.
(3) As appropriate to the circumstances, the notice of noncompliance
may:
(a) Require description of the nature and cause of the violation;
(b) Require a description of the remedy;
(c) Require the submission of certain information before a certain
date;
§ 28-52 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-52
27:V-4
(d) Provide notice that the City will be increasing its surveillance of
the user; or
(e) Contain other provisions that promote a return to compliance.
G. Letter of violation.
(1) If the Director has determined that a user has violated or is violating
this chapter, the Wastewater Use Rules and Regulations, the user's
ICD, local limits, an order, any pretreatment standard or
requirement, or any other applicable local, state, or federal law or
has failed to respond to a notice of compliance, then the Director
may issue to the user a letter of violation.
(2) Any letter of violation issued by the Director shall:
(a) Be written;
(b) Be either hand delivered or delivered by certified mail, return
receipt requested;
(c) State the nature of the violation;
(d) Describe the administrative procedures that are available to
review the Director's determination.
(3) A letter of violation may require the user to:
(a) Attend a meeting with the Director;
(b) Submit a proposed compliance schedule; or
(c) Take other actions to identify the nature of the violation, the
cause of the violation, or a remedy for the violation.
H. Compliance order.
(1) A compliance order may be issued at the discretion of the Director,
and specifically details the method and means a user must follow to
correct violations of this chapter, the Wastewater Use Rules and
Regulations, local limits, ICD, an order, pretreatment standard or
requirement, or any other applicable local, state or federal law, in
order to come into compliance. The order may contain a compliance
schedule detailing time frames within which the user must come
into compliance. The order shall be written, describe the
administrative procedures that are available to review the Director's
determination and be hand delivered or delivered by certified mail,
return receipt requested.
(2) If the user fails to adhere to the compliance order and/or fails to
achieve compliance, the Director shall take further appropriate
action.
§ 28-52 RAILROADS § 28-52
27:V-5
§ 28-53. Administrative review (due process).
(3) If a user acts in full accordance with a compliance schedule, other
than SNC publication, no further enforcement actions need be
issued for parameter violations addressed by the schedule.
I. Notice of administrative penalty. When noncompliance warrants the
exacting of a monetary penalty or cost recovery, the Director may issue
a notice of administrative penalty which may include a compliance order.
J. Show cause order. A show cause order may be issued by the Director.
The show cause order shall direct the user to explain its noncompliance
and show cause why more severe enforcement actions, up to and
including termination of services, should not be carried out.
K. Cessation of discharges. After a user has received notice that the
Director has revoked the user's ICD, the user shall immediately cease all
discharges as required by the Director to the wastewater system, and
the Director shall take all steps necessary to assure that no further such
discharges occur.
L. Effect of director approval of plans, specifications, or operating
procedures. Director approval of plans, specifications, or operating
procedures does not entitle a user to relief from enforcement actions if
the user does not achieve compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements.
A. The administrative review process is available under the following
instances:
(1) Any user aggrieved by a decision of the Director pursuant to this
chapter may request an administrative hearing.
(2) Whenever the Director has reason to believe that any user has
committed or is committing a violation of this chapter, local limits,
the Wastewater Use Rules and Regulations, ICD, an order, or any
pretreatment standard or requirement, or any other applicable local,
state or federal law, or the user has not responded to or corrected
previous violations, the Director may issue a written notice to the
user to appear for an administrative hearing to show cause why
wastewater system service should not be terminated.
(3) In nonemergency situations, enforcement actions involving
termination services will be stayed pending an administrative
hearing.
(4) In emergency situations where wastewater system service is
terminated, the user is entitled to an administrative hearing.
Termination of service is not stayed pending an administrative
hearing. If a user fails to comply with a termination of service, the
City shall take such steps as it deems necessary, including
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage
§ 28-52 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-53
27:V-6
§ 28-54. Affirmative defense.
to the wastewater system, the receiving stream, or endangerment
to individuals.
(5) A request for an administrative hearing is deemed to include an
appeal of permit or ICD conditions. Decisions made after an
administrative hearing, not to reconsider a wastewater discharge
permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify
a wastewater discharge permit, shall be considered final
administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
(6) Where the Director initiates an administrative hearing, a written
notice or show cause order shall be served upon the user by
personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested to the
user's last known address.
B. The administrative hearing shall be conducted by an impartial hearing
officer appointed by the City Manager. The hearing officer will listen to
any oral evidence and review any written documents requested.
Admissibility of evidence at the administrative hearing shall be within
the discretion of the hearing officer. The user shall be entitled to be
represented at the administrative hearing in person or by an attorney at
his/her own expense and shall be entitled to examine witnesses for the
Director and present evidence on his/her own behalf. A record shall be
made of the proceedings, but such record need not be verbatim. The
hearing officer shall render a written decision within 14 days after the
administrative hearing detailing his decision.
C. During the pendency, in any forum of any challenge to a director
decision, a user affected by the decision shall comply with the decision.
A. If the Director brings an action against a user alleging a violation of
Chapter 28, § 28-10B, 28-10C or 28-11A(3) through (7), then the user
may assert as an affirmative defense that:
The user did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone
or in combination with discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference; and
Either:
(a) A Wastewater Use Rule or Regulation designed to prevent pass
through or interference was developed and the user was in
compliance with the Wastewater Use Rule or Regulation
immediately before and during the pass through or interference,
or
§ 28-53 RAILROADS § 28-54
27:V-7
§ 28-55. Upset defense.
§ 28-56. Appeals.
If a user is aggrieved by a decision of the hearing officer, the user shall
have the right to appeal that decision by way of an action for superintending
control in the Kalamazoo County Circuit Court. Such an appeal shall be filed
within 21 days of the decision at issue, and shall be governed by applicable
Michigan Court Rules.
§ 28-57. through § 28-69. (Reserved)
(b) A Wastewater Use Rule or Regulation was not generated or
applicable and immediately before and during the pass through or
interference the user's discharge did not substantially change in
volume or pollutants from the user's previous discharges when the
City was in compliance with its NPDES permit and all applicable
requirements for sludge use or disposal.
A. Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards
because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset
does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
B. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with a categorical pretreatment standard if:
(1) The user demonstrates, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs or other evidence:
(a) The cause of the noncompliance;
(b) That the noncompliance was unintentional and temporary;
(c) That the facility was being operated in a prudent manner in
compliance with all applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
(d) That the noncompliance was caused by factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user and not caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless
or improper operation; and
(e) The user reports the noncompliance according to § 28-31.

Service Charges123
§ 28-70. System to be operated on rate basis.
From and after April 1, 1980, the wastewater system shall be operated and
maintained, on the rate basis as authorized by law and provided for in this
chapter.
§ 28-71. Connection charges.
§ 28-72. To be charged for all connections; basis, meters.
[Amended 3-9-1998 by Ord. No. 1649]
A. The City Manager is hereby authorized, with the consent of the City
Commission, to determine and establish a schedule of construction
charges for the various sizes and types of sanitary sewer connections for
each calendar year. Each schedule shall become effective when
approved by motion duly adopted by the City Commission. Such
schedule of charges shall be based on the following, as applicable:
(1) Recovery of all costs normally incurred for this type of construction.
(2) The size and length of pipe to be used for connection.
(3) Extra costs of construction during winter months.
(4) Repair or replacement of pavement and sidewalk.
(5) Exceptional surface repairs, including landscaping.
B. The Director may establish advance deposits for sanitary sewer
connection construction charges for each calendar year.
(1) Advance deposits toward sanitary sewer connection construction
charges established under this section shall be made before
construction. Any balance owed shall be due within 30 days after
billing. Interest at the rate of 1% per month shall be charged upon
any delinquent unpaid balance. If such unpaid balance, with
interest, is not paid within six months, that fact shall be reported to
the City Commission for the establishment for a lien against the real
estate.
A. The rates to be charged for wastewater service furnished by the
wastewater system shall be charged to all buildings or premises having
any connection with the system. Such rates shall be based upon the
water consumption of the user's premises, including water from public
and private supplies, or at the election of the user, the amount of
123. Editor's Note: Ord. No. 1649, adopted 3-9-1998, amended Art. VI, Service Charges, by
changing §§ 28-72 through 28-80 back to the language in effect prior to the adoption of
Ord. No. 1639 on 6-30-1997.

wastewater discharged into the wastewater system, except that the
service charge shall be based upon the size of the water meter.
B. The owner of any building or premises receiving water from any source
other than the City water department shall register the same with the
Director and shall arrange to have suitable metering facilities installed at
his own expense to measure such private supply. The meters shall be
provided, maintained, and read by the water department, for which the
customer shall be charged the applicable water service charge in
addition to the established charges for wastewater services. In any
interim period allowed by the Director prior to such installation, the
Director may establish such charges as he deems equitable, considering
the anticipated wastewater discharge.
C. Any user of the wastewater system may elect to rearrange his water
supply pipes and metering, for the purpose of eliminating from the total
water consumption applicable to wastewater charges the water not
running to the sanitary sewers, or he may elect to establish metering
facilities registering the discharge from his premises to the sanitary
sewers. All such arrangements shall be made subject to the approval of
the Director, and the expense thereof, including installation,
maintenance, and operation, shall be borne by the user.
D. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the City for treatment. Any user who
enters into a special agreement or arrangement with the City shall be
subject to all user and industrial costs or fees established in the special
agreement. No special agreement shall be entered into which is in
conflict with Section 307 of Public Law 92-500 or with any other local,
state, or federal law or regulation.
A. Each user of the treatment works shall pay charges equal to the sum of
those set out in Subsections A(1) and (2) below, according to the service
charge (meter reading, billing expense, and allocated infiltration/inflow
costs) in Subsection A(1) and the commodity charge (quantity of
wastewater at average domestic strength and septic haulers at higher
strengths as indicated) in Subsection A(2). For nonmaster metered
municipal (wholesale) customers (City of Galesburg and a portion of the
City of Portage), the commodity charge has been increased above the
master metered municipal (wholesale) customer class to account for
infiltration and inflow.
§ 28-72 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-73
27:VI-2
Commercial or industrial users whose wastewater strengths are
monitored and tested by City technical services staff shall pay quantity/
quality charges (quantity, BOD, SS and NH3) in Subsection A(3) below.
Any commercial or industrial user who is not monitored by City technical
services staff, and who believes that their wastewater strengths are
below average domestic wastewater strengths (BOD - 239 mg/l, SS - 259
mg/l, NH3 - 18.3 mg/l) may document their wastewater strengths to the
satisfaction of the Director (or pay the cost of sampling and testing by
City technical services staff) and shall be allowed to pay quantity/quality
rates in Subsection A(3) below.
Septage haulers whose wastewater strengths are below the amounts in
the above paragraph may document their wastewater strengths to the
satisfaction of the Director (or pay the cost of sampling and testing by
City technical services staff) and shall be allowed to pay quantity/quality
rates in Subsection A(3) below.
(1) Service charges. The following service charges shall apply to all
users connected or required to be connected regardless of quantity
of wastewater discharged. The service charge is a user charge, and
it contains billing and inflow and infiltration charges for retail
customers. For municipal (wholesale) customers with a master
meter, the service charge contains billing costs only since inflow and
infiltration are included in their metered flow.

B. In addition to the above charges, each user shall pay the charges for
miscellaneous service and monitoring, as determined by the Director.
The charges may be revised by the Director whenever, in her/his
opinion, it is deemed appropriate. All charges shall be paid to the
Department of Public Services, and all funds received as result of the
miscellaneous charges will be credited to the wastewater system
receiving account.
C. Any person or entity who is responsible for discharging prohibited
material shall be charged the actual expense incurred by the City for
handling, treatment and/or removal of said material in the wastewater
system.
D. Any user who is responsible for damage to the wastewater system shall
be charged the full cost of repair of damage to the wastewater system.
The cost shall include, but is not limited to, labor, equipment, materials,
and administrative expense, interest on borrowed funds, engineering,
legal, or other professional fees or expenses charged to the City by other
utilities or departments and any and all fines, costs, penalties, or
damages imposed upon the City by the United States, the State of
Michigan, or any court or administrative agency.
E. Users will be notified at least once per year how much they are being
charged for their proportional operation, maintenance, and replacement
costs, as required by United States Environmental Protection Agency
regulations.
F. The rates established by this amendment shall go into effect for
wastewater bills rendered on or after February 14, 2019.
§ 28-73 RAILROADS § 28-74
27:VI-7
A. Users of the treatment works shall be divided into classes. Classes shall
be groups of users for which the wastewater characteristics are
approximately equal and services provided are essentially the same.
Classes and subclasses of users are hereby established for capital
charges as follows:
NONINDUSTRIAL USER CLASS
a. Individual metered
a.1 Inside City
a.2 Outside City
b. Master metered
b.1 Outside City
c. Individual metered
c.1 Inside City
c.2 Outside City
d. Contract industries served by Riverview Pumping Station.
e. Contract industries not served by Riverview Pumping Station.
The user charges shall result in the distribution of operation,
maintenance, and replacement costs of the wastewater system within
the jurisdiction of the City to each user class in proportion to such user's
contribution of the total wastewater loading of the treatment works.
Factors such as strength, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics
shall be included to ensure a proportional distribution of the costs.
The Director may establish additional classes as are determined to be
necessary.
B. The demand charge provided in § 28-73A applicable to single-family
residences within the individually metered nonindustrial class shall be
computed on the basis of the size of the water meter actually on the
water service to the residence.
C. The commodity user charge provided in § 28-73B for individually
metered users in both the industrial and nonindustrial classes and the
contract industrial users shall include the cost of treating wastewater
with a level of pollutants up to and including 250 mg/l BOD5; or 625 mg/l
COD and 290 mg/l SS. The commodity user charge provided in § 28-73B
for master metered users in both the industrial and nonindustrial classes
shall include the cost of treating wastewater with a level of pollutants up
to and including 250 mg/l BOD5 and 290 mg/l SS.
D. Residential customers and other small users whose water consumption
as purchased from the water department is less than 200 cubic meters
during the winter quarter shall be billed for wastewater service in the
other three quarters on the basis of the actual consumption of water with
a maximum quantity for any quarter equal to 120% of the winter quarter.
The winter quarter is defined as a three-month billing period between
November first of any one year and April thirtieth of the subsequent year
§ 28-74 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-74
27:VI-8
§ 28-75. Applicability of demand charge to property not connected
to sewer. [Amended 3-9-1998 by Ord. No. 1649]
Properties which have water service or a water supply and abut a sanitary
sewer and have not been connected thereto shall become liable for payment
of the demand charge prescribed in § 28-73 upon the expiration of a fiveyear
period following the date when the sanitary sewer was accepted by the
City as being ready for use.
§ 28-76. (Reserved)
§ 28-77. Billing; responsibility for payment. [Amended 3-9-1998 by
Ord. No. 1649]
Wastewater service charges shall be billed quarterly, except that customers
billed monthly for water shall be billed monthly for the wastewater service
charge. The person paying or responsible for payment of the water bill shall,
in like manner, be responsible for payment of the wastewater service bill.
§ 28-78. When due and payable; penalty and interest for
delinquency. [Amended 3-9-1998 by Ord. No. 1649]
All charges for wastewater service shall become due and payable on the
date indicated on each bill. Payment made after such date shall include an
additional 5% of the amount due on the due date.
§ 28-79. Charges as lien; collection by suit, discontinuing
wastewater service for failure to pay. [Amended 3-9-1998 Ord. No.
1649; 1-20-2015 by Ord. No. 1931]
(both dates inclusive) in accordance with water meter reading and billing
schedules as used by the water department. Where is evident that the
water consumption during the winter quarter does not fairly reflect the
yearly consumption for nonsprinkling purposes, the Director may use
such three-month period or average as reasonably appears to reflect
normal waste after discharge from that residence as a basis for the
wastewater disposal service bill. All other users shall be billed on a
basis of water actually used in every billing period or actual wastewater
discharged through a meter.
A. The charges for wastewater service are hereby recognized to constitute
a lien on the premises receiving such service. This lien shall become
effective immediately upon providing wastewater service to the
premises but shall be not enforceable for more than three years after it
becomes effective. Whenever any such charge against any property
shall be delinquent for three months, the City officials in charge of the
collection thereof may certify to the tax assessing officer of the City the
fact of such delinquency, whereupon such charge shall be entered upon
the next roll as a charge against such premises and shall be collected
and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general City taxes
§ 28-74 RAILROADS § 28-79
27:VI-9
§ 28-80. Disposition of revenue. [Amended 3-9-1998 by Ord. No.
1649]
against such premises are collected and the lien thereof enforced.
Nothing in this section, however, shall be deemed to prevent the City
from suing in a court of law to collect the amount due it for wastewater
service charges as provided in Subsection C below. In addition to the
other remedies provided in this section, the City shall have the right to
shut off and discontinue the supply of water service to any premises for
the nonpayment of wastewater service charges when due in accordance
with the procedure established in Subsection B below.
B. If a charge for wastewater service prescribed by this article is not paid
within 30 days after the billing therefor, and after the customer has been
given notice and an opportunity to be heard as provided by law, all water
service may be shut off and discontinued to the customer owing or liable
for such charge. Water service shut off pursuant to this section shall not
be restored until all sums due and owing have been paid in full, including
a collection fee of $10 and appropriate security deposits as prescribed
by resolution of the City Commission.
C. At its option the City may, in addition to the remedies above, in its
corporate name, bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
collection of any wastewater service charge which, 30 days after the
billing therefor, has not paid. The production of the meter record or cost
record shall be prima facie evidence of the liability to pay the amount
therein shown to be due.
A. The revenues of the wastewater system derived from the collection of
rates established by this article are hereby ordered to be credited, as
collected, to a separate account to be designated as the wastewater
system receiving account (hereinafter referred to as the receiving
account) and the revenues in such account shall be credited to the
following accounts quarterly in the manner hereinafter specified for the
purposes therein mentioned. The revenues of the wastewater system
may be deposited in such bank accounts and with such depositories as
the City Commission may, by resolution or ordinance designate.
B. Out of the revenue in the receiving account, there shall be credited
quarterly to a separate account, designated as the operation and
maintenance account, all funds collected from user charges to be used
for the administration and operation of the system, including billing,
accounting, postage and related costs, and such current expenses for
the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in
good repair and working order.
C. There shall next be established and maintained a separate account,
designated as the debt retirement account, which account shall be used
solely and only for the purpose of paying the principal of an interest on
the bonds of the system as are now or may hereafter be issued, except
special assessment bonds. Any tax revenues designated for use in
§ 28-79 KALAMAZOO CODE § 28-80
27:VI-10
§ 28-81. through § 28-90. (Reserved)
retiring such bonds shall likewise be credited to this account as and
when received. There shall be set aside from time to time in such
account at least a sufficient amount to meet the principal and interest
requirements accruing in the current fiscal year.
D. After all such funds have been credited as above provided, the revenues
derived from the charges collected and taxes designated as aforesaid
may be used for the purpose of construction, expansion, extension and
improvement of the system.
E. Any surplus "capital charge" revenues remaining at the end of any fiscal
year, after the above requirements have been met, shall be credited to
the system surplus account and shall be disposed of as directed by the
City Commission.

§ 29-4. Discharge prohibitions.
A. Prohibition of illicit discharges.
(1) A person shall not discharge, directly or indirectly, any pollutant into
the City's stormwater system, except in quantities expressly
authorized by an approved NPDES permit or by a plan for
compliance, or that are consistent with the utilization of best
management practices.
(2) A person shall not improperly store, handle, or apply any pollutant in
a manner that will cause its exposure to rainfall or runoff or
otherwise cause it to discharge into the stormwater system, except
in quantities explicitly authorized by an approved NPDES permit or
by a plan for compliance, or that are consistent with the utilization of
best management practices.
(3) The following shall not be deemed to be an illegal discharge (unless
identified by the Department as a source of pollutants or deemed to
be an interference to the proper operation and maintenance of the
stormwater drainage system):
(a) Water supply line flushing, landscape irrigation runoff, diverted
stream flows, rising groundwaters, uncontaminated
groundwater infiltration [as defined by 40 CFR 35.2005 (20)],
§ 29-2 RAILROADS § 29-4

specifically authorized by NPDES permits), discharges from
potable water sources, foundation drains, air conditioning
condensate, irrigation water, springs, water from crawl space
pumps, footing drains and basement sump pumps, lawn
watering runoff, waters from noncommercial car washing, flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands, and residual street wash
waters, discharges or flows from emergency fire fighting
activities;
(b) Residential swimming pool discharges so long as the pool
waters have been effectively de-chlorinated (less than 0.5 parts
per million chlorine) and so long as the discharge does not occur
during times of heavy rains (nonresidential/commercial
swimming pools are regulated under Chapter 34, Swimming
Pools, of the Kalamazoo Code and Chapter 28, Wastewater
Discharge Regulations and Enforcement Procedures);
(c) Discharges specified by the Department as being necessary to
protect public health and safety;
(d) Dye testing using MDEQ or Department approved dyes, so long
as preceded by a written notification to and approval from the
Department; and

discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency or MDEQ, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the
permit or order, and other applicable laws and regulations, and
provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the stormwater system.
(4) No person shall place any material in or around any stormwater
system component, including catch basins, inlets, manholes,
culverts, pipes, or natural watercourse, if such material acts to
significantly obstruct or clog the stormwater system or stormwater
flow. This prohibition shall not apply to the temporary placement of
material as acceptable and consistent with official City material
collection programs and policies (such as leaf or brush pickups).
(5) A person may not discharge fluids into or towards the stormwater
system if such discharge accumulates and freezes on a street or
sidewalk, or is reasonably likely to do so.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.

Any person subject to a NPDES stormwater discharge permit, City of
Kalamazoo soil erosion and sedimentation control permit, or City of
Kalamazoo site plan review shall comply with all provisions of such permit
or approvals. Proof of compliance with said permits or approvals may be
required in a form acceptable to the Department prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 29-7. Monitoring of discharges.
(7) Maintaining records of new structures and substantially improved
structures concerning any certificates of floodproofing, lowest floor
elevation, basements, floodproofing, and elevations to which
structures have been floodproofed.
D. In conjunction with this section, the City has adopted a "Resolution to
Manage Floodplain Development for the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP)," and may from time to time adopt other resolutions in
order for the city to continue to participant in the NFIP.
A. Access to facilities.
(1) As a condition to having a connection to the City's stormwater
system, an industrial or commercial facility shall permit the
Department to enter and inspect at reasonable times and in a
reasonable manner to determine compliance with this chapter. Such
entry and inspection may include but not be limited to sampling,
analysis, dye testing, smoke testing, remote video inspection
(Tving), and examination and/or copying of records that are required
by this chapter to be maintained.
(2) The Department may require a commercial or industrial facility that
discharges into the City's stormwater system to install devices as
are reasonably necessary to monitor and/or sample the facility's
stormwater discharge. In the alternative, and at the City's option,
the City may install such devices. All such devices shall be
calibrated to ensure accuracy.
(3) The City is hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of
competent jurisdiction in obtaining entry to a facility if the
Department has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater originates and/or is discharged, and if the
Department is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community. In addition, or in the
alternative, the Department, if denied entry, may terminate the

pollutants by the use of best management practices.
§ 29-9. Notification of spills.
facility's connection to the stormwater system. Such termination
must be preceded by written notice to the facility of such intent.
A. If the owner or operator of a facility does not provide reasonable
protection from illicit discharge, the Department may require best
management practices (BMPs) and/or stormwater pollution prevention
plans (SWPPPs) for a facility that discharges, or is reasonably suspected
of discharging, pollution into the stormwater system, at the facility's
expense. A BMP shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
most current MDEQ Guidebook of BMPs for Michigan Watersheds, or
equivalent practices and design criteria that accomplish the purposes of
this chapter, as approved by the Department. A BMP and/or a SWPPP,
which may be imposed even if the facility is subject to a NPDES permit,
shall be communicated in writing by the Department to the facility.
B. If the facility believes all or a portion of the BMP or SWPPP is
unreasonable, it may appeal it to the Department Director. Such an
appeal must be in writing and must be received by the Department
Director within 14 days of when the BMP and/or SWPPP notification is
received by the facility. In the absence of such an appeal, the facility
shall implement the BMP and/or SWPPP before the deadline stipulated by
the Department in the original written notification regarding the BMP
requirement. If an appeal is denied, the facility shall implement the BMP
and/or SWPPP within a deadline stipulated by the Department in the
appeal denial notification letter. The required BMP implementation time
period will be based on the severity of the specific situation and may
range from one day to 45 days.
A. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility, has information of a release, or suspected release, of pollutants
into the stormwater system, said person shall take all reasonable and
necessary steps to discover, contain, and clean up such release,
including, if necessary, contacting emergency response agencies. Said
person shall also notify the Department of the discharge either in
person, by telephone, or by facsimile as soon as possible, but in no event
more than six hours after learning of the release.
B. All spill notifications provided to the Department in person or by
telephone shall be documented by said person in writing and mailed to
the Department within five business days of said incident. Such written
notice shall specify the following: the composition of the discharge and
the cause thereof; the exact date, time, and estimated volume of the
discharge; all measures taken to clean up the discharge, and all
measures proposed to be taken to reduce and prevent any recurrence;
§ 29-7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 29-9
27:20
§ 29-10. Records, reports, sampling and analysis.
A facility shall prepare and maintain records and/or conduct such testing
and analysis as deemed necessary by the Department to insure compliance
with a BMP or a SWPPP. The facility shall make such records and test results
available to the Department upon request. The owner or operator shall retain
a copy of the written notice, all books, drawings, plans, prints, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, and records, including records on
magnetic or electronic media, and any and all summaries of such records
relating to monitoring, sampling, and chemical analysis of any discharge or
stormwater runoff from any property for at least five years.

the name and telephone number of the person making the report, and
the name of the person who may be contacted for additional information
on the matter. The person shall also provide the Department with copies
of all documents the person submits to state or federal agencies relating
to the same release.
A. Whenever the Department finds that a person has violated a provision of
this chapter, the Department may order compliance by issuing a written
notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require
one or more of the following:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of an illicit connection or discharge;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
(5) The abatement and correction of any degradation of riparian habitat
and aquatic life caused by the failure to design, install, operate, or
maintain sediment control, stormwater management, or agricultural
BMPs in accordance with an approved sediment control plan,
stormwater plan, sediment control permit, Soil Conservation and
Quality Plan, or plan for compliance;
(6) The reimbursement to the City in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the City for all reasonable administrative and remediation costs; and
(7) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work may be done by the Department, with the
expense thereof charged to the violator.

§ 29-14. Abatement activities by Department.
A. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination
to the Department Director. The notice of appeal must be received by
the Director within 30 days from the date of the notice of violation and
identify the matter being appealed and the basis for the appeal. The
Director shall address the appeal within 30 days from the date of receipt
of the notice of appeal. The Director will consider the appeal and make a
decision whereby it affirms, rejects, or modifies the action being
appealed. In considering any such appeal, the Director may consider the
recommendations of its staff and the comments of other persons having
knowledge of the matter.
B. In considering all such appeals, the Director may grant a variance from
the terms of this chapter so as to provide relief, in whole or in part from
the action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following
requirements are satisfied:
(1) The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause unreasonable difficulties for a facility; and
(2) The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent
the goals and purposes sought to be accomplished by this chapter
from being accomplished, nor result in less effective management of
stormwater runoff.
A. The Department may, after providing written notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person in violation of this chapter. Written notice
shall describe the nature of the violation and the action necessary to
correct the violation. If the violation continues for 10 calendar days after
the notice was sent, the Department may suspend MS4 discharge
access.
B. The Department may suspend MS4 discharge access to a person in
violation of this chapter, without prior notice, when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents an
imminent and substantial danger to the City's stormwater system or to
the environment.
A. The Department may perform reasonable and necessary abatement
activities whenever the Department determines a violation of this
chapter has occurred and it appears that the responsible party cannot or
will not timely perform said activities, or when no known responsible
party exists. The responsible party shall reimburse the City for all
reasonable expenses thus incurred.
B. If the City desires the responsible party to reimburse it for reasonable
abatement activity expenses, the City shall, within 90 days of the

If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter,
the Department may petition the appropriate court for injunctive relief
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations,
or compelling the person to perform necessary abatement or remediation.
§ 29-16. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the
violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel
the cessation of such nuisance may be taken by the City.
§ 29-17. Criminal prosecution.
Any person who violates this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment of not more than
90 days. Each day a violation exists shall be deemed a separate violation.

The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state, or local law and it is within the
discretion of the Department to seek cumulative remedies.
completion of said activities, mail to that person a notice of claim
outlining the expenses incurred, including reasonable administrative
costs, and the amounts thereof. The person billed shall pay said sum in
full within 30 days of receipt of the claim. If the person billed desires
to object to all or some of the amount sought by the Department, said
person may file, within the same thirty-day period, a written objection
so stating. The Department shall, within 30 days of its receipt of the
objection, provide an opportunity for the objecting party to present facts
or arguments supporting said objection. If the Department determines
that some or all of the amount originally billed is appropriate, the person
shall pay said sum within 30 days of receipt of that determination. If
the amount due is not timely paid, the City may cause the charges to
become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute
a lien on the property.

§ 32-1. Title. [Adm. Code § A600.1]
This chapter shall be known as the "Special Assessment Ordinance" and it
may be referred to and cited as such.
§ 32-2. Definitions. [Adm. Code § A600.2]
The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the meanings herein
ascribed to them:
COST — When referring to the cost of any improvement, shall include the
cost of surveys, plans, land, right-of-way, spreading of rolls, notices,
advertising, legal and financial advice, financing and construction and all
other costs incident to the making of such improvement, the special
assessment therefor and the financing thereof.
IMPROVEMENT — Any public improvement, the whole or any part of the cost
of which is assessable against one or more lots or parcels of land especially
benefited thereby, in proportion to the benefit to be derived therefrom.
§ 32-3. General authority of Commission. [Adm. Code § A600.3]
The City Commission is hereby empowered to determine that the whole
or any part of the cost of any improvement shall be defrayed by special
assessments upon the property specially benefited, and assessments may
be levied before, during or after construction.
§ 32-4. Property owners' petition. [Adm. Code § A600.4]
The Commission, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable number
of property owners to be assessed desire any particular improvement to be
made, may request and receive a petition therefor, or may receive such
a petition voluntarily presented, but in either event, such petition shall be
advisory only and shall not be jurisdictional, except in cases where such a
§ 31-25 KALAMAZOO CODE § 32-4
32:4
petition is specifically made jurisdictional by the statutes of the state. Such
petition shall be submitted on forms approved by the City Manager and
shall be furnished by the City. The City shall not be required to construct
any improvement petitioned for, and the City may proceed to construct an
improvement without a petition having been filed or without 51% having
signed the petition.
§ 32-5. Preliminary proceedings. [Adm. Code § A600.5]
The Commission shall, by resolution, require the City Manager to prepare
such maps, diagrams or plans as will indicate the scope of any improvement,
any part of the cost of which is to be defrayed by special assessment, and
an estimate or tabulation of the cost thereof, and to file the same with the
City Clerk, together with his recommendation as to what proportion of the
cost should be paid by special assessment and what part, if any, should be
borne by the City at large and the land which should be included in the
special assessment district. After the report is filed with the Clerk, it shall be
presented to the Commission and shall be available for public examination.
Whenever any land which should be included in the special assessment
district may not be assessable for any reason, a written agreement may be
reached providing for the payment of the owner's share of the cost of the
improvement. Whenever any property is acquired for the purpose of any
improvement, the cost thereof and of the proceedings required to acquire
such property may be added to the cost of such improvement.
§ 32-6. Commission determination; direction to prepare roll. [Adm.
Code § A600.6]
After the City Manager's report is presented to the Commission pursuant
to § 32-5, the Commission may, by resolution, approve the maps, diagrams
or plans and the estimate or tabulation of cost; authorize or ratify the
improvement; determine the estimated life of such improvement; determine
what proportion of such cost shall be paid by special assessment upon the
property especially benefited and what part, if any, shall be borne by the City
at large; the number of annual installments in which the assessments may be
paid; the interest to be charged; designate the district or land and premises
upon which special assessments shall be levied; and direct the Assessor
to prepare a special assessment roll in accordance with the Commission's
determination.
§ 32-7. Preparation of roll generally. [Adm. Code § A600.8]
When so directed by the Commission, the City Assessor shall prepare a
special assessment roll, including all lots and parcels of land within the
special assessment district designated by the Commission, and shall assess
to each such lot or parcel of land such relative portion of the whole sum to
be levied against the special assessment district as shall be proportionate to
the benefit to such lot or parcel of land resulting from the improvement. If,
by mistake or otherwise, any person shall be improperly designated as the
owner of any lot or parcel of land, or if it is assessed without the name of the
§ 32-4 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR PUBLIC § 32-7
32:5
owner, or in the name of a person other than the owner, such assessment
shall not, for any such cause, be vitiated, but shall, in all respects, be as valid
upon and against such lot or parcel of land and the true owner as though
assessed in the name of the proper owner.
§ 32-8. Preparation of roll after completion of improvement. [Adm.
Code § A600.7]
Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, the City Commission may,
in its discretion, delay the preparation of a special assessment roll, together
with its determination of the portion of costs to be assessed, the number of
installments and land included in the district, until after the completion of the
improvement, in which case the actual cost thereof shall be reported to the
Commission and a special assessment roll shall then be made, based upon
such actual cost pursuant to its determinations.
§ 32-9. Corner lot formula and assessment line for sewer
improvements; payment as prerequisite to sewer connection. [P.S.
Code § PS302.5]
All property adjoining or abutting on any street or alley through which or
along which a main sewer shall be built or extended, or in which a main
sewer shall be built, shall be assessed for the cost of such improvement as
the City Commission shall, by resolution, direct, according to the provisions
of the Charter and this chapter; provided that no corner lot having an
aggregate frontage of 198 feet or less on streets or alleys shall be assessed
on more than half the sum of the frontage on said streets or alleys for
lateral and main sewer construction, and no corner lot having a greater
aggregate frontage of more than 198 feet in the street or alley shall be
assessed for main or lateral sewer construction on a greater number of feet
than is obtained by adding the several frontages on the streets and alleys,
and deducting 99 feet from the total thereof; and further provided, that a
corner lot shall be deemed to be land held under one ownership, without
reference to any subdivision as made in plats. Frontage for assessments shall
be computed along an assessment line parallel to the street or alley rightof-
way line. In zoning districts 7, 7A and 8, the aforementioned assessment
line shall be located 25 feet from the street right-of-way line. In zoning
districts 5, 5A, 5B and 6, the assessment line shall be located 15 feet from
the street right-of-way line. In zoning districts 1 through 4, inclusive, and
for purposes of the application of the corner lot formula as hereinbefore
described, the assessment line shall coincide with the street right-of-way
line.127 Such assessments or installments due shall be paid in full before a
permit shall be issued for connecting said property with a main or lateral
sewer, unless otherwise provided by the City Commission.
127. Editor's Note: See App. A, Zoning Ordinance, § 2.1, for current zoning districts.
§ 32-7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 32-10
32:6
§ 32-10. Assessment line for street improvements. [P.S. Code
§ PS301.32(a)]
All property adjoining or abutting on any street or alley graded, paved or
otherwise improved shall be assessed for the cost of such improvement, as
the City Commission shall, by resolution, direct, according to the provisions
of the Charter and this chapter. Frontage for assessments shall be computed
along an assessment line parallel to the street or alley right-of-way line.
In zoning districts 7, 7A and 8, the assessment line shall be located 25
feet from the street right-of-way line. In zoning districts 5, 5A and 6, the
assessment line shall be located 15 feet from the street right-of-way line. In
zoning districts 1 through 4 inclusive, the assessment line shall coincide with
the street right-of-way line. Where pavement and curb and gutter have been
constructed and/or assessed along one side of a corner lot prior to July 30,
1973, credit for the appropriate frontage differential resulting from use of the
aforementioned assessment line shall be given to corner properties in special
assessment rolls confirmed after such date.
§ 32-11. Certification and filing of roll. [Adm. Code § 600.9]
When the Assessor has completed the assessment roll, he shall attach
thereto his certificate to the effect that the roll has been made by him
pursuant to a resolution of the City Commission, giving the date thereof,
and that, in making the assessment therein, he has, as near as may be and
according to his best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions
contained in such resolution and to the Charter and this chapter. Thereupon,
the Assessor shall file, in the office of the City Clerk, a copy of the
assessment roll and certificate, and it shall be available for public inspection.
§ 32-12. Fixing time and place for hearing; notice of hearing. [Adm.
Code § A600.10]
Upon receipt of an assessment roll and certificate by the Clerk, the
Commission shall fix a time and place when it will meet and review such
roll and shall direct the City Clerk to give notice of such hearing. The notice
shall specify the time and place of the hearing and shall be sent by the City
Clerk, by first-class mail, to each owner of property subject to assessment
in accordance with law. Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, the
Clerk shall insert a return addressed, postage prepaid response card with
such notice, inviting the recipient's comments on the project and assessment
and requiring him to sign his name and address thereon. When so directed
by the Commission, the Clerk shall also publish the notice.
§ 32-13. Conduct of hearing; objections to roll; Commission action
on roll. [Adm. Code §§ A600.10-A600.12]
A. The hearing required by § 32-12 may be held at any regular, adjourned
or special meeting of the City Commission, provided the time therefor is
specified in the required notice, and such hearing may be adjourned
from time to time. At such hearing, all interested persons or parties shall
§ 32-10 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR PUBLIC § 32-13
32:7
§ 32-14. Assessments as lien. [Adm. Code § A600.13]
All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll shall, from
the date of confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective
lots or parcels of land assessed and, until paid, shall be a charge against
the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land. Such lien shall
be of the same character and effect as the lien created for City taxes and
shall include accrued interest, collection fees and penalties. No judgment or
decree, nor any act of the Commission vacating a special assessment, shall
destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises assessed for such
amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same,
or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon.
§ 32-15. Collection. [Adm. Code §§ A600.15, A600.16, A600.20]
be given an opportunity to be heard. The City Assessor, with a copy
of the assessment roll, and the City Manager shall be present at such
hearing.
B. Persons deeming themselves aggrieved by a special assessment roll
shall appear at the hearing provided for in this section or shall file their
objections thereto in writing with the City Clerk prior to the close of such
hearing or any adjournments thereof. Such objections shall specify, in
detail, in what respect the objectors deem themselves aggrieved.
C. At the hearing conducted under this section, the Commission shall
review the special assessment roll and shall consider any written
objections thereto. The Commission may correct the roll as to any
assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land, or other errors
appearing therein. Any changes made in such roll shall be noted in the
Commission's minutes. After such hearing and review, the Commission
may confirm such special assessment roll with such corrections as it may
have made, if any, or may refer it back to the Assessor for revisions or
may annul it and any proceedings in connection therewith. Upon
confirmation of any special assessment roll, the Commission shall
determine the due date thereof, the number, if any, of annual
installments in which it may be paid, not exceeding 20, establish the rate
of interest chargeable on the unpaid balance from and after the due
date, and establish penalties for late payment. Where installment
payment is permitted, the Commission may establish a collection fee not
exceeding 5% of the unpaid balance to compensate for the accounting
services required. The Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation on
each special assessment roll.
A. The special assessment roll shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the
Treasurer for collection, immediately after its confirmation. The Treasurer
shall divide the assessments into installments, when so ordered by the
Commission; provided that, if such division operates to make any
installment less than $10, then the Treasurer shall reduce the number of
installments so that each installment shall be above and as near $10 as
§ 32-13 KALAMAZOO CODE § 32-15
32:8
§ 32-16. Deficiency assessments and refunds. [Adm. Code
§ A600.18]
Should the assessments in any special assessment roll prove insufficient for
any reason to pay the assessed portion of the cost of the improvement,
the Commission may make additional assessments against the several lots
and parcels of land within the special assessment district to supply the
deficiency, or the Commission may determine that such deficiency shall be
paid in part by the City. Should the assessments levied prove to be more
than necessary to defray costs of the improvements, the Commission may,
by resolution, order the excess, if less than 5% of the total project costs, to
be transferred to the general fund, but if more than such amount, the whole
excess shall be refunded to the then owners of the premises involved, as
their names appear upon the City tax rolls. The excess shall be determined
within one year following the completion of construction and refunds shall
first be applied as payments upon unpaid installments in the inverse order of
the due dates thereof.
§ 32-17. Reassessment in event of illegality. [Adm. Code § A600.19]
Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Commission,
be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
possible. The Treasurer shall mail statements of the several assessments
to the respective owners, as indicated by the roll and the records of the
Treasurer of the several parcels of land assessed, stating the amount
of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid; provided,
however, that failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate the
assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to
pay the assessment.
B. The Treasurer shall be charged with collecting all special assessments.
After an assessment or any installment becomes delinquent, he may add
the entire assessment, with any interest, collection fee or penalty, to the
annual tax bill of the City attributable to the lot or premises involved, or
he may collect it separately by the tax sale procedure provided in the
Charter.
C. In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor,
any delinquent special assessment, together with interest, collection
fees and penalties, may be collected in an action at law in the name of
the City against the person assessed or liable for the same, in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. If in any such action it shall appear that, by
reason of any irregularities or informalities, the assessment has not been
properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be
charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense
has been incurred by the City, which is a proper charge against the
defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the amount
properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.
§ 32-15 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR PUBLIC § 32-17
32:9
the Commission shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or
whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to
cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the
former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for
the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided
for in the original assessment, and whenever the assessment, or any part
thereof, levied upon any premises has been so set aside, if the same has
been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon
the reassessment and the reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed
satisfied.
§ 32-18. Division or combination of lots after assessment
confirmed. [Adm. Code § A600.17]
Should any parcels of land be divided or combined after a special assessment
thereon has been confirmed, and before the assessment has been fully
paid, the Assessor shall, as promptly as possible, apportion the uncollected
amounts upon the several descriptions so divided or combined and report
the same to the City Commission. Such report, as an amendment of the
original lien, when confirmed by the City Commission, shall be conclusive
upon all parties and parcels, and all assessments thereafter made upon such
land shall be according to such new description.
§ 32-19. Single-lot assessments. [Adm. Code § A600.14]
When any expense shall have been incurred by the City upon or in respect
to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against such premises
and the owner thereof under the provisions of the Charter or any ordinance
of the City or law of the state, and is not of the class required to be prorated
among several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district, an
account of the costs or the labor, material or services for which such expense
was incurred, verified by the City Manager, with a description of the lot and
the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the City Treasurer,
who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if known. Such bill shall be
sent by first-class mail to the owner of the property to be assessed and such
bill shall notify such owner of the time of the meeting of the Commission,
not sooner than 10 days thereafter, when the Commission will meet for
the purpose of adopting a resolution confirming a special assessment upon
such property for such charges, unless the same are paid prior to the date
of such meeting. Upon adoption of such resolution, the Commission may
establish a due date, authorize installment payments, and establish interest
collection fees and penalties for late payment as provided for in this chapter.
Immediately after the adoption of such resolution, the Treasurer shall give
notice of the amount so determined to the several persons chargeable
therewith. Such notice shall be sent by first-class mail to the last known
addresses of such persons as shown on the assessment roll of the City, or
by publication. Such notice shall state the basis of the assessment and the
amount thereof, and shall give a reasonable time, not less than 15 days,
within which payment shall be made to the Treasurer. In all cases where
payment is not made within the time set, the assessment shall become
§ 32-17 KALAMAZOO CODE § 32-19
32:10
collectible as any special assessment. The resolution referred to in this
section shall be treated as the confirmation of a special assessment roll.

the City, in good repair. Any owner or occupant of any such premises
who shall allow any such sidewalk to remain out of repair, or in
dangerous condition, without properly barricading the same, shall be
deemed responsible for a municipal civil infraction. [Amended

hazardous, breaking up or deteriorated, it may proceed as herein
provided. It shall adopt a resolution identifying the sidewalk so found,
require the replacement or repair thereof as a public necessity, and

32:VII-2

shall be the same as for the original revocable franchise.
A. A revocable franchise shall remain in effect for a term of five years
commencing upon the date it is executed by the City.
B. All such revocable franchises shall be nonexclusive and non-assignable;
by issuing a revocable franchise, the City does not agree to restrict the
number of revocable franchises in all or part of the City.
C. The revocable franchise shall not limit or modify any other revocable
franchise, license or revocable franchise previously granted by the City
to any other occupant of the rights-of-way.
D. All revocable franchises shall be revocable by the City Commission for

to an unreasonable duplication of existing facilities owned by local
utilities). In the event such construction is necessary, the provider shall
first give the City 10 days written notice of its intent to so construct.

owner shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

license agreement with the owner of an electrical system, the franchisee
shall notify the City Manager in writing within 14 days.

sends to the Michigan Public Service Commission and copies of all
orders, decisions or correspondence franchisee receives from the
Michigan Public Service Commission.
A. A provider shall have no recourse against the City for any loss or damage
arising out of the failure of the City to have the authority to grant all or
any part of a revocable franchise or the authority to grant permission to
use all or part of the rights-of-way. A provider acknowledges that on
accepting a revocable franchise:
(1) It did so relying on its own investigation and understanding of the
power and authority of the City; and
(2) That it has not been induced to obtain a revocable franchise by any
understanding or promise by or on behalf of the City concerning any
term or condition of a revocable franchise not expressed in this
chapter or in the revocable franchise.
B. Each provider accepts as its own risk that the City may make use of the
rights-of-way in which a system used by a provider is located in a
manner inconsistent with the provider's use and that in such event the
provider will not be entitled to compensation from the City.
C. The City shall not be liable for injury or damage to others arising out of a
provider's use of a system due to the act or omission of any person or
entity other than the City or those persons or entities for which the City
is legally liable as a matter of law.
D. A provider shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold
harmless the City and its respective employees, officers, boards, agents,
and contractors (hereinafter referred to in this chapter as
"indemnitees"), from and against any and all liability which may be
imposed upon or against the indemnitees by reason of any act or
omission of a provider, its employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors, resulting in personal injury or property damage to any
person arising out of its use of an electrical system.
E. In the event any action shall be brought against the indemnitees by
reason of any matter for which the indemnitees are indemnified
hereunder, a provider shall, at the provider's sole cost and expense,
defend same with legal counsel selected by the provider and consented
to by the City Attorney, which consent shall not to be unreasonably
withheld.
F. A provider shall immediately advise the City Attorney of any claim or
litigation that may result in liability to the City.
G. The issuance of a revocable franchise, or other action or transaction of
the City, shall not constitute any representation, guarantee or warranty
§ 33-124 KALAMAZOO CODE § 33-125
32:VII-4
§ 33-126. Violation; penalty. [Amended 5-7-2018 by Ord. No. 1964]
by the City of any kind to any person, customer or a provider and shall
not be a defense against a provider's obligation to indemnify and hold
the City harmless.

of this chapter with a civil infraction, unless the section specifically
states otherwise.
(1) A fine for a violation of this chapter shall be not more than $200.

individual who has been previously adjudicated responsible for a
violation of this chapter within any twelve-month period may be
fined a minimum fine of $200 but not more than $500.

(1) Bring an action for an injunction or other process against a person to
restrain, prevent, or abate any violation of this chapter; and/or
(2) Revoke a person's revocable franchise.
C. Each day on which any violation of this chapter continues constitutes a
separate infraction and shall be subject to penalties and other remedies
as a separate infraction.
D. Any material, false or misleading statement or representation knowingly
made by an applicant or provider in an application, in any document
submitted to the City pursuant to this chapter, shall be a violation of this
chapter and, if made by a provider, a material breach of its revocable
franchise, and shall subject the applicant or provider to all penalties and
remedies which are available to the City, including the denial of the
application or revocation of the revocable franchise.

A. Preamble. It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the
State of Michigan and its political subdivisions to provide housing for
low-income persons and families and to encourage the development of
such housing by providing for a service charge payment in lieu of
property taxes in accordance with the State Housing Development
Authority Act. The City is authorized by this Act to establish or change
the service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all classes of
housing exempt from taxation under the Act at any amount as agreed
upon by the City and the sponsor, as allowed by the Act, not to exceed
the taxes that would be paid but for the Act. It is further acknowledged
§ 35-1 SWIMMING POOLS § 35-4
34:I-1
that housing for low-income persons and families is a public necessity,
and as the City will be benefited and improved by such housing, the
encouragement of the same by providing a real estate tax exemption
for such housing is a valid public purpose. It is further acknowledged
that the continuance of the provisions of this section for tax exemption
and the service charge payment in lieu of ad valorem property taxes
during the periods contemplated by this section are essential to the
determination of economic feasibility of housing developments that are
constructed or rehabilitated with financing extended in reliance on such
tax exemption.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
ACT — The State Housing Development Authority Act, being Public Act
346 of 1966 of the State of Michigan, as amended, MCLA § 125.1401 et
seq.
ANNUAL SHELTER RENTS — The total collections during a calendar year
or other agreed-upon annual period from or paid on behalf of all
occupants of the housing development representing rent or occupancy
charges, exclusive of charges for utilities furnished to the occupants.

receives project-based Section 8 rental subsidy.)
AUTHORITY — The Michigan State Housing Development Authority.
CONTRACT RENTS — The total contract rents (as defined by HUD in
regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 8 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937, as amended) received in connection with the
operation of a housing development during a calendar year or other
agreed-upon annual period, exclusive of utilities. (This definition is not
applicable to a housing development project that does not receive
project-based Section 8 rental subsidy.)
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT — A development or project which
meets the qualifications of and is eligible for a service charge payment
in lieu of taxes under the Act and this section.
HUD — The Department of Housing and Urban Development of the
United States government.

pursuant to applicable HUD or Authority regulations, rules, or adopted
program guidelines as being eligible to move into a housing

11 of the Act), or a loan or grant made or to be made by the Authority,
for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition and/or permanent
financing of a housing development project, that qualifies for a payment
in lieu of taxes pursuant to the Act and this section and is secured by a
mortgage on the housing project.

34:I-2
SPONSOR — Any persons or entities that receive or assume a mortgage
loan.
UTILITIES — Charges for gas, electric, water, sanitary sewer and other

sponsor.
C. Class of eligible housing development projects. It is determined that the
class of housing development projects to which the tax exemption shall
apply and for which a service charge shall be paid in lieu of such taxes
shall be those housing development projects that are for persons and
families of low income and which are financed with a mortgage loan.
Prior to being eligible for tax exemption under this section, each housing
development project shall be presented to the City Commission, which
shall make a determination by resolution as to whether the proposed
project qualifies for exemption and, if so, shall set forth the service
charge payment in lieu of taxes to be made for that project. The service
charge payment in lieu of taxes for the project set by the City
Commission shall be reflective of the mix of dwelling units intended to be
occupied by low-income individuals and families and dwelling units
intended to be occupied by other than low-income individuals and
families. Projects in which at least 80% of the dwelling units are for
persons and families of low income are eligible for a tax exemption and
the payment of a service charge in lieu of ad valorem taxes on all
dwelling units. Projects in which less than 80% of units are reserved for
low-income persons and families are eligible to pay a service charge on
the income-restricted units only; for the remaining units, the developer
may choose to pay a service charge equivalent to ad valorem taxes on
those noneligible units or create a condominium to separate the noneligible
units from the eligible income-restricted tax-exempt units.
Documentary evidence must be presented to the City Commission to
establish that the project so qualifies for exemption, whether by making
available to tenants a program of rent supplements or housing
assistance payments, as established and allocated under the rules and
regulations of either HUD or the Authority, or both, or the project is being
operated in accordance with the requirements of the Housing
Development Grant Program, or otherwise qualifies by law.
D. Establishment of annual service charges. The housing development
projects and the property on which they are or will be located that are
within the class of housing development projects for tax exemption
pursuant to this section shall be eligible for exemption from all ad
valorem property taxes. The City acknowledges that the sponsor, and
the Authority, in the case of a sponsor receiving an Authority-financed
mortgage loan, or the sponsor and the mortgage lender, in the case of a
sponsor receiving a federally aided mortgage loan, have conditioned the
economic feasibility of the housing development project in reliance upon
the enactment and continuing effect of this section, as from time to time
amended, and the qualification of the housing development project for
exemption from all ad valorem property taxes and a service charge
§ 35-4 SWIMMING POOLS § 35-4
34:I-3
payment in lieu of taxes as established in this section. Therefore, the
City, in consideration of the sponsor's offer, subject to receipt of a
mortgage loan to construct or rehabilitate, own and operate said
housing development project, agrees to accept payment of an annual
service charge for public services in lieu of all ad valorem property taxes.
The annual service charge payment shall be in an amount equal to a
City Commission determined percentage of the annual shelter rents and
contract rents actually collected by the housing development project
sponsor during each calendar year or other agreed-upon annual period
as determined by the City Commission in a resolution to be adopted
pursuant to this section for each project.
E. Limitation on the payment of annual service charge. Except as otherwise
provided in this section, the service charge to be paid each year in lieu of
taxes for the part of an otherwise tax-exempt housing development
which is occupied as commercial (nonresidential) space or by other than
low-income persons or families shall be equal to the full amount of the
taxes which would be paid on that portion of the housing development if
the project were not tax-exempt.
F. Manner of payment in lieu of taxes. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, the annual service charge payment in lieu of taxes shall be
based on the annual shelter rents or contract rents for the preceding
calendar year or other agreed-upon annual period based on the audited
financial report for that year as provided by the sponsor to the City. The
annual service charge payment in lieu of taxes shall be paid to the City
on or before 120 days after the close of the owner's fiscal year. Any
annual service charge payment in lieu of taxes or any portion of the
annual service charge payment remaining unpaid after 120 days after
the close of the owner's fiscal year shall have interest of 1% per month,
together with a penalty fee of 4%, added to it, provided that the total
penalty fee shall not exceed 4% of the total service charge payment in
lieu of taxes due and payable. The annual service charge payment in lieu
of taxes shall be accompanied by an estimate of the shelter rents or
contract rents for the current calendar year and a certified annual audit
of the gross rentals and utility costs of the project for the preceding
calendar year along with documentation regarding how the sponsor has
calculated the amount of the annual service charge payment it is
submitting to the City. The sponsor shall also provide the City with any
other audited financial statements or other documentation as may be
necessary to establish compliance with this section.
G. Contractual effect of section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
15(a)(5) of the Act to the contrary, a contract shall be deemed effected
between the City of Kalamazoo and the sponsor, with the Authority as
third-party beneficiary, to provide a tax exemption and accept service
charge payments in lieu of taxes as previously described by this section
upon the adoption of a project-specific resolution as provided by this
section.
§ 35-4 KALAMAZOO CODE § 35-4
34:I-4
H. Duration. Unless indicated otherwise in the resolution adopted by the
City Commission, the property tax exemption provided under this
section shall commence at the beginning of the tax year immediately
after the property has satisfied all the requirements under the Act. If, at
the inception of the exemption provided by this section, the property
does not generate any annual shelter rents during one or more calendar
years or other agreed-upon annual period, the service charge payment
shall equal the amount of regular ad valorem taxes that would have
been paid for the property until the property begins to generate annual
shelter rents or contract rents. Unless indicated otherwise in the
resolution adopted by the City Commission, the duration of the property
tax exemption provided under this section shall continue so long as the
Authority-aided or federally aided mortgage loan remains outstanding
and unpaid, provided that construction or rehabilitation of the housing
development commences within one year from the effective date of the
resolution. In the event that the housing development project sponsor
fails to timely pay the annual service charge in lieu of taxes, the City
Commission, by resolution, may, in addition to any other means
available under law, elect to: 1) employ collection procedures that are in
accordance with the provisions of the General Property Tax Act (1893
Public Act 206, as amended, MCLA § 211.1 et seq.); or 2) direct the City
Attorney to commence an action in a Kalamazoo County court of
competent jurisdiction to collect any outstanding past-due service
charge payments and/or seek an order terminating the contract and
revoking the tax-exempt status of the project due to the breach of the
acknowledged contract between the City and sponsor created pursuant
to the provisions of this section. If the tax-exempt status of the housing
project is revoked, the housing development project shall then be placed
on the tax rolls on the next December 31 following the revocation of the
tax-exempt status of the project. If a housing development project is
added to the tax rolls and any service charge payment remains unpaid
at the time the housing development project is added to the tax rolls, the
City officials in charge of the collection thereof shall certify to the tax
assessing officer of the City the fact of such delinquency, whereupon
such charge, together with any accumulated interest and penalty fees,
shall be entered upon the tax rolls as a charge against such premises
and shall be collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner
as general City taxes against such premises.
I. Severability. Should any section, clause or provision of this section be
declared by any court to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity
of this section as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so
declared to be invalid.
J. Inconsistent ordinances. All ordinances or parts of ordinances
inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this section are repealed
to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict.
K. Savings clause. The adoption of amendments to this section shall not
repeal or revoke the tax-exempt status and payment in lieu of taxes
§ 35-4 SWIMMING POOLS § 35-4
34:I-5
§ 35-5. Penalty and collection fees for delinquent taxes. [Added
12-26-1979 by Ord. No. 1182; amended 4-7-1980 by Ord. No. 1194]
Pursuant to § 87 of the City Charter, all taxes due and remaining unpaid after
the last of the month in which such installment shall be payable shall have a
penalty of 1% per month, together with a collection fee of 4% added to them;
provided that the total collection fee shall not exceed 4% of the total tax due
and payable on the first day of July next preceding.133
previously established for any other housing development by the City
Commission.
133. Editor's Note: Former Art. II, Kalamazoo Downtown Development Authority Tax Increment
Financing Plan and Development Plan, adopted 12-5-1988 by Ord. No. 1450, as amended,
which immediately followed, was repealed 5-20-2019 by Ord. No. 1987. Ordinance No.
1987 also stated that Ord. No. 1679, which amended Ord. No. 1450, was repealed except
to the extent that the legal description and boundaries of the Downtown Development
Area (identified as Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively, in the Restated Plan that was attached
as Exhibit A to Ord. No. 1679) remain full force and effect.

direction which is within the intersection or so close thereto as to constitute
an immediate hazard, but such driver, having so yielded and having given a
signal when and as required by this article, may make such left turn and the
drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle making the left turn;

judge, district court referee, or district court magistrate may order a
person who violates this section to perform not to exceed 100 hours of

wages, including overtime pay, of public safety or other City personnel
for time spent responding to the incident, including arresting the
individual, processing the individual after an arrest, preparing reports on
the incident and investigating the incident; also, incarceration costs,
medical costs of the inmate, collecting and analyzing evidence, including

responsible and/or liable for all expenses of the City as a result of the
emergency response.
D. For the purposes of this section, a person is under the influence of an
alcoholic beverage or controlled substance or the combined influence of
an alcoholic beverage or controlled substance when his or her physical
or mental abilities are substantially and materially affected by the
consumption of an alcoholic beverage or a controlled substance or the
combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and a controlled substance,
or when his or her ability to drive was so weakened or reduced by the
consumption of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or a
combination thereof that said individual drove with less ability than
would an ordinary, careful and prudent driver, said reduction being
visible to an ordinary observant person; or, alternatively, that he or she
no longer has the ability to operate a motor vehicle with the caution
characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence. Further, it shall be
presumed that a person was operating a motor vehicle while under the
influence of an alcoholic beverage if a chemical analysis of his or her

person liable for expenses under this section. The charge constitutes a
debt of that person and is collectible by the City in the same manner as
in the case of an obligation under a contract, express or implied; except
that liability for the expenses provided for in this section shall not be
insurable, and no insurance policy shall provide or pay for any of the
expenses. This section shall be construed to be a responsibility and
liability of a civil nature on the part of the driver and shall not be
construed to conflict, contravene or enlarge or reduce any criminal
liability or responsibility, including fines imposed by a judge under the
Michigan Vehicle Code on a driver for operating a motor vehicle while
under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and/or controlled substance
or while impaired thereby.
F. The City Commission may, by resolution, adopt a schedule of the costs
included within the expenses of an emergency response.

this section. Said bill shall require full payment within 30 days from the
date of service.

(2) Enclosed in a case that is not readily accessible from the interior of
the vehicle, if the vehicle in which the person is traveling does not
have a trunk.

§ 36-143. General authority to test, erect, maintain and remove.
[Traf. Code § 83q]
The Traffic Engineer shall test, place and maintain, or remove, traffic-control
signs, signals, lane markings and other devices and shall determine the
hours and days during which any traffic-control device shall be in operation
or be in effect, when and as required under this chapter, to indicate and to
carry out the provisions of this chapter, and may test, place and maintain
such additional traffic-control devices as he may deem necessary to regulate
traffic under this chapter and under state law and to warn or guide traffic.
§ 36-144. Permission required for erection on state trunk-line
highways. [Traf. Code § 83r]
Notwithstanding the authority granted to the Traffic Engineer under this
chapter, no stop signs, pavement markings, buttons or other traffic-control
devices shall be erected or maintained upon any state trunk-line highway
under the jurisdiction of the state highway commissioner, without the latter's
written permission.
§ 36-145. Conformity with state manual and specifications. [Traf.
Code § 83q]
In all respects, all traffic-control signs, signals and other devices shall
conform to the state manual and specifications adopted pursuant to MSA
§ 9.2308 (MCLA § 257.608).
§ 36-146. Obedience; avoidance. [Traf. Code §§ 42, 43]
It shall be unlawful for the operator of any vehicle to fail or refuse to obey
any traffic-control device placed in accord with the provisions of this chapter
or the Michigan Vehicle Code unless otherwise directed by a police officer. No
such operator shall attempt to avoid obedience to any traffic-control device
by driving upon or through any private property.
§ 36-147. Marking of traffic lanes. [Traf. Code § 83e]
The Traffic Engineer is hereby authorized to mark lanes upon the roadway of
any street where he shall find that a regular alignment of traffic is necessary
in the interests of safety and efficiency, or at such places as he may find to
be advisable, consistent with this chapter and state law.
§ 36-148. Location of signals; signal legend generally. [Traf. Code
§ 1; amended 4-19-1976 by Ord. No. 1083]
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals, at least one signal
shall be located over the traveled portion of the roadway so as to give drivers
a clear indication of the right-of-way assignment from their normal positions
§ 36-143 SWIMMING POOLS § 36-148
34:IV-1
approaching the intersection. The vehicle signals shall exhibit different
colored lights successively, one at a time or with arrows. The following colors
shall be used and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
as follows:
A. Green indication. Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight
through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits either
such turn; but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
B. Steady yellow indication. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection, or at a limit
line when marked, but if such stop cannot be made in safety, a vehicle
may be driven cautiously through the intersection.
C. Steady red indication. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone
shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection, or at a limit line when marked, or if none, then before
entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until a green
indication is shown; provided that after so stopping, vehicular traffic
shall be privileged to make a right turn from a one-way or two-way street
into a two-way street or into a one-way street carrying traffic in the
direction of the right turn; or a left turn from a one-way or two-way street
into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn,
unless prohibited by sign, signal, marking, light or other traffic-control
device. Vehicular traffic so turning shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
D. Arrow indications:
(1) Green arrow (steady). Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal,
shown alone or in combination with another indication, may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement
indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by
other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(2) Red arrow (flashing). When a red arrow is illuminated by rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering
the nearest crosswalk at an intersection, or at a limit line when
marked, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall
then be privileged to make the movement indicated, if no
interference is offered pedestrians or vehicles lawfully on the street.

No person shall, without lawful authority, attempt to or in fact alter, deface,
injure, knock down or remove any traffic-control device.
§ 36-151. Unauthorized devices. [Traf. Code § 84]
In the event a traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at
a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section
shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which, by their
nature, can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at
a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall
be made; but in the absence of any sign or marking, the stop shall
be made at the signal.
A. Whenever flashing red or yellow signals are used they shall require
obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
(1) Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated by rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering
the nearest crosswalk at an intersection, or at a limit line when
marked, or if none, then before entering the intersection, and the
right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
(2) Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed
through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.
A. Except with authority of a statute or ordinance or of a duly authorized
public body or official, no person shall place, maintain or display, along
any highway or upon any structure in or over any highway, any sign,
signal, marking, device, blinking, oscillating or rotating light or lights,
decoration or banner which is or purports to be or is in imitation of or
resembles or which can be mistaken for a traffic-control device or
railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of
traffic, or which hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of
any traffic-control device or any railroad sign or signal, and no person
shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority permit upon any
highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial
advertising.
B. No person shall place, maintain or display along any highway any
blinking, oscillating or rotating light or lights sufficiently similar in color
and design that they may be mistaken for the distinguishing lights
authorized by law for emergency vehicles or that create a hazard for the
safety of drivers using the highways.

§ 38-9. Cross connections. [P.S. Code § PS403.110]
A. The City Manager is hereby authorized, with the consent of the City
Commission, to determine and establish a schedule of construction
charges for the various sizes and types of water service connections for
each calendar year. Each schedule shall become effective when
approved by motion duly adopted by the City Commission. Such
schedule of charges shall be based on the following, as applicable:
(1) Recovery of all costs normally incurred for this type of construction.
(2) The size and length of pipe to be used for standard size connections,
up through 1 1/4 inch. When the main is in a public street, the length
of pipe shall be computed from the center of the right-of-way.
(3) Extra costs of construction during winter months.
(4) Repair or replacement of pavement and sidewalk.
(5) Exceptional surface repairs, including landscaping.
For larger sized pipes and for all extensions or alterations to
existing services, charges shall be based upon actual costs.
B. The Director of the Department of Public Utilities may establish advance
deposits for construction charges for water service connections for each
calendar year.
C. Advance deposits toward construction charges established under this
section shall be made before construction. Any balance owed shall be
due within 30 days after billing. Interest at the rate established by the
City Commission for past due accounts shall be charged upon any
delinquent unpaid balance. If such unpaid balance, with interest, is not
paid within six months, the fact shall be reported to the City Commission
for establishment of a lien against the real estate.
A. No connection shall be installed which will connect the City water supply
to any system of pipes or piping which may also be supplied from any
other source. The use of check valves or valves of any kind to separate
the City supply from any other supply will not be permitted. There must
be an absolute physical separation of the City water supply and any
other supply.
B. Connections installed contrary to this section prior to the effective date
of Ordinance No. 62, from which this section is derived, may continue
until the health officer or the Director of Utilities orders such connection
discontinued. Customers shall ordinarily be given five days in which to
comply with such an order, but in cases of emergency, when it is
deemed by the health officer that public health is being jeopardized by
such a connection, customers shall be required to comply with the order
immediately. If such a customer shall fail to comply with such an order
within the time limits herein specified, such failure shall be considered as

provided in Subsection C below. In addition to the other remedies
provided in this section, the City shall have the right to shut off and
discontinue the supply of water service to any premises for the

3% of the total time that the Kalamazoo cable office is normally open for
business.
§ 41-14. Telephone response time.
A. Monday through Friday (holidays excepted) from 8:30 a.m. through 6:00
p.m.; and

A. Monday through Friday (holidays excepted) from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.;
and
B. Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon (holidays excepted).
A. Generally.
(1) Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a
customer service representative, including wait time, and the time
required to transfer the call, shall not exceed one minute from the
effective date of this chapter through March 1, 1991, and 45
seconds after March 1, 1991.

the City of Kalamazoo for the purpose of providing cable services. In
exercising rights pursuant hereto, grantee shall not endanger or
interfere with the lives of persons, interfere with any installations of the
City, any public utility serving the City or any other person permitted to
use the streets nor unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the
streets. The grant of one agreement does not establish priority for use
over the other present or future permit or agreement holders or the
City's own use of the streets. The City shall at all times control the
distribution of space in, over, under or across all streets occupied by the
cable services. All rights granted for the construction and operation of
the cable services shall be subject to the continuing right of the City to
require such reconstruction, relocation, change or discontinuance, of the
appliances used by the cable services in the streets of the City, as shall
in the opinion of the City be necessary in the public interest.
§ 44-2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-3
44:18
§ 44-4. Agreement required.
No cable system shall be allowed to occupy or use the public rights-of-way of
the City or be allowed to operate within the City without an agreement.
§ 44-5. Use of public streets.
For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable system in the City,
the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and
retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the streets of the City
its system facilities and other property and equipment as are necessary to
the operation of the cable system, provided that grantee complies with all
design, construction, safety, and performance provisions contained in this
chapter, the agreement, and other generally applicable local ordinances.
The grantee shall also obtain all required pole attachment agreements for
use of any utility poles or other utility facilities required in connection with
the provision of services. No reference herein, or in any agreement, to the
"streets" shall be deemed to be a guaranty by the City that its title to any
property is sufficient to permit its use for such purpose, and the grantee
shall, by its use of such terms, be deemed to gain only such rights to use
property in the City as the City may have the undisputed right and power to
give.
§ 44-6. Term of agreement.
The term of the agreement shall commence upon execution of the
agreement by the City and the grantee and shall continue for a period
specified in the agreement, unless sooner terminated as provided herein. As

operation of a cable system within the City or the right of the City to permit
the use of the streets or public grounds of the City for any purpose whatever.

agreement granted hereto shall be binding upon the grantee, its
successors, lessees or assignees.

§ 44-3 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-7

taken as a whole, shall be neither more favorable nor less burdensome than
agreements previously granted. No privilege or power of eminent domain is
bestowed on grantee by the grant of an agreement.
§ 44-8. Right of condemnation reserved.
Nothing in this chapter or an agreement shall limit any right the City may
have to lawfully acquire by eminent domain or otherwise any property of
grantee.
§ 44-9. City's right to perform public works.
Nothing in this chapter or an agreement shall prevent the City or any
governmental authority from performing or carrying on, directly or indirectly,
any public works or public improvements. Should the cable system in any
way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of such public
works or public improvements, the grantee shall, at its own cost and
expense, protect or relocate its cable system, or part thereof, as reasonably
directed by the City or any governmental authority (so long as other
similarly-situated users of rights-of-way are treated in a similar fashion).
§ 44-10. Emergency removal of plant.
If, in case of fire or other disaster, it becomes necessary in the reasonable
judgment of the City to cut or move any portion of the cable facilities, the
City shall have the right to do so at the sole cost and expense of grantee.
The City shall first endeavor to provide notice to grantee and request that
grantee, conduct the necessary work, if possible. The grantee shall bear all
costs of reinstallation, repair, and other costs resulting from or arising out of
the emergency cutting or removal of the cable system.
§ 44-11. Removal or abandonment.
Upon termination of the agreement by passage of time or otherwise, and
unless grantee transfers the cable system to a subsequent grantee approved
by the City, grantee shall remove its supporting structures, poles,
transmission and distribution systems, and all other appurtenances from
the public rights-of-way and shall restore any property, public or private,
to its original condition prior to the installation, erection, or construction
of the cable system. Restoration of City property shall be in accordance
with the directions and specifications of the City and all applicable law. Said
removal and restoration shall be at the grantee's expense. If such removal
and restoration is not completed within 12 months after the notice by the
City, delivered in writing to grantee, all of the grantee's property remaining
in the affected public rights-of-way shall, at the option of the City, be deemed
abandoned and shall, at the option of the City, become the property of
the City. In the event the grantee fails or refuses to remove its system or
satisfactorily restore all areas, the City may perform such work and collect
the cost thereof from the grantee. No surety on any bond shall be discharged
until the City has certified to the grantee in writing that the system has been
§ 44-7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-11

dismantled, removed, and all other property restored to the satisfaction of
the City. This section (requiring removal or abandonment) shall not apply if
grantee is lawfully no longer a cable system operator and if: (i) the plant
is in continuous use; (ii) removal and abandonment is addressed by other
laws, regulation or otherwise, and (iii) the grantee has received all lawfully
required local, state or federal authority to so operate.
§ 44-12. Transfer of ownership or control.
A. Transfer of agreement. An agreement, in whole or in part, shall not be
assigned, transferred, leased, sold, or disposed of in any manner, nor
shall title to the cable system, legal or equitable, pass to or vest in any
other person without the prior written consent of the City.
B. Transfer of ownership. The grantee shall not sell, transfer, or dispose of
25% or more, at any one time, of the ownership or control of grantee, or
40% or more cumulatively over the term of the agreement of such
interest to another person, or group of persons acting in concert, without
first obtaining the written consent of the City. Grantee need not,
however, obtain said consent from the City when the sale, transfer or
disposition is to a person which is then under common control with the
grantee, provided that prior to such sale, disposition or transfer the
grantee provides to the City verifiable information establishing that such
other person has the financial, legal, and technical ability to fully
perform all obligations of the agreement.
C. Transfer of control. No change, directly or indirectly, in the control of the
grantee or of any person holding a controlling interest in grantee shall
take place without the prior written consent of the City.
D. City approval. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to
such transfer the City may inquire into the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, as well
as its ability to comply with the agreement and applicable City
ordinances. The grantee shall provide the City with all reasonably
required information, provided the City serves grantee with written
notice of the required information within 60 days of receiving grantee's
request for transfer on notice of change in control (unless a shorter time
is established by federal law, in which case said shorter time shall
apply). The City reserves the right to impose reasonable conditions on
the transferee as a condition of the transfer to ensure that the transferee
is able to meet existing ordinances. Every transfer of ownership or
control shall make the agreement subject to cancellation unless and
until the City issues its written consent.
E. No waiver of City property rights. The consent of the City to a transfer of
the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the
City in and any property owned by the City or to public rights-of-way, and
any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms
and conditions of this chapter and the agreement.
§ 44-11 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-12
44:21
§ 44-13. Assumption of ownership or control.
Any financial institution having a pledge of an agreement granted pursuant
to this chapter or of the assets of a cable system for the advancement of
money for the construction and/or operation of the cable system may notify
the City that it will take control and operate the cable television system. If
the financial institution takes possession of the cable system the City shall
take no action to effect a termination of this agreement without first giving to
said institution written notice thereof and a period of six months thereafter
(unless otherwise provided herein below) to allow the financial institution or
its agent(s) to continue operating as the grantee under this agreement and
to request the City, and for the City to determine whether, to consent to the
assignment of the grantee's rights, title, interest and obligations under this
agreement to a qualified operator. The financial institution shall be entitled
to such possession and other rights granted under this paragraph until such
time that the City determines whether to consent to such assignment (the
"extended time"). If the City finds that such transfer, after considering the
factors set forth in the section above regarding transfer of ownership or
control, is acceptable to the City, the City will consent to the transfer and
assign the rights and obligations of such agreement. During the six month
period or extended time, the financial institution shall enjoy all the rights,
benefits and privileges of the grantee under this agreement, and the City
shall not disturb such possession by the financial institution, provided the
financial institution complies in all respects with the terms and provisions
of this agreement and the ordinance. The various rights granted to the
financial institution under this subsection are contingent upon the lender's
continuous compliance with the terms and provisions of this agreement
and the ordinance during the entire aforementioned six month period or
extended time, if applicable.
F. Signatory requirement. Any approval by the City of transfer of ownership
or control shall be contingent upon the prospective party becoming a
signatory to the agreement.
G. Notification of sale. In the event the grantee places its system for public
sale, grantee, or its designee, shall notify the City, at the same time it
notifies other prospective purchasers, of that fact. The grantee shall also
advise the City of the proposed terms and conditions of such a sale, to
the extent they have been made public, so long as the City can commit
to grantee that such information shall be kept as confidential as grantee
requires other prospective purchasers.
H. Time frame for City review. The City shall act upon any transfer request
within a reasonable time, but in no event more than allowed by federal
law.
I. Grantee for the purpose of Subsection C immediately above (regarding
transfers of control), "grantee" shall be deemed to include not only the
named grantee but also its subsidiaries, parents or affiliated companies,
associations or organizations as well as all persons having any title or
interest in the system.
§ 44-12 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-14
44:22
§ 44-14. Right to purchase.
In the event the grantee (a) forfeits or surrenders, or the City terminates
the agreement for cause, pursuant to provisions of this chapter and the
agreement, or (b) the agreement is lawfully not renewed at the normal
expiration of the agreement term, the City shall have the right, directly or
as an intermediary, to purchase the cable system or effect the ownership of
the system to another person. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be in full
accordance with the Federal Cable Act.
§ 44-15. Agreement renewal.
An agreement, once granted, shall be subject to renewal or nonrenewal in
accordance with applicable federal law.
§ 44-16. Agreement fees.
A. Fee. The grantee of any agreement hereunder shall pay to the City an
agreement fee in an amount as designated in the agreement, which sum
shall be 5% of the gross annual receipts, or in a greater amount if
allowed by federal law and approved by the City Commission. The
obligation to pay such fees shall commence as of the effective date of
the agreement. Once every 12 months, the City shall be furnished by the
grantee a statement of said payments certified by an officer of grantee,
reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and the above
charges and computations for the period covered by the payment.
B. Agreement fee in addition to other tax or payments. Payment of the
agreement fee made by grantee to the City shall not be considered in
the nature of a tax, but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are
now or may be required hereafter to be paid by any federal, state, or
local law.
C. Acceptance by the City. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall
be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the City may have for further or additional sums payable as an
agreement fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other
obligation of the grantee.
D. Failure to make required payment. In the event that any agreement
payment or recomputed amount is not paid on or before the date it is
due, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, equal to the commercial prime interest
rate of the City's primary depository bank during the period that such
unpaid amount is owed.
E. Payments to be made quarterly. The agreement fee and any other cost
or damages assessed shall be payable quarterly to the City. The grantee
shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue
within the City during the period for which said quarterly payment is
made, and said payment shall be made to the City not later than 45 days
§ 44-14 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-16
44:23
§ 44-17. Forfeiture or revocation.
after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation
dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September and
December.
F. The City's right to inspection. The City shall have the right to inspect the
grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any
amounts determined to be payable under this chapter. Audits shall be at
the expense of the grantee if such audit determines that the grantee has
underpaid the agreement fees by 5% or more. Any additional amount
due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days
following written notice to the grantee by the City which notice shall
include a copy of the audit report.
A. Grounds for revocation. Subject to the limitations and procedures set
forth below, the City reserves the right to revoke any agreement granted
hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the
agreement in each of the following circumstances, each of which shall
represent a default and breach under the ordinance and the agreement:
(1) The grantee shall be in default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this chapter, the agreement, or under
such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered
into by and between the City and the grantee.
(2) The grantee violates any orders or rulings of any regulatory body
having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this chapter or the
agreement, unless grantee has initiated a timely challenge to such
order or ruling with an appropriate tribunal.
(3) The grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of this chapter
or the agreement or practices any fraud or deceit upon the City or
cable subscribers.
(4) The grantee's initial or rebuild construction schedule is delayed later
than the schedule contained in the agreement or beyond any
extended date set by the City.
(5) The grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt.
(6) The grantee fails to restore service to substantially all of the system
after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when
approval of such interruption is obtained from the City.
(7) The grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application for or
negotiation of the agreement or any extension or renewal thereof.
(8) The grantee ceases to provide cable services over the cable system
for any reason within the control of the grantee.
B. Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The grantee shall not
be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of
§ 44-16 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-17
44:24
this chapter in any case, in which performance of any such provision is
prevented by reasons beyond the grantee's control (e.g. riots, floods,
acts of nature, strikes) so long as the grantee performs as soon
thereafter as reasonably possible.
C. Effect of pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any
regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall not
excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations under this
chapter or the agreement unless there is a court or regulatory body
order to the contrary.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The City shall make written demand upon the grantee that it cure its
failure, refusal or neglect. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the
grantee continues for a period of 30 days after said demand, or
longer in cases where the City reasonably determines that
compliance or correction requires a longer cure period, the City may
place a request for termination of the agreement upon a City
Commission meeting agenda. The City shall cause to be served
upon such grantee at least seven days prior to the date of such
Commission meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such
termination. Notice of the City's intent and the time and place of the
meeting shall be published by the City at least once, seven days
before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City.
(2) At said meeting, the Commission shall receive testimony or other
evidence from any interested person, including the grantee, and
shall thereafter determine, in its discretion, whether any failure,
refusal or neglect by the grantee has occurred which warrants
revocation of the agreement.
(3) If the Commission determines such a failure, refusal or neglect has
occurred but that it was with just cause, as defined by the City, the
Commission may direct the grantee to comply within such time and
manner and upon such terms and conditions as the Commission
deems reasonable.
(4) If the Commission determines such failure, refusal, or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, the Commission may, by resolution,
declare that the agreement of the grantee shall be terminated and
bond forfeited unless there be compliance by the grantee within a
specified number of days, not to exceed 60.
E. Disposition of facilities. In the event an agreement is revoked or
otherwise terminated, the City may purchase the system under the
procedures set forth above or order the removal of the system facilities,
which removal shall be consistent with the removal requirements set
forth herein.
§ 44-17 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-18
44:25
§ 44-18. Regulatory authority.
A. On-going regulation. The City shall exercise appropriate regulatory
authority under the provisions of this chapter and applicable law. The
City Manager or his designee shall provide day-to-day administration
and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and any agreement
granted hereunder.
B. Change in law or regulation. In the event that any actions of the state or
federal government or any agency thereof, or any court of competent
jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially reduces the power or
authority of the City under this chapter or the agreement, or if in
compliance with any local, state, or federal law or regulation, the
grantee finds conflict with the terms of this chapter the agreement, or
any law or regulation of the City, then as soon as possible following
knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the City of the reduction or
the point of conflict. The City may then notify the grantee that it wishes
to negotiate those provisions which are affected in any way by such
reduction or conflict. Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in good faith
with the City in the development of alternate provisions which shall fairly
restore the City to the maximum level of authority and power permitted
by this chapter or the agreement. The City shall have the right to modify
any of the provisions to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to
carry out the full intent and purpose of this chapter and the agreement
subject to applicable state and federal law.
C. Authority. The City reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary
authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible under state or
federal law, to regulate the cable system, the agreement and the
grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities
at any time permit regulation not presently permitted to the City, the
City may, without the approval of the grantee, engage in any such
additional regulation as may then be permissible, whether or not
contemplated by this chapter or the agreement.
D. Right of inspection of records. Subject to appropriate protection of
confidential material, the City shall have the right to inspect all books,
records, reports, maps, plans, financial statements, and other like
materials of the grantee which relate to the operation of this chapter, the
agreement and applicable law and regulation at any time during normal
business hours.
E. Right of inspection of cable facilities and property. At all reasonable
times, and after reasonable notice, the City shall have the right to
inspect all cable facilities, and property situated within the City (and, as
it relates to headends or distribution lines, without the City) and
installation work performed in the public rights-of-way.
F. Right to test. Unless prohibited by law or modified by the agreement,
and after providing grantee with reasonable notice, the City may make
such tests of grantee's cable system as are reasonably necessary to
§ 44-18 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-18
44:26
§ 44-19. Bonds, insurance and indemnification.
ensure compliance with this chapter and the agreement. Such tests
shall be performed in such a fashion as to minimize disruption within
grantee's cable system.
G. Expense reimbursement to City. The grantee shall reimburse the City for
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City in connection
with the initial granting (but not renewing or transferring) of an
agreement, including, but not limited to, consultant fees, attorneys' fees,
publication fees, travel expenses and all other direct costs. Such
payment shall be made within 30 days after the City furnishes the
grantee with a written, detailed statement of such expenses.
A. Performance bond. At the City's election and as specified in the
agreement, the grantee shall obtain and maintain during the entire term
of any agreement and any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost
and expense, and file with the City, a construction bond and a
performance bond in amounts specified in the agreement to guarantee
the faithful performance of the grantee of its obligations. Such bonds
must be issued by a surety licensed to do business in the State of
Michigan and be of a form and contain terms and conditions as required
by the agreement.
B. Letter of credit. At the City's election and as specified in the agreement,
the grantee shall, in addition to or in place of said bonds, obtain,
maintain, and file with the City an irrevocable letter of credit from a
financial institution acceptable to the City and licensed to do business in
the State in an amount specified in the agreement, naming the City as
beneficiary. The conditions upon which the City may draw upon the letter
of credit shall be established in the agreement.
C. Security fund. At the City's election and as specified in the agreement,
the grantee shall, in addition to or in place of said bonds and letters of
credit, deposit with the City, within 30 days after execution of the
agreement, the sum specified in the agreement, as further security for
the faithful performance by grantee of the provisions of the agreement
and compliance with all orders, permits, and directions of any agency of
the City and the payment of all claims, liens, fees, liquidated damages or
taxes to the City arising by reason of the construction, operation,
maintenance, or repair of grantee's cable system. The conditions upon
which the City may draw upon said fund shall be established in the
agreement.
D. Liability and insurance. Each agreement granted shall require the
grantee obtain and keep in effect reasonable policies of insurance, the
amounts of which shall be specified in the agreement. At the City's
request, grantee shall furnish copies of any of all policies which are in
effect from time to time.
§ 44-18 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-19
44:27
§ 44-20. Design and construction provisions.
E. Indemnification. Each agreement granted shall require that the grantee,
at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the City, its agents, officials, and employees against any and all lawsuits,
claims, demands, liabilities, losses and expenses, including court costs
and reasonable attorney fees, which arise out of or through the acts or
omissions of grantee and its agents, officials or employees. Such
indemnification shall not extend to lawsuits, claims, demands, liabilities,
losses or expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees,
which arise from the acts or omissions or gross negligence of the City or
its agents, officials or employees.
A. Compliance with construction and technical standards. Grantee shall
construct, rebuild, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner
consistent with state, federal and local laws and ordinances, (FCC)
technical standards, and the agreement. Unless the agreement specifies
otherwise, the system shall be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained for 24 hours-a-day continuous operation.
B. City approval of construction plans. Other than for repairs or
replacements, prior to the erection of any towers or poles or the
placement of conduits or the upgrade or rebuild of the cable system
under this chapter, to the extent any of the above acts occur within the
public rights-of-way, the grantee shall first submit to the City for
approval a concise description of the facilities proposed to be erected or
installed, including engineering drawings, if required, together with a
map and plans indicating the proposed location of all such facilities. No
such work shall be commenced by any person until said approval has
been received from the City.
C. Contractor qualifications. Any contractor proposed for work of
construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and repair of system
equipment must be properly licensed under laws of the state and City
ordinances, if any.
D. Minimum interference. The grantee's system and associated equipment
erected by the grantee within the City shall be so located as to cause
minimum interference with the proper use of streets and to cause
minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners who adjoin any of the said streets.
E. City maps. The City does not guarantee the accuracy of any maps
showing the horizontal or vertical location of existing substructures. In
public rights-of-way, where necessary, the location shall be verified by
excavation.
F. Quality of construction. Construction, installation, operation, and
maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and
workmanlike manner, in accordance with then current technological
standards and the manufacturer's specifications. All cables and wires
§ 44-19 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-20
44:28
§ 44-21. Use of streets.
shall be installed, where possible, parallel with electric and telephone
lines. Multiple cable configurations belonging to the grantee shall be
arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect for aesthetic and
engineering considerations.
G. Construction standards. The construction, installation, operation,
maintenance, and/or removal of the cable system shall meet all
applicable standards within the National Electrical Code, National
Electrical Safety Code, AT&T Manual of Construction Procedures (Blue
Book), Bell Telephone Systems Code of Pole Line Construction, all
federal, state and municipal construction requirements, including FCC
Rules and Regulations and Utility Construction Requirements. The
system, once in place, does not have to be improved to conform to
standards which are thereafter created unless those standards so
require.
H. Right to inspection of construction. The agreement shall ensure that the
City has the right to inspect all construction or installation work
performed subject to the agreement.
I. System construction schedule. The agreement shall specify the rebuild
or the initial construction timetable.
J. Extension of service. Unless the agreement states to the contrary, the
grantee shall provide service to all dwelling units and commercial
entities requesting service within the City and any areas annexed to the
City within six months of such request.
A. Underground installation. In areas where either telephone or electric
utility facilities are aboveground at the time of installation, grantee may
install its service above ground, provided that at such time as those
other facilities are required to be placed underground by the City or are
placed underground, the grantee shall likewise place its services
underground (without additional cost to the City or to the individual
subscribers so served within the City). Where not otherwise required to
be placed underground by this chapter or the agreement, the grantee's
system shall be located underground at the request of the adjacent
property owner, provided that the excess cost over the aerial location
shall be borne by the property owner making the request. All cable
passing under the roadway shall be installed in conduit.
B. Pedestals. In any cases which pedestals housing mini-hubs, switching or
other equipment, are to be utilized, such equipment must be completely
buried beneath streets or sidewalks if similar facilities of both electric
and telephone utilities are or will concurrently be so buried. Any
pedestals or other equipment to be located in the public rights-of-way
shall comply with then-existing City and utility equipment installation
requirements. No pedestal or other equipment which will occupy more
than six square feet of the public right-of-way shall be so placed until the
§ 44-20 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-21
44:29
City so consents. All such buried equipment shall be shown in plan
and cross-section on the design plans for permits. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the provisions of this subsection shall apply to
grantee unless such requirements are uniformly and universally applied
to all providers of any telecommunications or utility services.
C. Permits. Prior to construction or alteration, either above or below ground,
the grantee shall, to the extent required by law or regulation, file plans
with the appropriate City agencies, enter into use agreements with the
utility companies, obtain all construction permits and receive written
approval of the City before proceeding.
D. Construction notice. Grantee shall give appropriate notice to the City
and affected residents within a reasonable period of time of planned
major system construction or excavation work, but in no event shall such
notice be given less than five days before such commencement.
E. Restoration to prior condition. If the grantee's actions result in any
disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway or soil, the grantee shall,
at its own expense and in a manner approved by the City, replace and
restore said surface in as good a condition as before said disturbance
occurred. Such restoration shall be undertaken and completed as soon
as practicable.
F. Private property. Grantee shall repair or replace all private property, both
real and personal, damaged or destroyed as a result of the construction,
installation, operating or maintenance of the cable system at its sole
cost and expense and as soon as practicable.
G. Cooperation with building movers. The grantee shall, on the request of
any person holding a building moving permit issued by the City,
temporarily raise or lower its wire to permit the moving of buildings. The
expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be
paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the
authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be
given not less than 30 working days' advance notice to arrange for such
temporary wire changes.
H. Tree trimming. Grantee may, at its own expense, trim trees or other
vegetation owned by the City (or which exist within the right-of-way) to
prevent branches, leaves or roots from touching or otherwise interfering
with its wires, cables, or other structures as approved by the City and
consistent with City ordinances; grantee shall remove any such
trimmings within a reasonable time.
I. Easements. All necessary easements over and under private property
shall be obtained by the grantee.
J. Construction and installation manual. Grantee shall provide the City with
a copy of grantee's manual which sets forth the specifications, standards
and procedures for construction and installation of its cable system. Said
§ 44-21 KALAMAZOO CODE § 44-21
44:30
§ 44-22. Conduit.
manual shall, at a minimum, establish procedures to ensure quality work
and provide for the safety and protection of residents and property.
K. Equipment changes. Unless the City agrees to the contrary in writing,
any substitution or changes in hardware components over the items
specified in the agreement must be of equivalent or better capability as
that originally specified.
L. Encumbrance. Grantee shall not open, distribute or encumber, at any
one time, any more public rights-of-way than may reasonably be
necessary to enable grantee to economically install or repair its facilities;
nor shall grantee permit any public rights-of-way to remain open,
disturbed or encumbered for a longer period of time than is reasonably
necessary.
M. Vacation. If a public right-of-way is vacated, eliminated, discontinued, or
closed, all rights of grantee under this agreement to use same shall
terminate and grantee at its expense shall immediately remove the
telecommunications and/or cable system from such public right-of-way
unless grantee obtains any necessary easements from the affected
property owners to use the former public right-of-way.
N. Disconnect and relocation. Grantee shall protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate or remove its system facilities which exist within the
public rights-of-way if, in the reasonable judgment of the City, it is
necessary for the public safety or to facilitate street construction or
other public improvements. Such acts shall be at the grantee's sole cost
and expense so long as the same policy is imposed upon all other users
of the rights-of-way.
O. Underground construction. Grantee shall comply with all state, federal
and local laws and ordinances regarding underground construction,
including that which relate to MISS DIG. If grantee damages any City
water, sewage or drainage lines, or any other City property, during the
course of construction, grantee shall be responsible for the cost of
repair, which sums may be recovered from bonds provided by the
grantee for the benefit of the City.
A. Approval for conduit. No conduit shall be installed by the grantee without
prior approval of the City with regard to location and any other pertinent
aspect.
B. Use of existing conduit. Where conduit already exists for use and is
available for use by the grantee, but grantee does not make
arrangements for such use, the City may require the grantee to use such
conduit if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby and if a similar demand is made upon electric or telephone
entities with similar underground facilities, and if grantee is able to gain
access under commercially reasonable terms.
§ 44-21 KALAMAZOO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS § 44-23
44:31
§ 44-23. Service provisions.
§ 44-24. Operation after termination or expiration of agreement.
A. Programming. Concurrently with the activation of the cable system in
the City, the grantee shall provide at all times the following services to
its subscribers:
(1) A basic service tier.
(2) Access channels for government, educational, and public access,
the number of which shall be specified in the agreement.
(3) If grantee offers an electronic and/or printed channel guide to
subscribers and is capable of providing local program listings, and
listings of local access programs are provided by the City in a timely
manner, the grantee shall ensure that the City-provided listings are
carried on a daily basis. Additional costs of providing these services
may be passed through to subscribers.
(4) Services, facilities and equipment for public, educational, and
government access, as specified in the agreement.
B. Institutional network. The grantee shall provide a separate institutional
network, equipment, and/or services and capacity, in addition to the
residential subscriber network, as specified in the agreement.
A. Subscription rights. It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive
continuous, uninterrupted service insofar as their financial contractual
and legal obligations to the grantee are honored.
B. Failure to provide continuity. In the event the grantee fails to operate the
system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of the City or
without just cause, the City may, at its option, operate the system or
designate an operator until such time as grantee restores service under
conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent operator is selected. If
the City is required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee
shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of
revenues from the system received by the City that are the result of the
grantee's failure to perform.
C. Extended operation. In the event the agreement is terminated, or upon
its expiration, the Commission may require the grantee to continue
operation for a period not exceeding 12 months after the date of the
grantee's termination or expiration, grantee shall remove, at its own
expense, its system facilities from all public rights-of-way and shall
maintain bonds until the conclusion of all operations under that
agreement and this chapter, including said removal of facilities.

§ 45-2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 46-2
46:35
A. Purpose.
(1) In the development and execution of this chapter, it is recognized
that there are some uses, known as "adult regulated uses" or
"sexually oriented businesses," which, because of their nature, have
serious objectionable operational characteristics. Special regulation
of these uses is necessary to prevent the adverse secondary effects
associated with such enterprises. The controls contained within this
chapter are for the purpose of preventing the negative secondary
effects associated with sexually oriented businesses.
(2) It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the City.
The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable
access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to
their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this
chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
B. Findings.
(1) This chapter is based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses that is within the common knowledge of municipalities
and is widely reported in judicial opinions, media reports, land use
studies, and crime impact reports made available to the City
Commission, several of which are set forth herein. Additionally, the
City Commission relies on repeated judicial findings of
municipalities' reasonable reliance on this body of secondary effects
evidence to support time, place, and manner regulations of sexually
oriented businesses. The Commission relies upon and incorporates
the findings of secondary effects discussed in the following nonexhaustive
list of cases from the U.S. Supreme Court: Pap's A.M. v.
City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda
Books, Inc., 122 S. Ct. 1728 (2002); City of Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres,
426 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); California
v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972).
(2) The Commission also relies on relevant decisions of federal
appellate and trial courts: DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d
403 (6th Cir. 1997); Currence v. City of Cincinnati, 2002 U.S. App.
LEXIS 1258; Broadway Books v. Roberts, 642 F.Supp. 486 (E.D. Tenn.

Ky. 1993); Richland Bookmart v. Nichols, 137 F.3d 435 (6th Cir.
1998); Center for Fair Public Policy v. Maricopa County, 2003 U.S.
App. LEXIS 14918 (9th Cir. July 28, 2003); Deja vu v. Metro
Government, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 535 (6th Cir. 1999); Bamon Corp.
v. City of Dayton, 7923 F.2d 470 (6th Cir. 1991); Triplett Grille,
Inc. v. City of Akron, 40 F.3d 129 (6th Cir. 1994); O'Connor v. City
and County of Denver, 894 F.2d 1210 (10th Cir. 1990); Deja vu of
Nashville, Inc., et al. v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and
Davidson County, 274 F.3d 377 (6th Cir. 2001); Z.J. Gifts D—2, L.L.C.
v. City of Aurora, 136 F.3d 683 (10th Cir. 1998); ILQ Investments, Inc.
v. City of Rochester, 25 F.3d 1413 (8th Cir. 1994); World Wide Video
of Spokane, Inc. v. City of Spokane, 227 F.3d 1143 (E.D.Wash. 2002);
Threesome Entertainment v. Strittmather, 4 F. Supp. 2d 710 (N.D.
Ohio 1998); Kentucky Restaurant Concepts, Inc. v. City of Louisville
and Jefferson County, 209 F.Supp.2d 672 (W.D. Ky. 2002).
(3) Additionally, the Commission expressly relies upon Michigan cases
relating to adult businesses, municipal regulatory authority, and
public nuisances including, but not limited to, the following cases:
Rental Property Owners Association of Kent County v. City of Grand
Rapids, 455 Mich. 246, 566 N.W.2d 514 (1996); Michigan ex rel
Wayne County Prosecutor v. Dizzy Duck, 449 Mich. 353, 535 N.W.2d
178 (1995); City of Warren v. Executive Art Studio, 1998 Mich. App.
LEXIS 2258 (1998); Tally v. City of Detroit, 54 Mich. App. 328 (1974);
Jott, Inc. v. Clinton Township, 224 Mich. App. 513 (1997). The
Commission also relies upon media reports that document the
harms associated with adult businesses: See, e.g., Muskegon Man
Convicted in Beating Death of Adult Bookstore Manager, Associated
Press State & Local Wire, September 9, 1999; Katie Merx, X-rated
Inkster Theater Razed: Officials, Cops, Residents Cheer Demolition
of Melody, An Embarrassment for 22 Years, The Detroit News,
August 19, 1999, at D3 (discussing documented sexual activity in
and around adult business); Craig Garrett, Suburbs Declare War on
Smut Shops, The Detroit News, June 30, 1999, at Al (describing how
adult theater patrons would solicit young people in the area for sex);
Justin Hyde, Warren Leaders Want to Pursue Product Liability Against
Porn Shop, Associated Press State & Local Wire, February 4, 1999
(child rapist arrested in peep show establishment).
(4) The Commission further relies on reports concerning secondary
effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses,
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona — 1984; Minneapolis,
Minnesota — 1980; Houston, Texas — 1997; Indianapolis, Indiana —
1984; Amarillo, Texas — 1977; Garden Grove, California — 1991; Los
Angeles, California — 1977; Whittier, California — 1978; Austin,
Texas — 1986; Seattle, Washington — 1989; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma — 1986; Cleveland, Ohio — 1977; Dallas, Texas — 1997;
McCleary Report, Alliance, Ohio — 2002; Tucson, Arizona — 1990;
Testimony, Warner-Robins, Georgia — 2000; St. Croix County,
§ 46-2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 46-2
46:37
Wisconsin — 1993; Bellevue, Washington, — 1998; Newport News,
Virginia — 1996; St. Cloud, Minnesota — 1994; New York Times
Square study — 1994; Phoenix, Arizona — 1995-1998; and also
on findings of physical abuse from the paper entitled "Stripclubs
According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence," by
Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for
Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from "Sexually
Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David Sherman,
presented to the Michigan House Committee on Ethics and
Constitutional Law, January 12, 2000, and the Report of the Attorney
General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented
Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota). Based on the cases
and reports documenting the adverse impact of adult businesses,
the Commission finds:
(a) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial
uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary
effects including, but not limited to, personal and property
crimes, prostitution, illicit sex acts, potential spread of disease,
lewdness, public indecency, illegal drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight,
pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(b) Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at
unregulated sexually oriented businesses, especially those that
provide private or semiprivate rooms, booths, or cubicles for
view films, videos, or live sexually explicit shows.
(c) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm, which the City has a substantial government interest in
preventing and/or abating.
(d) The information received at the public forum held on March 29,
2004, and at the City Commission meeting of May 3, 2004,
confirms that the secondary effects described above and
experienced by other municipal governments do occur in and
around sexually oriented businesses located and existing in the
City of Kalamazoo and the surrounding area. The Commission
also finds that educational and artistic uses of nudity or sexual
content also occur under circumstances which do not result in
adverse secondary effects due to the time, place, or manner of
their presentation; and therefore, they require different or no
regulation. Information received at the public forum on March
29, 2004, and the City Commission meeting of May 3, 2004
supported this conclusion.

How To Use These Regulations
§ 50-0.1. Live-Work 1, Live-Work 2 and Node Districts.
A. The Live-Work 1, Live-Work 2, and Node Zoning Districts establish a set
of development regulations that focus not only on the use of the
building, but also the building's form and impact on the block. These
regulations go beyond basic setback lines and maximum height to
consider such development components as building entrance, minimum
amount of transparent windows, and both minimum and maximum
heights. This type of standard is referred to as a "form-based zoning."
These development components are compiled into Lot Types (refer to
§ 50-5.6, Lot types), and each zoning district allows for one or more lot
types. These regulations are different than the traditional zoning
regulations in the City of Kalamazoo, but they are written plainly,
organized using tables, and are clearly illustrated for ease of use.
B. To determine the zoning regulations that apply to a parcel, please follow
these steps. The Planning Division is always available to answer
questions at 269-337-8044.

requirements for
developing or
rehabbing a building
in this location?
Refer to Table 5.6-1, Lot
Types by Zoning District,
to determine which set of
development standards
is permitted, including
dimensional standards
that locate a building on
a lot and standards for
the building facades.
Review the lot type
standards in § 50-5.6,
each of which is
summarized in a table
and with illustrations.
When rehabbing an
existing building refer to
§ 50-1.4 to determine
what activities would
result in meeting the
requirements of Chapter
50.

(1) Commercial lot type: a lot type with a high level of transparency on
the ground floor that is located at or near the front property line of a
lot. This type is ideal for active ground floor uses, such as retail or a
community center, and a mix of uses including residential and
commercial on upper stories.
(2) Flex lot type: a lot type that promotes buildings constructed in a
narrow front build-to zone with a range of entrance treatments that
can support a wide variety of uses, including commercial, industrial,
and residential.
(3) Civic lot type: a lot type that allows for the development of unique
buildings for civic and institutional uses through flexible building
siting and facade treatment standards.
(4) Warehouse lot type: a lot type that maintains the urban character of
an area while considering the needs of commercial and industrial
uses. This type's standards include limited entrance treatments
requirements.
(5) Yard lot type: a lot type that promotes the development of buildings
that are slightly set back from the front property line; most
commonly contains residential uses. It allows for the development of
a single building, attached buildings, or multiple buildings, including
what is commonly known as a "bungalow court."
(6) Outdoor market type: a lot type that focuses on the use of outdoor
spaces on a lot for such uses as gardening, seating, dining,
gathering, and retail. May include limited indoor areas in
§ 50-5.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 50-5.6

Zoning Overlay Standards
[Added 5-20-2019 by Ord. No. 1984]
§ 50-6.1. Overlay district requirements.
§ 50-6.2. Natural Features Protection Overlay standards.
A. Applicability. Overlay districts are applied to parcels in addition to the
base or underlying zoning district as mapped on the Zoning Map. Unless
otherwise provided, an overlay zoning district shall include and be
applicable to whole parcels and any parcels subsequently joined or
combined with a parcel subject to any overlay zone regulations.
B. Intent. Overlay districts provide an additional set of requirements for the
development and use of parcels within the overlay.
C. Conflict. If a conflict arises between the overlay district regulations and
those of the base zoning district, the overlay district regulations control.
A. Intent. The NFP Overlay District is intended to protect natural features in
the City of Kalamazoo, specifically wetlands, water resources, trees,
woodlands, floodplains, slopes, natural heritage areas, and habitat
corridors.
B. Applicability. The NFP Overlay District standards apply as follows.
(1) The natural features standards are divided by defined natural
feature. When a parcel is developed, redeveloped, or the natural
feature is impacted due to any site alterations, the standards for all
applicable natural features are applied.
(2) The site development standards shall be applied to all parcels in the
NFP Overlay District.
(3) Overlay standards shall not eliminate the need to obtain a permit
from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) or
any other state, federal, or regional permitting agency, if required.
(4) Structures existing on the effective date of the ordinance creating
the NFP Overlay District that do not meet the setbacks required in
this article are permitted and may be altered or expanded, provided
that they do not increase the amount of their nonconformance with
the standards in this article.
C. Natural feature standards: wetlands. A wetland is any area, regardless of
parcel boundaries, that is characterized by the presence of water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support wetland vegetation or
aquatic life, or otherwise defined in Part 301 of the NREPA.156
156. Editor's Note: See MCLA § 324.301.
§ 50-6.1 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 50-6.2
46:6-1
(1) Wetland determination. If any area on a parcel appears to be
supporting wetland vegetation or is identified on the National
Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Map, one of the following is required.
(a) The area in question shall be treated as a wetland and the
standards of this section apply.
(b) A wetland determination shall be completed by a qualified
professional, such as a professional wetland scientist to confirm
whether the area in question is a wetland.
(2) Altering a wetland. Alteration of a wetland is prohibited except as
allowed by the NREPA. A copy of any required permits obtained from
the state to alter a wetland must be submitted to the City.
(3) Wetland setbacks. Setback distance is measured from the outer
edge of wetland vegetation. Refer to Figure 6.2-1, Measuring
Wetland and Water Resource Setbacks, and Figure 6.2-2, Setbacks
Across Parcel Boundaries.
(a) The size of the wetland setback is based on the size of the
parent parcel following the distances in Table 6.2-1, Wetland
and Water Resources Setbacks.
Table 6.2-1
Wetland and Water Resources Setbacks
Size of Parent Parcel
(acre)

1/2 to 1 20
Less than 1/2 15
§ 50-6.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 50-6.2
46:6-2
(b) Prohibited activities. The following activities are prohibited in
the setback:
[1] Development activities, such as structures, impervious
surfaces, parking, driveways, etc.
[2] New stormwater BMPs.
(c) Permitted activities. The following activities are permitted in the
setback:
[1] Water and sewer lines, utility lines, bridge abutments or
approaches, or semipervious, nonmotorized trailways may
be developed and maintained within a wetland setback
with approval from all applicable local, state, and/or federal
agencies.
[2] Restoration activities, such as planting with native
vegetation with approval from all applicable local, state,
and/or federal agencies.
[3] Mitigation activities required under the NREPA.
(4) Protection during construction. Appropriate erosion control
measures must be used according to Chapter 30 of the Kalamazoo
City Code.
D. Natural feature standards: water resources. A water resource is any lake,
pond, or impoundment; a river, stream, or creek which may or may not
be serving as a drain; or any other body of water that has defined banks,
a bed, and visible evidence of a continued flow or continued occurrence
of water, or as otherwise defined in Part 301 of the NREPA.157
(1) Altering a water resource. Alteration to a water resource is
prohibited except as allowed by the NREPA. A copy of any required
permits obtained from the state to alter a water resource must be
submitted to the City.
(2) Water resource setbacks. Setback distance is measured from the
ordinary high-water mark of all water resources, including when the
water resource is located off the parcel but within the setback
distance. Refer to Figure 6.2-1, Measuring Wetland and Water
Resource Setbacks, and Figure 6.2-2, Setbacks Across Parcel
Boundaries.158
(a) The size of the water resource setback is based on the size of
the parent parcel following the distances in Table 6.2-1, Wetland
and Water Resources Setbacks.159
157. Editor's Note: See MCLA § 324.301.
158. Editor's Note: Figures 6.2-1 and 6.2.2 are included in Subsection C(3).
159. Editor's Note: Table 6.2-1 is included in Subsection C(3)(a).
§ 50-6.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 50-6.2
46:6-3
(b) Prohibited activities. The following activities are prohibited in
the setback:
[1] Development activities, such as structures, impervious
surfaces, parking, driveways, etc.
[2] New stormwater BMPs.
(c) Permitted activities. The following activities are permitted in the
setback:
[1] Up to 20% of the setback area may be developed with
semipervious materials, such as paths or mowed turf grass.
[2] Water and sewer lines, utility lines, bridge abutments or
approaches, or semipervious, nonmotorized trailways may
be developed and maintained within a water resource
setback with approval from all applicable local, state, and/
or federal agencies.
[3] Disturbance to the bank or shoreline, as expressly allowed
under state law, is permitted when a restoration plan is
prepared by a qualified professional, such as a Michigan
certified natural shoreline professional or professional
engineer.
[4] Operation and maintenance of existing flood control
facilities or stormwater BMPs.
(3) Required planting. The setback must contain natural vegetation,
including a combination of trees, shrubs, grasses, and forbs to form
a vegetated buffer in a riparian area. The vegetated buffer must
meet one of the following:
(a) Where the bank or shoreline contains natural vegetation:
[1] Existing vegetation must remain undisturbed during and
after construction activities.
[2] Supplemental planting or seeding is allowed when native
species are used. Mowed turf grass does not qualify as
natural vegetation.
[3] Removal of invasive species and/or dead or diseased
woody species is allowed, if they are replaced according to
the parameters in § 50-6.2D(3)(b)[3].
(b) Where the bank or shoreline is not covered in natural
vegetation:
[1] A vegetated buffer must be planted and maintained in the
setback.
§ 50-6.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 50-6.2
46:6-4
[2] Soil preparation for planting is allowed with proper soil
erosion controls.
[3] A diverse mix of appropriate native species is required, as
follows:
[a] At least 12 different species must be planted.
[b] At least two species from each of the following plant
types must be planted: shrubs, graminoids, and forbs.

B. Incorporated by Reference. The Zone District Map and all the notations
thereon are hereby incorporated by reference and made part of this
Ordinance.
C. Zone District Boundaries. Unless otherwise specified, zone district
boundaries are lot lines or the center line of streets, alleys, railroad
rights-of-way, or such lines extended. Where a zone district boundary
divides a land parcel under a single ownership into two or more zone
districts, then the entire parcel shall be zoned to the district that consists
of the most land area on the entire parcel. Boundaries indicated as
parallel to, or extensions of, features indicated above shall be so
construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zone
District Map shall be determined by the scale of the map, if not indicated
in the text of this Ordinance. Where physical or natural features existing
on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Zone District
Map, or in other circumstances are not covered above, the City Planner
shall interpret the zone district boundaries. This paragraph shall not
apply to any parcel that was purposefully rezoned in a manner where a
zone district boundary divides a land parcel for the purpose of providing
a buffer between land uses. [Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
D. Boundary Disputes. The City Planner shall have the authority to interpret
the Zone District Map and determine where the boundaries of the
different zone districts fall, if in dispute. The interpretation of the district
boundaries by the City Planner may be appealed to the Zoning Board of
Appeals pursuant to § 8.3F: Appeals of Administrative Decisions.
E. Changes to Zone District Map. Changes made in zone district boundaries
or other matters portrayed on the Zone District Map shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance (See § 8.3B:
Amendments to Text of Ordinance or Zone District Map). Changes shall
be entered on the Zone District Map promptly after the amendment has
been approved by the City Commission with an entry on the Zone
District Map. No amendment to this Ordinance that involves matters
portrayed on the Zone District Map shall become effective until after
§ 1.7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 1.8
46:1-4
§ 1.9. Transitional Provisions.
such change entries are made on the Zone District Map by the City
Planner.
A. Violations Continue. Any violation occurring under the previous Zoning
Ordinance, which was repealed on October 18, 2005, will continue to be
a violation under this Ordinance and be subject to penalties and
enforcement pursuant to Chapter 10: Violations, Penalties and
Enforcement, unless the use, development, construction, or other
activity complies with the provisions of this Ordinance.
B. Nonconformities Under Prior Ordinance. Any nonconformity under the
previous Zoning Ordinance, which was repealed on October 18, 2005,
will also be a legal nonconformity under this Ordinance, as long as the
situation that resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous
Ordinance continues to exist If a nonconformity under the previous
Ordinance becomes conforming because of the adoption of this
Ordinance, then the situation will no longer be a nonconformity.
C. Approved Projects.
1. Validity. Except for Planned Unit Developments approved prior to
October 18, 2005 (See § 1.9D: Planned Unit Developments
Approved Prior to October 18, 2005), permits and approvals that are
valid on October 18, 2005 shall remain valid until their expiration
date. Projects with valid approvals or permits may be carried out in
accordance with the development standards in effect at the time of
approval, provided that the permit or approval is valid and has not
lapsed.
2. Changes. No provision of this Ordinance shall require any change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any structure for which
a building permit has been issued prior to October 18, 2005.
3. Extensions. The decision-making body that granted original
approval may renew or extend the time of a previous approval if the
required findings or standards for approval remain valid. Any
extension granted shall not exceed the time specified for the
extension of the specific permit approval in Chapter 8: Review and
Approval Procedures.
4. Reapplication. Any reapplication for an expired project approval
shall meet the standards in effect at the time of re-application.
D. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) Approved Prior to October 18, 2005.
1. Final approval required. Any Planned Unit Development (PUD)
approved prior to October 18, 2005, shall remain valid until its
expiration date if it has received final approval for at least one phase
of the PUD prior to October 18, 2005. PUDs that receive final
approval for at least one phase of the PUD prior to October 18, 2005
§ 1.8 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 1.9
46:1-5
may be carried out in accordance with the development standards
in effect prior to such date.
2. Final approval not granted. If a PUD approved prior to October 18,
2005 fails to receive final approval for at least one phase of the PUD
within 12 months after October 18, 2005, the PUD Plan, and PUD
Agreement if applicable, shall lapse and become invalid. Prior to
proceeding with any development within such PUD Overlay zone

§ 2.1 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 2.2
46:2-1
§ 2.2. R, Residential Districts.
All residential zoning district names begin with the letter “R,” which is a
short-hand reference to “residential.” The second letter of all “R” district
map symbols (other than the RMHP district) provides an indication of the
primary characteristic of the district —”S” for single-dwelling, “D” for duplex,
and “M” for multi-dwelling. Residential districts that end with a number
provide a short-hand reference to the maximum density allowed in the
district (expressed in terms of the number of dwelling units allowed per acre
of land area). The RM-15 district, for example, is a residential zoning district
that is primarily intended for multi-unit building types, with a maximum
allowed density of 15 units per acre.
A. RS, Residential Single-Dwelling Districts.
1. Description and Purpose. The primary purpose of the RS districts is
to accommodate the development of single dwelling units on
individual lots. The districts are intended to create, maintain and
promote primarily owner-occupied housing, although they do permit
nonresidential uses that are compatible with residential
neighborhoods.
2. Allowed Uses. See § 4.1: Use Table165, for a list of uses allowed in all
R districts.
3. Density/Intensity/Dimensional Standards. See § 5.1: Residential
District Standards, for the Density, Intensity and Dimensional
standards that apply in all R districts except the RMHP district.
4. Development Standards. See Chapter 6: Development Standards,
for Development Standards that apply in all the R districts.
5. Occupancy Limits in RS Districts. An owner-occupied, one-family
dwelling unit in any RS district may be occupied by a family or a
maximum of three unrelated adults. [Note: three unrelated adults
are allowed because a family may be defined as any two unrelated
adults, and a family may have one roomer (2+1=3).] The keeping of
one roomer in an owner-occupied, one-family dwelling unit that is
occupied by a family is permitted. A non-owner-occupied, one-family
dwelling unit may only be occupied by a family, or a maximum of
two unrelated adults.
B. RD, Duplex Districts.
1. Description and Purpose. The primary purpose of the RD districts is
to accommodate the development of two-family dwellings (duplexes
or attached houses) and single dwelling units on individual lots.
2. Allowed Uses. See § 4.1: Use Table, for a list of uses allowed in all R
districts.
165. Editor's Note: The Use Table is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 2.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2.2
46:2-2
3. Density/Intensity/Dimensional Standards. See § 5.1: Residential
District Standards, for the Density, Intensity and Dimensional
standards that apply in all R districts except the RMHP district.
4. Development Standards. See Chapter 6: Development Standards,
for Development Standards that apply in all the R districts.
5. Occupancy Limits in RD Districts. An owner-occupied dwelling unit in
any RD district may be occupied by a family, or a maximum of four
unrelated adults. The keeping of one roomer in an owner-occupied
dwelling unit that is occupied by a family is permitted. A non-owneroccupied
dwelling unit may only be occupied by a family or a
maximum of four unrelated adults
C. RM, Multi-Dwelling Districts.
1. Description and Purpose.
a) General. The primary purpose of the RM districts is to
accommodate the development of multi-unit housing (i.e., more
than one dwelling unit per lot). The districts are intended to
create, maintain and promote a mix of housing opportunities for
City residents.
b) RM-15C. The RM-15C district is intended to protect and enhance
those areas developed or likely to develop with mediumdensity,
multiple-family dwellings close to institutions of higher
education. The district regulations are designed to promote a
suitable environment for a variety of residential types and
provide regulations to address increased off-street parking
needs, ensure building designs that are compatible with a
campus community and prevent overcrowding. The RM-15C
district has higher parking requirements for multifamily
dwellings, to reflect the generally higher occupancy of such
units near institutions of higher education.
2. Allowed Uses. See § 4.1: Use Table, for a list of uses allowed in all R
districts.
3. Density/Intensity/Dimensional Standards. See § 5.1: Residential
District Standards, for the Density, Intensity and Dimensional
standards that apply in all R districts except the RMHP district.
4. Development Standards. See Chapter 6: Development Standards,
for Development Standards that apply in all the R districts.
5. Occupancy Limits in the RM-15C District. An owner-occupied
dwelling unit in the RM-15C district may be occupied by a family or a
maximum of six unrelated adults. The keeping of two roomers in an
owner-occupied dwelling unit that is occupied by a family is
permitted. A non-owner-occupied dwelling unit may only be
occupied by a family or a maximum of six unrelated adults.

A. P, Public District.
1. Description. The P, Public district is intended to accommodate uses
of a governmental or public service nature, including major public
facilities and parks. It offers an alternative district classification for
such uses, thereby increasing development predictability
throughout the City, especially within residential neighborhoods.
§ 2.4 KALAMAZOO CODE § 2.5
46:2-14
The district is generally intended to be applied to land owned or
otherwise controlled by the federal government, the state, the
county, the City and school districts. This designation serves a
notice function to those owning or buying land in proximity to
publicly owned land.
2. Use Regulations. See § 4.1: Use Table168, for a list of uses allowed in
the P district.
3. Density/Intensity/Dimensional Standards.
a) The density, intensity and dimensional standards of the most
restrictive abutting district apply to all areas of the P district site
located within 150 feet of the abutting district. Stricter
standards may be established at the time of site plan or special
use approval.
b) For areas of the P district site located more than 150 feet from
abutting districts, density, intensity and dimensional standards
must be established as part of the site plan or special use
approval process.
c) If no site plan or special use approval is required, no density or
dimensional standards apply to that portion of a P district site
located more than 150 feet from abutting districts.
4. Development Standards. See Chapter 6: Development Standards,
for Development Standards that apply in the P district.
B. IC, Institutional Campus District.
1. Purpose. The purpose of the IC, Institutional Campus district, is to
accommodate large institutional uses in campus-like settings, such
as colleges, schools, hospitals and large religious assemblies. The IC
district is intended to promote and enhance the development and
expansion of educational, medical and other large institutional uses,
while minimizing the adverse impacts that can result when such
uses are located near residential neighborhoods.
2. Development Review. All development within the IC district is
subject to the review and approval procedures of § 8.3C: Planned
Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) District, even though an IC
district rezoning is not a Planned Unit Development.
3. Use Regulations. See § 4.1: Use Table, for a list of uses allowed in the
IC district.
4. Density/Intensity/Dimensional Standards. Density/intensity and

for Development Standards that apply in the IC district.
6. Institutional Master Plans.
a) Purpose. Institutional Master Plan requirements are intended to
provide a framework for development of large institutional uses
in campus-like settings. Approval of an Institutional Master Plan
is intended to permit flexibility in site development and in the
design and arrangement of buildings that is not possible when
development occurs on a lot-by-lot or building-by-building
basis. In addition, it is intended that the master planning
process and resulting master plan document protect the
integrity of adjacent neighborhoods. The provisions for an
institutional master plan are intended to create efficient,
functional, and attractive areas that incorporate a high level of
amenities and meet public objectives for protection and
preservation of the natural and built environment. The
provisions are intended to ensure compatible uses and
structures within institutional master planned areas and
between institutional areas and areas adjacent to them. The
provisions are intended to prevent adverse impacts associated
with the unplanned growth of large institutions; to ensure
adequate provision for pedestrian and vehicular movement; to
provide open spaces for light, air and recreation; and to provide
for the efficient provision of utilities, services and facilities.
b) Master Planning Area. An Institutional Master Plan must be
prepared and submitted by the institution and include all area
within the IC district and an area extending out at least 300 feet
from the boundary of the IC district, unless the City Planner
establishes a different area requirement based on a review of
the following:
1) Physical area occupied or controlled by the existing
institution;
2) Trends in property values;
3) Redevelopment potential of surrounding areas;
4) Proximity of other institutional uses;
5) Condition of structures; and
6) Level of area vacancy.
c) Planning Requirements. An institutional master plan must, at a
minimum, include the following information unless the City
Planner determines that such information is not necessary to
evaluate the proposed master plan and the institution's future
impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.

A. The overlay districts of this chapter are intended to apply in combination
with the underlying base district to impose regulations and standards
that address special geographic areas or land use issues.
B. In the event of conflict between overlay district regulations and the
regulations of the underlying (base) district, the overlay district
regulations govern. In all other cases, both the overlay district and base
district regulations apply.
C. Overlay districts are established in accordance with the Zoning Map
Amendment procedures of § 8.3B, Amendments to Text of Ordinance or
District Map.

Conservation Overlay District
Name
Boundaries
A. Description. The THD-O Traditional Housing Density Overlay district is
intended to stabilize and preserve the character of the neighborhoods
without downzoning and without creating widespread nonconformities.
B. Use Regulations. The uses allowed in the underlying district are allowed
in the THD-O district.
C. Density/Intensity/Dimensional Standards. The Density/Intensity and
Development standards of the underlying zoning district apply to
development within the THD-O district.
D. Existing Uses.
1. All legally conforming established residential uses in existence on
October 18, 2005, will be considered conforming under this
Ordinance. Any residential building (legally conforming or legally
nonconforming) may be rebuilt with the same number of dwelling
units, but it may not be rebuilt to contain a greater number of
dwelling units than (a) the number of dwelling units that existed at
the time of its demolition, or (b) the number of dwelling units
allowed by the density and dimensional standards of the underlying
zoning district, whichever is greater.
2. If a structure in the THD-O district contains more residential dwelling
unit than are permitted by the density/intensity standards of Secs.
5.1 or 5.2 (as applicable), and one or more of such dwelling units are
§ 3.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.3
46:3-4
§ 3.4. PUD-O, Planned Unit Development Overlay District.
A Planned Unit Development Overlay district may be approved for
residential, commercial, public, or industrial development, or for a mix of
such uses, pursuant to the following standards and requirements.
later removed from the structure through remodeling, renovation,
or any other means, then such dwelling units may not subsequently
be re-constructed or otherwise made available for occupancy as a
separate dwelling unit unless the residential structure would still
comply with the standards of § 5.1 or 5.2 (as applicable) after such
re-construction, remodeling, or occupancy. Once a dwelling unit that
would not be permitted under the density/intensity standards of
§ 5.1 or 5.2 is removed from a structure by any means, it may not be
re-constructed or made available for occupancy through any means.
3. Any conforming building containing a conforming use that has been
destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, or Act of God may be
rebuilt to its pre-damage state, notwithstanding the requirements of
§ 9.2: Nonconforming Uses.
A. Purpose. The PUD-O, Planned Unit Development Overlay District
regulations are intended to:
1. Promote consistency with the Comprehensive Plan;
2. Promote development that can be conveniently, efficiently and
economically served by existing and planned utilities and services;
3. Promote design flexibility that results in greater public benefits than
could be achieved using conventional district regulations;
4. Encourage the preservation of environmental and historic
resources;
5. Promote a mix of attractive and functional residential and
nonresidential developments that are compatible with surrounding
development.
B. Development Review and Approval. A PUD-O district may be approved
only when the City Commission determines that a proposed Planned Unit
Development complies with all the relevant and appropriate standards of
§ 3.4H: Standards, the procedures of § 8.3C: Planned Unit Development
Overlay (PUD-O) District, and would result in a greater benefit to the City
than would development under conventional district regulations.
C. Developer's Statement. Each PUD-O application must include a
comparison of the proposed development with the standards of
underlying district and the otherwise applicable standards of this
Ordinance. Applications must also include a statement by the applicant
describing how the proposed development provides greater benefits to
§ 3.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.4

Ord. No. 1825]
the City than would a development carried out in accordance with
otherwise applicable district and development standards.
D. Effect of other District Standards. Except as expressly authorized by the
regulations of this section and approved as part of a PUD Plan (in
accordance with the procedures of § 8.3C: Planned Unit Development
Overlay (PUD-O) District), all of the standards of this Ordinance apply to
development within a PUD-O district.
E. Minimum Land Area. A PUD-O district classification containing only
residential and related land uses may only be applied to lands that
comprise a minimum of five contiguous acres in area, or a contiguous
city block, whichever is less. A PUD O district classification containing
commercial uses or a mix of commercial and residential uses may be
applied without a minimum area requirement.
F. Location. A PUD-O zoning classification may be established on any land
located in the City that complies with all of the applicable standards of
this section.
G. Unified Ownership or Control. The title to all land that is part of a PUD-O
district classification containing only residential and related land uses
must be owned or controlled by one person at the time of application
and approval. A person will be considered to control all lands in the PUDO
district either through ownership or by written consent of all owners of
land within the proposed PUD-O district boundary that is subject to the
conditions and standards of the adopting ordinance, the PUD Plan and
PUD-O District Agreement. A PUD-O district classification containing
commercial uses or a mix of commercial and residential uses need not
be owned or controlled by one person at the time of application and
approval.
H. Standards. All development in a PUD-O district shall comply with (1) all
provisions of this Code applicable to the underlying zone district unless
such provisions are expressly varied by the terms of the PUD Plan. In
addition, before approving a PUD-O district classification, the City
Commission must find that the PUD Plan and district classification
complies with those standards identified in § 8.3C.7: Planned Unit
Development Overlay (PUD-O) Zone District. The City may require
additional building design standards, landscaping standards and site
development standards to ensure that a PUD-O classification containing
commercial uses or a mix of commercial and residential uses are
compatible with and enhance the appearance of surrounding areas.

demonstrated that the well will not cause an adverse impact to the
public water supply;
8. Use any private well if said use is likely to cause an adverse impact
to the public water supply;
9. Excavate, extract, or mine sand, gravel, bedrock or any other type
of earth if a permit or site plan review is required unless the property
owner has established, to the Department's satisfaction, that the
activity will not cause an adverse impact to the public water supply;
10. Allow the presence of an abandoned well, which is defined as any
well which has either been discontinued for more than one year, is in
such disrepair that its continued use for obtaining groundwater is
impractical, has been left uncompleted, is a threat to groundwater
resources, or is a health or safety hazard. A well shall not be
considered abandoned if it has been properly plugged pursuant to
The Groundwater Quality Control Act, Part 127, 1978 PA 368; or
11. Drill for natural gas or petroleum, whether for exploration,
production or otherwise.
E. Prohibitions Within One-Year Time-of-Travel (TOT) Capture Zone. Within a
one-year time-of-travel capture zone, no person shall, nor cause or allow
another over whom he/she or she has control to:
1. Engage in any activity prohibited in the ten-Year TOT Capture Zone;
2. Possess regulated substances, including fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel,
kerosene, etc.), exceeding 55 gallons aggregate for liquid materials
§ 3.5 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.5

or 440 pounds aggregate for dry weights, such as sometimes occurs
with activities such as fueling service establishments, motor vehicle
repair, body repair; trucking or bus terminals; primary metal product
industries; metal plating, polishing, etching, engraving, anodizing or
similar processes; lawn, garden, pesticide and agricultural services
with on-site bulk mixing or blending of fertilizers, pesticides and
other industry-related chemicals for commercial application; and
dry-cleaning facilities with on-site cleaning service; or
3. Construct or replace any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or
other facility intended or used for the disposal of domestic or nondomestic
wastewater.
F. Well Isolation Distance Restrictions. Within either capture zone, no
person shall cause or allow uses or activities that would violate the terms
and conditions set forth in the document "Minimum Well Isolation
Distances (From Contamination Sources and Buildings), Part 127, Act
368, P.A. 1978 and Act 399, PA 1976" as prepared by the MDEQ, Water
Division, as it may be amended, which, for the purpose of this section,
shall be deemed to apply to all persons, unless approved in writing by
the Department Director or his or her designee.
G. Determination of Capture Zone Boundaries. In determining whether a
property is within a capture zone, the following shall apply:
1. Where a capture zone line that delineates the boundary of one or
more zones passes through a property, the entire parcel shall be
subject to the restrictions that apply to the more restrictive zone.
2. The Environmental Services Superintendent, or his or her designee,
shall have the authority to interpret the capture zone and determine
where the boundaries of the different zones fall, if in dispute. Said
interpretation may be appealed to the Director.
H. Continuation of Existing Nonconforming Facilities and Land Uses.
1. Existing nonconformities for land uses/activities will be allowed
within a capture zone only if in accordance with Chapter 9,
"Nonconformities," of Appendix A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City of
Kalamazoo Code of Ordinances.
2. In addition, the facility must meet the requirements of the
"Performance Standards" and/or shall prepare a Spill Contingency
Plan within two years from the adoption date of this ordinance or
one year from the date of contact from the City regarding
recognition of nonconforming status, whichever is sooner. The City
reserves the right to approve/determine which option(s) is to be
implemented for the specific circumstance.
I. Requirements Regarding Release of Regulated Substance.
§ 3.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.5
46:3-11
1. Upon discovery of a release within a capture zone, the owner and
person in control of the property on which a release occurred, as
well as the person responsible for the release, shall take appropriate
reasonable actions to mitigate the potential impact of the release on
groundwater and remediate the release. Remediation must be
conducted in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable
law. Wastes generated during remediation of a regulated substance
release must be handled in accordance with all applicable legal
requirements. Storage of these materials for a period of greater than
90 days must be reported to, and approval obtained from, the
Environmental Services Superintendent or designee by said
persons.
2. All releases shall be documented in writing and mailed to the
Department within 10 business days of said incident. Initial release
notification shall include, at a minimum, the following:
a) Location of the release (name, address, and phone);
b) Reporting party's name, address, and phone (if different from
above);
c) Emergency contact and phone;
d) Description of the nature of the incident, including date, time,
location, and cause of the incident; type, concentration, and
volume of substance(s) released;
e) Map showing exact release location, and relevant site features
(i.e., paved area, storm sewer catch basins/inlets, water
features, etc.), scale, and North arrow;
f) All measures taken to clean up the release; and
g) All measures proposed to be taken to reduce and prevent any
future release.
3. The Environmental Services Superintendent or his/her designee
shall use the Regulated Substance Release Report to determine if
and where any additional investigative work needs to be completed
to assess the potential impact of the release. The owner or operator
shall retain a copy of the written notice for at least three years.
J. Inactive Operations. This section applies to any business or other
operation ("operation") that is inactive, is within a capture zone, and at
which there are regulated substances. For purposes of this section,
"inactive" is defined to include those businesses/operations that are
unoccupied and have no activity for at least 30 days. Those who own or
control such an inactive operation shall do the following:
1. Within seven days of the operation becoming inactive, take such
steps as necessary to secure the site such that vandals and all other
persons cannot gain access to the regulated substances;
§ 3.5 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.5
46:3-12
2. Within 30 days of the operation becoming inactive, provide to the
Superintendent a document that identifies the site, the date of
inactivity, the regulated substances that exist on site, and the
name, address and telephone number of both the owner and the
person in control of the site; and
3. Within six months of the operation becoming inactive, remove all
regulated substances from the site; this does not include those
substances used for heating, cooling, or electrical lighting.
K. Enforcement.
1. Whenever the Department determines that a person has violated a
provision of this Ordinance, the Department may order compliance
by issuing a written Notice of Violation to the responsible person/
facility.
2. If the Department requires abatement of a violation and/or
restoration of affected property, the notice shall set forth a deadline
by which such action must be completed. Said notice may further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, the work will be performed by the
Department, with the resulting expense thereof charged to the
violator.
L. Variance/Appeal Rights.
1. If an owner of property within a capture zone believes the
requirements of this ordinance impose an unreasonable burden on
the use of the owner's property, the owner may seek a variance
from the Department Director (or his or her designee). Such a
request must be in writing with enough detail to allow the Director to
understand the situation and proposed variance. If the Director
determines that additional information is needed, the request for
additional information shall be made within 30 days of the owner's
request. Within 30 days of the receipt of such additional information,
or, if no such request is made, within 30 days of the owner's request,
the Director shall issue a written response to the owner. The
response shall grant, deny, or partially grant the request. A grant,
partial or complete, may relieve the property owner from strict
compliance with this ordinance. Reasonable conditions may be
imposed as part of such a grant. The Director shall be guided by the
primary goal of protecting the City's wellfields without creating
undue hardship upon the property owners affected.
2. Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the
determination set forth within the notice to the Department Director
by submitting a written notice of appeal to the Department. The
notice of appeal must be received by the Director within 30 days
from the date of the Notice of Violation, with enough detail to allow
the Director to understand the situation. Within 30 days of the
receipt of such an appeal the Director shall issue a written response
§ 3.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.5
46:3-13
to the appeal unless additional information is requested by the
Director, in which case the response shall issue within 30 days
of receipt of the information. The Director's response shall affirm,
reverse, or modify the Notice of Violation being appealed.
3. If the person who has made a variance request or an appeal of a
Notice of Violation does not agree with the Director's decision, said
person may appeal the matter by filing an action in the Kalamazoo
Circuit Court, which may affirm, reverse or modify the decision being
appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the
Director's final decision.
M. Abatement/Remedial Activities by the Department.
1. The Department is authorized to take or contract with others to take
reasonable and necessary abatement or remedial activities
whenever the Department determines a violation of this Ordinance
has occurred and that the responsible party cannot or will not timely
correct the violation, or when no known responsible party exists.
The responsible party shall reimburse the City for all reasonable
expenses thus incurred by the City.
2. If the City desires the responsible party to reimburse it for
reasonable abatement activity expenses, the City shall, within 90
days of the completion of said activities, mail to that person a Notice
of Claim outlining the expenses incurred, including reasonable
administrative costs, and the amounts thereof. The person billed
shall pay said sum in full within 30 days of receipt of the claim. If the
person billed desires to object to all or some of the amount sought
by the Department, said person may file, within the same thirty-day
period, a written objection so stating. The Department shall, within
30 days of its receipt of the objection, provide an opportunity for the
objecting party to present facts or arguments supporting said
objection. If the Department determines that some or the entire
amount originally billed is appropriate, the person shall pay said
sum within 30 days of receipt of that determination. If the amount
due is not timely paid, the City may cause the charges to become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien
on the property. In the alternative, the City may attempt collection
of the sum due by filing a civil lawsuit.
N. Injunctive Relief. If a person has violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this Ordinance, the Department may petition the
appropriate court for injunctive relief restraining the person from
activities that would create further violations, or compelling the person
to perform necessary abatement or remediation.
O. Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to
exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance is a threat to
public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a
§ 3.5 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.5
46:3-14
§ 3.6. HP-O, Historic Preservation Overlay.
The HP-O, Historic Preservation Overlay is intended to be applied to areas
that are subject to the City's historic preservation ordinance. The regulations
that apply within the HP-O are those contained within Chapter 16, Historic
Districts, of the Kalamazoo Code of Ordinances. The local historic districts
within the City of Kalamazoo are listed below:
§ 3.7. RF-O, Riverfront Overlay. [Amended 7-31-2006 by Ord. No.
1809]
nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken by the City.
P. Criminal Prosecution. Any violation of this Ordinance shall be considered
a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or
imprisonment of not more than 90 days. Each day a violation exists shall
be deemed a separate violation. A citation charging such a misdemeanor
may be issued by the Director, his or her designee, or a member of
Public Safety.
Q. Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this Ordinance are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal,
state, or local law and it is within the discretion of the Department to
seek cumulative remedies.
1. Haymarket Historic District.
2. Rose Place Historic District.
3. South Burdick Historic District.
4. South Street/Vine Area Historic District.
5. Stuart Area Historic District.
A. Purpose. The RF-O district is intended to implement The Kalamazoo
Riverfront Redevelopment Plan (Riverfront Plan) adopted by the City on
April 14, 2003. The RF-O district has specific purposes including:
1. To protect and preserve the Kalamazoo River and its frontage for
public use, providing benefits to the entire City.
2. To encourage the redevelopment of areas adjacent to the riverfront
in an urbanist style and to strengthen connections to and from the
remainder of the City.
3. To encourage the transformation over time of certain industrial
areas towards residential and mixed use development.
§ 3.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.7
46:3-15
4. To encourage the creation of stable residential and mixed use
neighborhoods including a wide variety of residential housing types
on both the east and west sides of the Kalamazoo River.
5. To improve the quality of development throughout the area, and
particularly along higher volume streets providing public views of
the RF-O district.
6. To create a balanced and integrated transportation system that
relies less on automobiles and more on bus transit, biking, and
walking, and to create a mix of land uses and intensities that
support that balanced transportation system.
7. To encourage patterns of development that support a mix of living,
working, and recreational activities close to one another.
8. To encourage patterns of development that enclose and define
street spaces, through the use of appropriate building heights and
relatively small front setbacks.
9. To provide required parking to the rear or to the side of primary
structures wherever possible, in order to reduce auto-oriented street
frontages.
10. To encourage innovative and high quality architecture, and
exceptional landscaping, lighting, signage, fixtures, and furnishings.
B. Subareas and Intended Character. The RF-O district has been divided
into the following eight subareas, each of which is intended to achieve
the general character described below. The boundaries of each subarea
are shown on the following map.
§ 3.7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.7
46:3-16
§ 3.7 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.7
46:3-17
1. Subarea 1 (Northwest Manufacturing/Residential). Subarea 1
currently has an industrial character, but is intended to transition to
a residential area over time. All accessory scrap and salvage
operations shall be inside an enclosed structure. Residential units
should be constructed close to the street frontage of each lot to help
define and enclose street spaces.
2. Subarea 2 (West Residential). Subarea 2 is intended for future
single-family residential uses and neighborhood-specific commercial
uses, with residential units constructed close to the street frontage
of each lot to help define and enclose street spaces.
3. Subarea 3 (West Park Mixed Use). Subarea 3 is intended for future
residential and mixed uses, with structures constructed close to the
street frontage of each lot to help define and enclose street spaces
and park areas. Structures may include live/work units, residential
neighborhood commercial, and office uses, and shall be two or three
stories in height. No single-story structures shall be permitted.
4. Subareas and Intended Character, 4. Subarea 4 (Southwest
Commercial). Subarea 4 is intended for mixed use, including lowerintensity
industrial uses, as well as commercial, office, and
residential uses. High-quality design will be required, and for the
portion of Subarea 4 which falls within the boundaries of the
Downtown Development Authority, design will be guided by the
Downtown Design Review Guidelines. [Amended 1-3-2012 by
Ord. No. 1887]
5. Subarea 5 (Park). Subarea 5 is intended to be used for park areas
and open space along the Kalamazoo River. Existing homes may
remain and shall be deemed to be conforming land uses, but new
principal and accessory structures shall be required to comply with
applicable design standards.
6. Subarea 6 (Riverview Commercial). Subarea 6 is intended for mixed
use of high design quality, with commercial uses predominating. As
redevelopment occurs, parking lots shall be located behind or
beside (but not in front of) primary structures. New development
shall orient to Riverview Drive.
7. Subarea 7 (East Bank Mixed Use). Subarea 7 is intended to
accommodate an urban-style residential neighborhood with
residential uses along the river and neighborhood scale commercial
uses around the edges of the area. The amount of commercial
development shall be limited to ensure the predominantly
residential character of the area.
8. Subareas and Intended Character, 8. Subarea 8 (Southeast Mixed
Use). Subarea 8 is a highly visible location with excellent
transportation access, and is intended for redevelopment with a mix
of office, restaurants or retail uses, or general industrial uses that
§ 3.7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.7
46:3-18
are combined with restaurant or retail/commercial uses. [Amended
1-3-2012 by Ord. No. 1887]
9. Subarea 9 (South Mixed Use). Subarea 9 is a highly visible location
with excellent transportation access, and is intended for
redevelopment with a mix of office, restaurant, retail, multiplefamily,
attached housing, and mixed uses. [Added 8-6-2018 by
Ord. No. 1969]
C. Permitted Uses.
1. Different land uses are permitted in each subarea of the RF-O
district as shown in the attached Table 3.7-1. Abbreviations used in
the table shall have the same meanings assigned to them in § 4.1. A
"P" indicates that a use is permitted by right, subject to compliance
with all other applicable local, state and federal regulations,
including the regulations of this Ordinance. A "C" indicates that the
use may not be established after October 18, 2005, but if the use
was legally established and in existence on that date it may
continue to exist as a legal conforming use. An "S" indicates that a
use is allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of § 8.3D: Special Use Permit. A blank
cell indicates that the listed use is not allowed in the respective
subarea.
2. Some uses are subject to additional requirements set forth (a) in the
right-hand column of Table 3.7-1169 (which cross-references
materials in Chapter 4), and/or (b) subarea-specific use standards
set forth in § 3.7D below. In the event of any conflict between Table
3.7-1 and Table 4.2-1, the materials in Table 3.7-1 shall apply.
D. Subarea-Specific Use Regulations. The standards in this Subsection D
apply in specific subareas of the RF-O district. In the event of a conflict
between the use-specific standards in § 4.2 and the subarea-specific
standards in § 3.7D, the stricter provision shall apply. Where the
standards below reference termination or abandonment, it shall be
presumed that a termination, abandonment, or relocation has occurred if
there has been a complete cessation of the use continuously for a period
of 180 days. Maintaining of utility services or payment of taxes during
this one-hundred-eighty-day period is insufficient to overcome this
presumption unless other factors clearly showing that the use was not
terminated, abandoned, or relocated is provided to the City Planner.
1. Subarea 1 (Northwest Industrial/Residential).
a) If a use categorized as an industrial use in Table 3.7-1
terminates, is abandoned, or relocates out of Subarea 1, no
industrial use shall occupy any part of such property.

a) New residential uses may only be developed pursuant to an
overall development plan or a PUD requiring that at least six
dwelling units be developed in each phase. Residential units
may include live/work units and attached units, and all
residential units shall be two to four stories in height.
Residential units with more than four stories shall not be located
closer than 300 feet from the Kalamazoo River. No single-story
structures shall be permitted.
b) Uses categorized as industrial uses in Table 3.7-1 shall not be
permitted in Subarea 7. Uses categorized as commercial uses in
Table 3.7-1 that are not oriented towards and adjacent to
Riverview Drive or Gull Road shall only be permitted if they have
a gross floor area of less than 3,500 square feet and provide
services to residents in the immediately surrounding area.
8. Subarea 8 (Southeast Mixed Use).
a) Residential uses may be permitted as part of a mixed-use
development where ground floor uses are nonresidential.

for business uses.
§ 3.7 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.7
46:3-21
f) The street network in Subarea 9 shall have a high degree of
connectivity and shall offer multiple circulation routes within the
district and to adjacent areas.
g) Residential uses shall require that at least five dwelling units be
developed in each phase. Residential units may include live/
work units and attached units. All residential units shall be two
to four stories in height. Residential units with more than four
stories shall not be located closer than 300 feet from the
Kalamazoo River.
h) Drive-through designs will not impact the walkability of the area
and will be located to the rear or side of the building. A primary
entry from the frontage street must be maintained for
pedestrian access. Primary building face shall be located along
street frontage. Front yard may only contain café style seating,

Figure 1
E. Development and Design Standards. All new development in the RF-O
district shall comply with the following standards:
1. Street Network. The street network, including sidewalks, in the RF-O
district shall have a high degree of connectivity and shall create
multiple circulation routes both within the district and to adjacent
areas outside the RF-O district boundaries.
2. Street Design. The RF-O zone district is intended to have relatively
narrow streets in order to encourage slower automobile travel, a
friendlier pedestrian environment along the right-of-way, and to
encourage primary buildings to be built close to the street. Typical
street dimensions are illustrated below.
§ 3.7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.7
46:3-22
3. Parking. The requirements of § 6.1: Off-Street Parking and Loading,
shall apply within the RF-O zone district, except that:
a) Minimum off-street parking requirements for all uses that are
categorized as commercial uses in Table 3.7-1 and that are not
oriented to and adjacent to Riverview Drive, Michigan Avenue,
Walbridge Street, or Gull Road may be reduced by 25% to
reflect expectations of increased walkability and reduce autodependence
within the district.
b) Uses categorized as commercial uses in Table 3.7-1 may count
on-street parking spaces immediately adjacent to or directly in
front of the subject property towards the minimum off-street
parking requirements. Each qualifying on-street parking space
§ 3.7 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.7
46:3-23
shall reduce the minimum required off-street parking by 1/2
space.
4. Drive-In and Drive-Through Facilities. All drive-in and drive-through
facilities shall comply with the following standards. In the event
these standards conflict with those standards in § 6.1C.3, Stacking
Spaces for Drive-In or Drive-Through Uses, or § 6.3E, Screening of
Drive-Through Facilities, or with any other standard in this
Ordinance, these standards shall govern.
a) Service areas and stacking lanes for all new drive-in or drivethrough
facilities must be set back a minimum of five feet from
all lot lines. When abutting residential uses, a six-foot-tall,
opaque privacy fence is required to be installed on or near the
common border to screen the drive-in or drive-through facility
from the residential structure. A row of six-foot-tall evergreen
trees that provide a continuous opaque screen may be
substituted for the fence. All driveway entrances, including
stacking lane entrances, must be located at least 50 feet from
any intersection. The distance is measured along the property
line from the junction of the two street lot lines to the nearest
edge of the entrance.
b) Stacking lanes must contain a minimum of 90 feet for a single
stacking lane or 54 feet per lane when there is more than one
stacking lane. A stacking lane is measured from the curb cut to
the service area. Stacking lanes do not have to be linear.
c) When abutting residential parcels, drive-in or drive-through
facilities with noise-generating equipment must document in
advance that the facility will meet the City Noise Ordinance
regulations.171 Noise-generating equipment includes items such
as speakers and exterior air handling devices.
5. Outdoor Display Areas. Indoor retail sales and service uses may
have small outdoor display areas, with a total area not to exceed
10% of the total sales floor area. These outdoor display areas must
be located on the same parcel as the primary business location. All
outdoor display areas must be properly identified and contained,
and must be open only during store hours. Outdoor display areas
must be either removed when the retail sales and service use is
closed, or completely contained within a decorative fence at least
four feet in height. In the event these standards conflict with any
other standard in this Ordinance, these standards shall govern.
6. Dimensional Standards.172
7. Building Design Standards. All development within the RF-O zone
district shall comply with all applicable design standards in § 6.5:
171. Editor's Note: See Ch. 21, Noise.
172. Editor's Note: Table RF-O.1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 3.7 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.7
46:3-24
Design Standards, unless such standards are inconsistent with the
design standards in Subsections E7(a) through (d) below — in which
case the standards below shall govern.
a) All Development and Structures.

dedicate to the City or to public use any portion of any such
open space system or trail if the amount of such dedication
would violate state or federal law regarding development
exactions.
3) Residential garages with access from alleys are preferred.
Where lots receive garage access from the street, garages
should be designed so that the plane of the garage door is
roughly perpendicular to the street. Where a garage door(s)
is located roughly parallel to and visible from the street,
such garage door(s) shall not occupy more than 45% of the
total width of the front elevation of the residential
structure. The front plane of the garage shall not extend
closer to the street than the front plane of the primary

building exterior surfaces, including but not limited to
metal, granite, stone, terra cotta, concrete, glass, brick,
stucco, decorative concrete block, and wood clapboard.
Alternate or new materials may also be used as long as
they are compatible with the physical characteristics of the
historic materials which lend character to this area of the
City.
5) The use of the following materials requires review and
approval as set forth in Subsection E8(b) below: horizontal
or vertical rough-textured wood siding, stone and gravel

transparency would be inconsistent with the operational
requirements of the building. At least one-half of this
required amount of transparent materials shall be provided
so that the lowest edge of the transparent materials is no
higher than four feet above the street level. In areas used
to meet this transparency requirement, glazing shall have
a visible light transparency percentage of at least 60%.
• Each facade greater than 100 feet in length, measured
horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or
recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of
the facade and extending at least 20% of the length of the
facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed
100 horizontal feet. Walls whose elevations include 25% of
their surface area in balconies, patios, windows, or natural
materials shall be exempt from this requirement.

CHAPTER 4
Use Regulations
§ 4.1. Use Table.
The Use Table of this section lists the principal uses allowed within the
Base Zoning Districts. The symbols used in the Use Table are defined in the
following paragraphs.173
§ 4.2. Use-Specific Standards.
A. Adult Foster Care Family Home and Group Home. Any facility required to
be licensed by the State of Michigan or the City of Kalamazoo shall have
a valid license at all times, and it shall be a violation of this Code to
operate at any time without a valid license. Any facility with seven or
more residents must be located at least 1,500 feet from any adult foster
care facility with seven or more residents.
B. Adult Regulated Uses.
1. Purpose.
a) In the development and execution of this ordinance, it is
recognized that there are some uses, commonly known as adult
uses or sexually oriented businesses, which, because of their
very nature, have serious objectionable operational
characteristics. The impacts of these objectionable
characteristics are exacerbated when several adult uses are
concentrated under certain circumstances or when one or more
of them are located in near proximity to a residential use or
zone, religious assembly, school, park, playground or public
recreational area, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the
adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to
prevent these adverse effects and to ensure that these adverse
effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhood. The controls contained within this
ordinance are for the purpose of preventing the negative
secondary effects associated with adult uses and to prevent a
concentration of these uses within any one area, or to prevent
deterioration or blighting of a nearby residential neighborhood.
b) It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The
provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect
of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including
173. Editor's Note: The Use Table is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 4.1 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-1
sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor
effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment,
or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it
the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize
the distribution of obscene material.
2. Findings.
a) This Ordinance is based on evidence of the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses that are within the common knowledge of
municipalities and is widely reported in judicial opinions, media
reports, land use studies, and crime impact reports made
available to the City Commission, several of which are set forth
in this Ordinance. Additionally, the City Commission relies on
repeated judicial findings of municipalities' reasonable reliance
on this body of secondary effects evidence to support time,
place, and manner regulations of sexually oriented businesses.
The City Commission relies upon and incorporates the findings
of secondary effects discussed in the following nonexhaustive
list of cases from the U.S. Supreme Court: Pap's A.M. v City of
Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Los Angeles v Alameda Books,
Inc., 122 S. Ct 1728 (2002); City of Renton v Playtime Theatres,
Inc. 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v American Mini Theatres, 426
U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); FW/PBS, Inc. v City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990);
California v LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972).
b) The City Commission also relies on relevant decisions of federal
appellate and trial courts: DLS, Inc. v City of Chattanooga, 107 F
3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Currence v City of Cincinnati, 2002 U.S.
App. LEXIS 1258; Broadway Books v Roberts, 642 F. Supp. 486
(E.D. Tenn. 1986); Bright Lights, Inc. v City of Newport, 830 F.
Supp. 378 (E.D. Ky. 1993); Richland Bookmart v Nichols, 137 F
3d 435 (6th Cir. 1998); DejaVu v Metro Government, 1999 U.S.
App. LEXIS 535 (6th Cir. 1999); Bamon Corp. v City of Dayton,
7923 F 2d 470 (6th Cir. 1991); Triplett Grille, Inc. v City of Akron,
40 F 3d 129 (6th Cir. 1994); O'Connor v City and County of
Denver, 894 F 2d 1210 (10th Cir. 1990); DejaVu of Nashville,
Inc., et al v Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson
County, 274 F 3d 377 (6th Cir. 20901); ZJ. Gifts D-2, LLC v City of
Aurora, 136 F 3d 683 (10th Cir. 1998); ILQ Investments, Inc. v
City of Rochester, 225 F 3d 1413 (Eighth Cir. 1994); World Wide
Video of Spokane, Inc. v City of Spokane, 227 F 3d 1143 (E.D.
Wash. 2002); Threesome Entertainment v Strittmother, 4 F.
Supp. 2d 710 (N.D. Ohio 1998); Kentucky Restaurant Concepts,
Inc v City of Louisville and Jefferson County, 209 F. Supp. 2d 672
(W.D. Ky. 2002).
§ 4.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 4.2
46:4-2
c) Additionally, the City Commission expressly relies upon
Michigan cases relating to adult businesses, municipal
regulatory authority, and public nuisances including, but not
limited to, the following cases: Rental Property Owners
Association of Kent County v City of Grand Rapids, 455 Mich
246, 566 NW2d 514 (1996); Michigan ex rel Wayne County
Prosecutor v Dizzy Duck, 449 Mich 353, 535 NW2d 178 (1995);
City of Warren v Executive Art Studio, 1998 Mich App LEXIS
2258 (1998); Tally v City of Detroit, 54 Mich App 328 (1974);
Jatt, Inc v Clinton Township, 224 Mich App 513 (1997).
d) The City Commission notes that media reports document the
harms associated with adult businesses as well: See, e.g.,
Muskegon Man Convicted in Beating Death of Adult Bookstore
Manager, Associated Press State & Local Wire, Sept. 9, 1999;
Katie Merx, X-Rated Inkster Theater Razed: Officials, Cops,
Residents Cheer Demolition of Melody, An Embarrassment for
22 Years, The Detroit News, August 19, 1999, at D3 (discussing
documented sexual activity in and around adult business);
Craig Garrett, Suburbs Declare War on Smut Shops, The Detroit
News, June 30, 1999, at A1 (describing how adult theater
patrons would solicit young people in the area for sex); Justin
Hyde, Warren Leaders Want to Pursue Product Liability Against
Porn Shop, Associated Press State & Local Wire, Feb. 4, 1999
(child rapist arrested in peep show establishment).
e) The City Commission further relies on reports concerning
secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented
businesses, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona —
1984; Minneapolis, Minnesota-1980; Houston, Texas — 1997;
Indianapolis, Indiana — 1984; Amarillo, Texas — 1977; Garden
Grove, California — 1991; Los Angeles, California — 1977;
Whittier, California — 1978; Austin, Texas — 1986; Seattle,
Washington — 1989; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma — 1986;
Cleveland, Ohio — 1977; Dallas, Texas — 1997; McCleary
Report, Alliance, Ohio — 2002; Tucson, Arizona — 1990;
Testimony, Warner-Robins, Georgia — 2000; St. Croix County,
Wisconsin — 1993; Bellevue, Washington — 1998; Newport
News, Virginia — 1996; St. Cloud, Minnesota — 1994;; New York
Times Square Study — 1994; Phoenix, Arizona — 1995-1998;
and also on findings of physical abuse from the paper entitled
"Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual
Violence" by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and
Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis,
Minnesota, and from "Sexually Oriented Businesses: An
Insider's View" by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan
House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan.
12,2000, and the Report of the Attorney General's Working
Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June
6, 1989, State of Minnesota). Based on the cases and reports
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-3
documenting the adverse impact of adult businesses, the City
Commission finds:
1) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial
uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse
secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal
and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and
drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values,
urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and
exploitation.
2) Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex,
occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses,
especially those that provide private or semi-private
booths, rooms, or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sexually explicit shows.
3) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects
constitutes a harm that the City has a substantial
governmental interest in preventing and/or abating.
3. Applicability. The following adult regulated uses are subject to these
controls:
a) Adult arcade or mini-motion-picture theaters;

from the lot occupied by the adult regulated use to the nearest
point of the lot occupied by any of the uses so listed in
Subsection 4.a.(1) through (6).
c) For purposes of Subsections 4.a.(7) and (8), the distance
limitations shall be measured in a straight line without regard to
intervening structures or objects from the property line of the
lot occupied by the adult regulated use to the nearest point of
the property line occupied by the public park or other
recreational areas so listed in Subsection 4.a(7) or the zoning
district boundary of the residential district as provided in
Subsection 4.a(8).
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-5
d) No building, premises, structure, or other facility that contains
any adult regulated use shall contain any other kind of adult
regulated use. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant
permission for more than one adult regulated use to operate in
a single building, provided that an equal or greater number of
adult regulated uses are removed from elsewhere in the City.
The location where an adult regulated use is removed pursuant
to this section shall not be reused for any adult regulated use in

motorists on any street, sidewalk, or public right-of-way, or from
an adjacent land use.
k) The adult regulated use shall satisfy all requirements for a full
site plan and all landscaping requirements of the City Zoning
Ordinance. The adult regulated use shall also demonstrate that
the site meets all of the traffic and access management
standards of the City of Kalamazoo. The site plan shall include a
diagram that shows all land use zoning districts and any of the

to be licensed by the State of Michigan or the City of Kalamazoo shall
have a valid license at all times, and it shall be a violation of this Code to
operate at any time without a valid license.
D. Attached Dwelling.
1. General. An attached house is a dwelling unit, located on its own lot
that shares one or more common or abutting walls with one or more
dwelling units. The common or abutting wall must be shared for at
least 50% of the length of the side of the dwelling units. An attached
house does not share common floor/ceilings with other dwelling
units. An attached house is also called a rowhouse. Attached houses
must comply with the Density, Intensity and Dimensional standards
of § 5.1: Residential District Standards, except where such standards
are expressly modified by the provisions of this section.
2. Standards that Apply in the RD Districts. The following standards
apply to attached housing in the RD districts:
a) No more than two units may be attached by a common wall.
Structures containing three or more attached dwelling units are
prohibited in the district.
b) Each attached house must be on a lot that complies with the lot
area and width standards for new lots in the underlying RD
district.
c) The minimum required interior side setback on the side of the
dwelling unit containing the common wall is reduced to zero.
The (interior) side and rear setback standards of the underlying
district apply around the perimeter of the project.
d) On corner lots, either the rear setback or interior side setback
may be reduced to zero. However, the remaining interior side or
rear setback must comply with the rear setback standards of
the underlying RD district.
§ 4.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 4.2
46:4-8
Figure 4-1: Corner Lots
e) Garage door areas may not comprise more than 40% of the
width of the street-facing facade of the structure containing the
attached housing units. The maximum continuous,
uninterrupted length of a garage door (or combination of
smaller, one-car garage doors) along the street-facing facade
may not exceed 25 feet in width. All garage doors must be
recessed at least five feet from the front building plane. The
intent of these standards is to prevent garages and blank walls
from being the dominant visual feature on the front of the
structure.
f) Facades and roofs must be designed in a manner that provides
distinguishing characteristics and relief between attached
dwelling units. Such variety may consist of occasional relief in
facade depth from unit to unit, unique articulations in
architectural elements such as windows, entries and decorative
facade building materials, and variations in roof design such as
cornice articulation and roof pitch/direction. [Added
3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-9
g) Attached dwelling units in the RD districts shall be oriented
toward, and be directly accessible from, the public way or street
on which the building fronts. [Added 3-19-2007 by Ord. No.
1822]
3. Standards that Apply in the RM-15, RM-24, RM-36, and RMU
Districts. The following standards apply to attached housing in the
RM districts:
a) Up to eight dwelling units may be attached (have common
walls) in the RM-15 district. There is no limit on the number of
attached units in the RM-24, RM-36, and RMU districts. Attached
dwelling units in all RM districts must be oriented toward, and
be directly accessible from, the public way or street on which
the building fronts.
b) The minimum lot area and width standards do not apply to
attached houses in the RM districts. The minimum lot area for
an attached house in the RM district is 3,000 square feet or the
minimum lot area per dwelling unit of the underlying district,
whichever is greater.
c) The minimum interior side setback on the side containing a
common wall is reduced to zero. The (interior) side and rear
setback standards of the underlying district apply around the

may be reduced to zero. However, the remaining interior side or
rear setback must comply with the rear setback standards of
the underlying district.
e) Facades and roofs must be designed in a manner that provides
distinguishing characteristics and relief between attached
dwelling units. Such variety may consist of occasional relief in
facade depth from unit to unit, unique articulation in
architectural elements such as windows, entries and decorative
facade building materials, and variations in roof design such as
cornice articulation and roof pitch/direction.
f) A common access to the rear of the lots for common or

doors or windows) must be comprised of natural brick, stone,
wood siding, or other natural materials (excluding plywood or
concrete block).
b) The roof line of each dwelling unit must be distinct through
either a separation of roof pitches (minimum difference of at
least 5°), a difference in roof direction, a difference in roof
height (minimum of two vertical feet), or a combination of
methods.
c) The front facade of each attached unit must be distinct through
either the use of different facade materials, staggered building
lines (minimum of two feet), an identifiable permanent
architectural design element such as a chimney, pilaster or
column (excluding gutter spouts or siding trim), or a
combination of methods.
d) Garage door areas may not comprise more than 40% of the
width of the street-facing facade of the structure containing the
attached housing units. The maximum continuous,
uninterrupted length of a garage door (or combination of
smaller, one-car garage doors) along the street-facing facade
may not exceed 25 feet in width. A minimum separation of six
feet is required between such expanses of garage doors. All
garage doors must be recessed at least five feet from the front
building plane. The intent of these standards is to prevent
garages and blank walls from being the dominant visual feature
on the front of the structure.

density allowed by the underlying district or the maximum density
that could be achieved through a conventional subdivision (where
all lots comply with minimum lot area and width standards). The City
Planner is authorized to require that the developer prepare a density
yield analysis comparing the number of dwelling units that could be
developed under a conventional subdivision with the number that
could be prepared under a cluster housing development.
4. Lot Size. There is no minimum lot size (area or width) requirement
for cluster housing developments. Lot sizes must be adequate to
meet all applicable standards of this Ordinance.
5. Housing Types.
a) Attached and detached houses are the only type of housing
allowed in a cluster housing development. The proposed
building envelope for all houses must be shown on the site plan
with enough detail so that compliance with required density and
dimensional standards can be determined.
b) The number of attached houses that may be attached by a
common wall is limited as follows:

cluster housing development that is adjacent to any street or
right-of-way.
b) A setback equal to the minimum rear setback of the underlying
district must be provided along the entire perimeter of the
cluster housing development that is adjacent to any street or
right-of-way.
c) Within the development, the distance between detached
houses must be at least 10 feet.
d) These required front and side yard setbacks may not be
counted as open space for the purpose of meeting the minimum
open space standards for cluster housing developments.

underlying district do not apply to each individual lot, but the total
building coverage of all lots (in aggregate) may not exceed the
maximum building coverage standard of the underlying district.
8. Designated Open Space.
a) At least 50% of the gross land area within a cluster housing
development must be preserved as open space.
b) Open space may include active or passive recreation areas for
residents or conservation areas for natural resources such as
wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, and woodlands.
c) All of the required open space must be set aside through
conveyance or other means as is approved as to form by the
City Attorney, such as:
1) Recorded deed restrictions.
2) Covenants that run perpetually with the land.
3) A conservation easement.
4) Land trusts.
d) Such conveyance or other means must assure that the
designated open space will be protected from all forms of
development, except as shown on the approved site plan, and
may not be changed to another use without express, prior
approval by the decision-making body that approved it. Such
conveyance or other means must also:
1) Indicate the proposed allowable use of the designated open
space.
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-15
2) Require that the designated open space be maintained by
parties who have an ownership interest in the designated
open space.
3) Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the
designated open space.

W. Telecommunications Facilities.
1. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to regulate the
placement, construction, and modification of transmission towers
and telecommunications facilities in order to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time not
unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless telecommunications marketplace in Kalamazoo. The
specific purposes are as follows:
a) To regulate the location of transmission towers and
telecommunications facilities in the City;
b) To protect residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impact of transmission towers and telecommunications
facilities;
c) To minimize adverse visual impact of transmission towers and
telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting,
landscaping, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
d) To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of
transmission towers and antenna support structures as a
primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
transmission towers;
e) To avoid potential damage to property caused by transmission
towers and telecommunications facilities by ensuring such
structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed,
modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or
determined to be structurally unsound; and
f) To ensure that transmission towers and telecommunications
facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses.
g) Nothing in this section applies to amateur radio antennas, or
facilities, used exclusively for the transmission of television or
radio signals.
2. Siting; Permitted and Special Uses. No telecommunication facility or
transmission tower may be constructed, modified to increase its
height, installed or otherwise located within the City except as
provided in this section. Depending on the type and location of the
telecommunication facility, the telecommunication facility will be
either a permitted use, subject to building review procedures, or a
special use.
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-27
a) No special use permit is required for a telecommunication
facility or transmission tower that is allowed as a permitted use
pursuant to § 4.2W.3: Collocation on Existing Towers, § 4.2W.4:
Collocation on Other Structures, and § 4.2W.5: Construction of
New Transmission Towers. Such telecommunication facilities will
require site plan review and any permits required by the
Kalamazoo City Code.
b) A telecommunication facility or transmission tower that,
pursuant to § 4.2W.3: Collocation on Existing Towers, § 4.2W.4:
Collocation on Other Structures, and § 4.2W.5: Construction of

be processed in accordance with § 8.3D: Special Use Permit and
in accordance with established administrative policies,
including review by appropriate City of Kalamazoo advisory
boards. No permits may be issued prior to completion of the
special use permit and site plan process, including any appeals.
3. Collocation on Existing Towers.
a) Collocation of an additional antenna on an existing transmission
tower will be considered a permitted use in any M-1, M-2, CCBD,
CC, CO, CBTR, CN-1, CN-2, CMU, P or IC district, or if the
transmission tower is in any other zoning district, and the City
specifically approved, as part of a special use permit process
authorizing the transmission tower, collocation of additional
antennas.
b) Collocation of an additional antenna on an existing transmission
tower requires a special use permit in any RS, RD, RM, RMU,
RMHP or CNO district if approval for collocation was not granted
through a prior special use permit process.
4. Collocation on Other Structures.
a) In addition to collocation on an existing transmission tower, an
antenna may be collocated on existing buildings, light poles,
utility poles, and water towers.
b) Such collocation on a building, light pole, utility pole, or water
tower, will be considered a permitted use provided that the
antennas and ancillary facilities comply with all applicable
building codes, the color of the antennas blends in with the
existing structure and surroundings, the antennas do not
exceed the height limitation of the zoning district, and the
property is located in any M-1, M-2, CCBD, CC, CO, CBTR, CN-1,
CN-2, CNU, P or IC district.
c) Such collocation on a building, light pole, utility pole, or water
tower requires a special use permit in any RS, RD, RM, RMU,
RMHP, or CNO district. Said antenna(s) may not exceed the
building height allowed in the district, or 18 feet above the
§ 4.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 4.2
46:4-28
structure, whichever is less. Said antenna(s) may project no
more than two feet away from the existing structure, and the
color of the antenna(s) must blend in with the existing structure
and surroundings.
5. Construction of New Transmission Towers. Construction of a
transmission tower or a modification of an existing transmission
tower to increase its height will be allowed as follows:
a) Such construction or modification is considered a permitted use
in M-1 and M-2.
b) Such construction requires a special use permit in any CCBD, CC
CO, CN-1, CN-2, CMU, P or IC district. Such construction also
requires a special use permit in any RS, RD, RM, RMHP, CNO or
IC district, but only in the following locations:
1) Religious assembly, but only when designed as a steeple,
bell tower, or similar accessory structure compatible with
the principal use on the property.
2) Parks.
3) Government, public utility, or public school sites.
c) Such construction shall be prohibited in the CBTR district.
d) Any new transmission tower must be built, constructed, or
erected with the capability of supporting a minimum of two
other telecommunication facilities, comparable in weight, size,
and surface area to the applicant's facilities, pursuant to
§ 4.2W.7.c: Standards for Transmission Towers and Antennas.
6. Application Requirements. Application requirements shall be set
forth by the City Planner and may be modified from time to time as
necessary. If a special use permit is required, the application
requirements shall also include all materials required for a special
use permit pursuant to § 8.3D: Special Use Permit.
7. Standards for Transmission Towers and Antennas. Installation,
construction or modification of all transmission towers and antennas
must comply with the following standards, unless a waiver is
obtained pursuant to the provisions of § 4.2W.9: Waiver.
a) No transmission tower may be constructed within one-mile of
any existing transmission tower. Tower separation must be
measured by following a straight line from the portion of the
base of the proposed transmission tower that is closest to the
base of any preexisting transmission tower. For purposes of this
paragraph, an existing tower includes any transmission tower
for which the City has issued a building permit, or for which an
application has been filed and not denied. Transmission towers
constructed or approved prior to August 1, 1997, may be
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-29
modified to accommodate additional providers consistent with
provisions for collocation in this section.
b) Transmission tower and antenna heights are governed by this
section except as provided for below:
1) If located within any M-1 or M-2 district, the height
limitation for that zoning district applies.
2) If located within any CC, CO, CN-1, CN-2, CMU, P or IC
district, the maximum height of a transmission tower,
including antennas, is 100 feet, unless a waiver is granted
pursuant to the provisions of § 4.2W.9: Waiver.
3) If located within any RS, RD, RM, RMHP, RMU, CNO or IC
district, the maximum height of a transmission tower,
including antennas, is 75 feet, unless a waiver is granted
pursuant to the provisions of § 4.2W.9: Waiver.
c) New transmission towers must be designed to accommodate
collocation of additional providers:
1) New transmission towers of a height of 100 feet or more
must be designed to accommodate collocation of a
minimum of two additional providers either outright or
through future modification to the transmission tower.
2) New transmission towers of a height of at least 60 feet and
no more than 100 feet must be designed to accommodate
collocation of a minimum of one additional provider either
outright or through future modification to the transmission
tower.
d) The following setbacks from adjacent property lines and
adjacent streets are required unless a waiver is granted
pursuant to the provisions of § 4.2W.9: Waiver:
1) If located within any RS, RD, RM, RMHP, RMU, CNO or IC
district, the transmission tower must be set back from
adjacent property lines a minimum number of feet that is
equal to the height of the transmission tower.
2) If the transmission tower is located on a parcel in any
nonresidential zoning district that abuts residentially zoned
property, the transmission tower must be set back from the
adjacent residentially zoned property line a minimum
number of feet that is equal to the height of the
transmission tower.
3) In any RS, RD, RM, RMHP, RMU, CNO or IC district,
transmission towers must be set back from adjacent public
streets a minimum number of feet that is equal to the
height of the transmission tower. In all other zoning
§ 4.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 4.2
46:4-30
districts, the setback from adjacent public streets must be
a minimum of 25 feet.
e) In all zoning districts, existing vegetation must be preserved to
the maximum extent possible. In all zoning districts,
landscaping must be placed completely around the
transmission tower and ancillary facilities located at ground
level except as required to access the facility. Such landscaping
must consist of evergreen vegetation with a minimum planted
height of six feet placed densely so as to form a screen.
Landscaping must be compatible with other nearby landscaping
and must be kept healthy and well maintained. Landscaping
must be installed on the outside of any fencing.
f) In any CN-1, CN-2, RS, RD, RM, RMHP, RMU, or CNO district and
in all other zoning districts when the adjacent property is zoned
residentially or occupied by a dwelling, hospital, school, library,
or nursing home, noise generating equipment must be soundbuffered
by means of baffling, barriers, or other suitable means
to reduce sound level measured at the property line to 45 dBa.
In all other locations, noise must be regulated by applicable City
ordinances.
g) Transmission towers may not be artificially lighted except as
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In cases
where there are residential uses located within a distance that
is 300% of the height of the transmission tower from the
transmission tower, and when required by federal law, dual
mode lighting must be requested from the FAA.
h) The transmission tower and attached antennas must be
unpainted galvanized steel or painted neutral colors or such
shades as are appropriate and compatible with the surrounding
environment, as approved by the City.
i) No signs, striping, graphics or other attention getting devices
are permitted on the transmission tower or ancillary facilities
except for warning and safety signage with a surface area of no
more than three square feet. Such signage must be affixed to a
fence or ancillary facility and the number of signs is limited to
no more than two.
8. Standards for Ancillary Facilities to a Transmission Tower. All
ancillary facilities must comply with the standards of Subsections (e)
and (f) of § 4.2W.7: Standards for Transmission Towers and
Antennas. In addition, all ancillary facilities within any RS, RD, RM,
CNO or IC district must be located underground to the maximum
extent technology allows, unless a waiver is obtained pursuant to
the provisions of § 4.2W.9: Waiver. This underground restriction does
not apply within other zoning districts.
9. Waiver.
§ 4.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.2
46:4-31
a) Any waiver to the requirements of this section may be granted
only pursuant to the following provisions. The criteria for
granting a waiver are as set forth in this section only, and may
not include the criteria in § 8.3D: Special Use Permit.
b) The City may grant a waiver from the provisions of § 4.2W.7:
Standards for Transmission Towers and Antennas, provided the
applicant demonstrates that:
1) It is technologically impossible to locate the proposed
transmission tower on available sites more than one-mile
from a preexisting transmission tower and still provide the
approximate coverage the transmission tower is intended
to provide;
2) The preexisting transmission tower that is within one mile
of the proposed transmission tower cannot be modified to
accommodate another provider; and
3) There are no available buildings, light or utility poles, or
water towers on which antennas may be located and still
provide the approximate coverage the transmission tower
is intended to provide.
4) The City may grant a waiver to the setback and
undergrounding requirements of Subsection (d) of § 4.2W.7:
Standards for Transmission Towers and Antennas or
§ 4.2.W8: Standards for Ancillary Facilities to a Transmission
Tower, upon finding that stealth design, proposed
landscaping, configuration of the site, or the presence of
mature trees obviates the need for compliance.
5) The City may grant a waiver to the one-hundred-foot height
limitation in any CC, CO, CN-2, CN-1, or CMU district, or to
the seventy-five-foot height limitation in any RS, RD, RM,
RMU, CNO, or IC district if the applicant shows, through
written documentation provided by an engineer, that the
proposed height is the minimum height needed to meet
service needs and to accommodate future collocations per
Subsection (c) of § 4.2W.7: Standards for Transmission
Towers and Antennas.
6) If the proposed transmission tower, ancillary facility or
other telecommunication facilities require a special use
permit, the request for waiver must be considered as part
of the special use permit process. If the proposed
transmission tower, ancillary facility or other
telecommunication facilities are a permitted use, the
request for a waiver must be decided by the City Planner
and must be based on the criteria in this section.
10. Removal of Facilities.
§ 4.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 4.2
46:4-32
a) All transmission towers, antennas, transmission tower
substructures and ancillary facilities must be removed within six
months of the time that the facilities have ceased being used to
transmit, receive or relay voice and data signals to or from
wireless communication devices. The owner and operator of the
tower, antenna, substructure or facility and the real property
owner upon which the tower, antenna, substructure or facility is
located are responsible for removing such facilities. The site
must be restored with appropriate landscaping to its pretransmission
tower appearance. The City Planner may grant
one six-month extension where a written request has been filed,
within the initial six month period, to reuse the transmission
tower or antennas.
b) The City may require the posting of an open-ended bond or
accept some other performance guarantee suitable to the City
before building permit issuance to insure removal of the
transmission tower, substructure or antennas after the facility
no longer is being used.
11. Fees. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the City
Planner may require, as part of application fees for building or
special use permits for telecommunication facilities, an amount
sufficient to recover all of the City's costs in retaining consultants to
verify statements made in conjunction with the permit application,
to the extent that verification requires telecommunications
expertise. This amount of this fee shall be set by City Commission
resolution.
X. Transitional Residence. In the CN-2, CC, and CCBD districts, transitional
residences must be located at least 1,500 feet from any other
transitional residence, adult foster-care group home, and any other adult

A. Purpose. This section regulates uses and structures that are incidental to
principal uses and buildings to prevent them from becoming the
predominant element of the site. The standards provide for necessary
access around structures, help maintain privacy to abutting lots, and
maintain open front setbacks.
B. General Standards.
1. Subordinate to Principal Use. Accessory uses and structures must be
subordinate to the principal use and structure on the subject lot in
terms of area, extent and purpose.
2. Time of Establishment and Removal. Accessory structures must be
constructed in conjunction with or after the principal building. They
may not be built prior to the construction of the principal structure.
No accessory use or structure may continue in use or operation after
the principal primary structure or principal to which it is accessory
§ 4.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 4.3
46:4-40
has been removed or ceased operation, unless the accessory use is
also listed as a permitted use in the zone district.
3. Compliance with District Standards. Unless otherwise expressly
stated, the setback, height, and building coverage standards of the
underlying district apply to both principal and accessory structures.
C. Building Coverage.
1. The combined footprint of all detached covered accessory buildings
may not exceed 20% of the total area of the lot, unless a larger lot
coverage is specifically permitted by another provision of this
Ordinance.
2. A detached accessory building may not have a larger building
footprint than the building footprint of the principal structure.
D. Location in Required Setbacks.
1. Accessory structures not more than 16 feet in height may be located
in required rear setbacks if they do not occupy more than 33% of the
actual rear yard area and are located at least three feet from any lot
line. Preexisting, detached, conforming accessory structures located
in rear yards shall not become nonconforming if the primary
structure on the site is expanded causing any portion of the
accessory structure to be in the side yard. [Amended 3-19-2007
by Ord. No. 1822]
2. Trellises that provide entry into a property may be located in
required front yard setbacks if they are no more than eight feet tall,
eight feet wide, and eight feet deep, are not located in the public
right-of-way, do not obscure or block vehicular traffic lines of sight,
do not impede or block pedestrian circulation, and do not hinder
access to the property by emergency services and equipment. One
such trellis is allowed per pedestrian entrance into a property. When
required by the Building Official, a building permit shall be obtained
prior to the erection of a trellis. [Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No.
1822]
3. Mechanical structures, such as heat pumps, air conditioners,
emergency generators, and water pumps are not allowed in
required front setbacks, but may be located in rear or side setbacks
if located at least three feet from rear and side lot lines.
4. No ornamental or other lawn feature, including but not limited to
statues, figurines, decorations, art objects, animal shelters,
containers, or other similar items, over 2 1/2 feet in height shall be
installed or maintained within 25 feet of any public street, or within
any triangular area defined by the following three types of points:

§ 4.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.3
46:4-41
a) Point 1: The point of intersection of intersection of any public
street with (i) any other public street, or (ii) any railroad right-ofway
with an at-grade crossing, or (iii) any private driveway
(other than a driveway for a single- or two-family residential
structure);
b) Point 2: A point along the side right-of-way line of the first public
street located 25 feet away from the point of intersection; and
c) Point 3: A point along the side line of second public street, or the
railroad right-of-way, or the private driveway, located 25 feet
away from the point of intersection.
E. Height of Accessory Buildings. Unless otherwise expressly stated, no
accessory building in a residential district may exceed 16 feet in height.
In a nonresidential district, no accessory building may exceed the height
of the principal building on the same lot.
F. Setbacks. Unless otherwise expressly stated, accessory structures may
not be located in the front yard. Detached garages and carports can be
located in front yards but not in required front yard setbacks.
G. Home Occupations.
1. General. Some types of work can be conducted at home with little or
no effect on the surrounding neighborhood. The home occupation
regulations of this subsection are intended to permit residents to
engage in customary home occupations, while ensuring that such
home occupations will not be a detriment to the character and
livability of the surrounding area. The regulations require that home
occupations (an accessory use) remain subordinate to the allowed
principal use (residential) and that the residential viability of the
dwelling unit is maintained.
2. Allowed uses. The home occupation regulations of this subsection
establish performance standards rather than detailed lists of
allowed home occupations. Except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, businesses located in a residential dwelling that comply
with all of the standards of this subsection will be allowed as home
occupations unless they are specifically prohibited. The home
occupation must be clearly subordinate and incidental to the use of
the dwelling as a residence. [Amended 9-20-2010 by Ord. No.
1873]
3. Where Allowed. Home occupations that comply with the regulations
of this section will be allowed as an accessory use to any allowed
residential use.
4. Size. A home occupation may not occupy more than 25% of the floor
area of the principal dwelling unit.
5. Prohibited Uses.

washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators) or any other work
related to motor vehicles and their parts is prohibited as a home
occupation.
b) Dispatch Centers. Dispatch centers, where employees come to
the site to be dispatched to other locations, are not allowed as
home occupations.
c) Animal Boarding Facilities. Animal boarding facilities are not
allowed as home occupations. This includes kennels,
commercial stables and all other types of animal boarding
facilities.
d) Restaurants. All types of restaurants are prohibited as home
occupations.
e) Firearms. All uses involving the distribution of firearms or the
storage of firearms intended for sale or distribution are
prohibited as home occupations.
f) Barber and Beauty Shops. All types of barber and beauty shops

full-time resident of the subject dwelling unit and be on the premises
during the hours of operation of the home occupation.
7. Employees. A maximum of one nonresident employee may be on
the premises at any one time. For the purpose of this provision, the
term "nonresident employee" includes an employee, business
partner, co-owner, or other person affiliated with the home
occupation, who does not live at the site, but who visits the site as
part of the home occupation.
8. Signs. No more than one nameplate sign with a maximum size of
one square foot is allowed. Such sign must be attached to the
building and may not be illuminated.
9. Location. All work areas and activities associated with home
occupations must be conducted and located inside the principal
dwelling unit, and not on the ground floor in accessory buildings or
garages, whether attached or detached.
10. Exterior Appearance. There may be no visible evidence of the
conduct of a home occupation (other than an allowed sign) when
viewed from the street right-of-way or from an adjacent lot. There
may be no change in the exterior appearance of the dwelling unit
§ 4.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 4.3
46:4-43
that houses a home occupation or the site upon which it is
conducted that will make the dwelling appear less residential in
nature or function. Examples of such prohibited alterations include
construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding
commercial-like exterior lighting.
11. Operational Impacts. No home occupation or equipment used in
conjunction with a home occupation may cause odor, vibration,
noise, electrical interference or fluctuation in voltage that is
perceptible beyond the lot line of the lot upon which the home
occupation is conducted. No hazardous substances may be used or
stored in conjunction with a home occupation.
12. Retail Sales and Display. No stock in-trade may be stored or sold
upon the premises, other than those produced on the premises.

block outside visibility of the plants from public view, with no
plants visibly growing above the fence or barrier, and the fence
or barrier is locked or otherwise secured to limit access only to
the primary caregiver or qualifying patient engaged in
cultivating the plants;

permits shall be obtained for any portion of the residential
structure in which electrical wiring, lighting, and/or watering
devices are located, installed or modified that support the

location, any lighting methods that exceed usual residential use
between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. shall employ
shielding methods, without alteration to the exterior of the
residence, to prevent ambient light spillage that causes or

E. Height.
1. Measurement. Building height is measured as the vertical distance
from grade at the base of the structure to:
a) The highest point of the coping of a flat roof,
b) The deck line of a mansard roof, or
c) The mean height between the eaves and ridge on gable, hip or
gambrel roofs.
2. Exceptions.
a) Except as specifically provided in this Ordinance, the height
limits of this Ordinance do not apply to any roof structures for
housing elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, solar
energy collectors, or similar equipment required to operate and
maintain a building, provided that such structures do not cover
more than 33% of the roof area or extend over 10 feet in height
above the maximum height allowed by the underlying district.

F. Impervious Cover. Impervious surface is any hard surfaced, humanmade
area that does not readily absorb or retain water, including but not
limited to building roofs, parking and driveway areas, graveled areas,
sidewalks and paved recreation areas. In addition, impervious cover
includes swimming pools, because absorbed and retained water is not
permitted to permeate the ground. City approved pervious paving
materials may be excluded from impervious cover calculations.
G. Limitations. The regulations of this chapter 5 shall not be applied so as to
reduce the buildable width or depth of any lot of record to less than 50%
of its average width or depth. These yard and setback regulations shall
not be applied so as to prohibit the reconstruction of a one-family
dwelling, existing on October 18, 2005, that has been damaged or
destroyed and that is reconstructed within two years from the date of
said damage or destruction; provided such reconstruction shall maintain
the same yard and setback dimensions as the original structure.

CHAPTER 6
General Development Standards
All development in all zone districts shall comply with all applicable standards in
this chapter 6, unless specifically exempted in the subsections below, or unless a
different standard is required by an applicable overlay district. These standards shall
apply in addition to:
A. Those district-specific standards listed in Chapters 2 and 3 (for the zone
district(s) where the property is located); and
B. Those use-specific standards listed in Chapter 4 (as applicable to the proposed
use); and
C. Those density/intensity/dimensional standards in Chapter 5.
In the event of any conflict between the standards set forth in this chapter 6 and the
standards set forth in Chapters 2 through 5, the latter shall govern.
§ 6.1. (Reserved)176
§ 6.2. Landscaping and Open Spaces.
A. Intent. The intent of § 6.2 is to specify landscape requirements for all
land uses requiring site plan review, and to provide for landscape
techniques to achieve compatibility between abutting and adjacent
uses, including public and private streets. These regulations are
designed to have flexibility taking into account the high percentage of
already developed property and the wide variation in the size of existing
lots. In addition, these regulations are intended to:
1. Promote the public health, safety and general welfare by reducing
noise, air and visual pollution, air temperature, and light glare;
2. Improve air quality;
3. Prevent soil erosion and increase water retention;
4. Improve the appearance of on-premises parking, vehicular-use
areas, and property abutting public rights-of-way;
5. Improve the aesthetics and safety of pedestrian sidewalks, both
within paved areas and along public rights-of-way;
6. Require buffering between different land uses;
7. Protect residential privacy; and
8. Encourage the use of landscape vegetation native to Southwest
Michigan.
176. Editor's Note: Former 6.1, Off-Street Parking and Loading, as amended, was repealed
11-19-2018 by Ord. No. 1973. For current parking and loading regulations, see Chapter
50, Zoning, Art. 7, Parking and Loading Regulations.
§ 6.1 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.2
46:6-1
B. Applicability. All uses requiring a sketch site plan or full site plan
pursuant to § 8.3H: Site Plan shall comply with the requirements
contained in § 6.2.
C. General Landscaping Standards.
1. Landscape Plan Required. A landscaping plan shall be required to be
submitted as a part of all development applications subject to § 6.2,
unless the City Planner determines that compliance with the
provisions of § 6.2 can be documented without the use of such a
plan. Each landscaping plan shall comply with all provisions of § 6.2.
A landscaping plan may be combined with other required
application materials if compliance with § 6.2 can be clearly
demonstrated in the combined materials.
2. Maximum Percentage of One Species. Except for plantings used for
screening, no one species of tree or shrub may make up more than
50% of the total amount of landscape plantings.
3. Plant Materials. All plant material shall be hardy to the area, free of
disease and insects, and conform to the American Standard for
Nursery Stock of the American Association of Nurserymen. The use
of vegetation native to the area and Southwest Michigan, the use of
a mixture of vegetation from the same species association, and the
adherence to standards as recommended in the document entitled
Recommended Landscaping Standards in the City of Kalamazoo, is
encouraged.
4. Minimum Living Materials. In all areas where landscaping is
required, a minimum of 50% of the surface area shall be covered by
living materials, rather than bark, gravel, or other nonliving
materials.
5. Minimum Sizes. The minimum size of plant materials shall be as
shown in the graphics of the Recommended Landscaping Standards
in the City of Kalamazoo, copies of which shall be made available in
the office of the Community Planning and Development
Department.
6. Plant Material Spacing. Except for buffer zone provisions of § 6.2H:
Buffer Area Landscaping Between Land Uses, plant materials shall
not be placed closer than four feet from the fence line or property
line. Plant materials used together in informal groupings shall meet
the on-center spacing requirements as shown in the Recommended
Landscaping Standards in the City of Kalamazoo.
7. City Right-of-Way. Tree removal or planting in City rights-of-way shall
be in accordance with Chapter 42 of the Code of Ordinances of
Kalamazoo. Unless an alternate surface is approved by the Public
Services Department or other appropriate jurisdiction, all public
rights-of-way located between street edges and property lines shall
be grass-surfaced. [Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
§ 6.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.2
46:6-2
8. Naturalized Landscaping. Naturalized landscaping is permitted in
accordance with §§ 22-3, 22-4, and 22-5 of the Code of Ordinances
of Kalamazoo.
9. Delay of Installation Due to Season. Whenever the installation of
required landscaping is not possible by the time construction on the
primary structure has been completed, staff may authorize a delay
in installation until no later than the following June 30. As a condition
of authorizing a delay in installation, the City may require that a
letter of credit or other guarantee of such installation be provided by
the applicant, or the City may issue a temporary certificate of
occupancy, with the permanent certificate of occupancy to be
issued following installation of all required landscaping.
10. Preservation of Existing Screening. Regardless of the other
provisions under this subsection, existing trees, vegetation, other
natural features, and other screening components such as walls,
berms, and fences that are located within the required setback of
the site, that are healthy or otherwise in good condition, and that
provide, in the opinion of the City Planner, an important measure of
screening for adjacent properties shall be preserved. When a
property is required to provide buffering/screening under the
regulations in § 6.2, a site plan shall be provided that identifies all
existing trees of 10 inches or greater in diameter measured at
breast height located throughout the entire site and which of those
trees will be removed; any existing healthy trees in good condition
shall only be removed on a showing of good cause. [Added
5-16-2011 by Ord. No. 1882]
D. Sidewalk Required. In all zone districts except Manufacturing districts,
each lot where the principal land use is a nonindustrial use shall include
a sidewalk along the lot frontage. Such sidewalk shall be a minimum of
four feet in width and shall be located so as to align with sidewalks on
adjacent properties, or, if no such sidewalks exist, then shall be located a
minimum of five feet from the curbline in order to allow room for
plantings between the sidewalk and the curbline.
E. Required Landscaping for Front Yard Setbacks Without Parking or Paved
Areas. Required front yard setbacks shall contain a minimum of one tree
or one evergreen tree for each 35 feet of linear street frontage, plus one
shrub for each 25 feet of linear street frontage. Lot frontage areas
occupied by curb cuts or driveways shall be included when calculating
linear frontage planting requirements, and any trees that would
otherwise be required in such areas being planted in remaining lot
frontage areas unless prohibited by minimum spacing requirements for
the species being use.
F. Required Landscaping for Building Perimeters. In all zone districts except
the CCBD zone district, all primary structures in multifamily, commercial,
or industrial use shall include building perimeter landscaping. At least
one shrub shall be planted per each five lineal feet of each facade facing
§ 6.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.2
46:6-3
a public right-of-way or containing a primary entrance. Foundation
plantings may be clustered to provide interest, and plants of larger size
or differing species shall be installed adjacent to the main pedestrian
entryway to each building to emphasize that entryway. Foundation
planting requirements may be waived for portions of the sides or rears of
buildings where loading areas or other similar areas precluding planting.
G. Required Landscaping for Parking Lots and Loading Zones. All parking
lots shall be required to provide the following amounts and types of
landscaping unless alternative standards for specific situations are
required pursuant to § 6.3: Screening and Fences or § 6.5: Design
Standards below:
1. Perimeter Screening From Public Streets.
a) All zone districts except CCBD. In all zone districts except the
CCBD zone, each parking lot that abuts a public street shall
provide a landscape screen as follows:
1) Minimum width: five feet.
2) Required trees: one tree per 35 feet of linear frontage.
3) Required shrubs: three shrubs per 20 feet of linear
frontage. Shrubs shall not be required if a berm or an
opaque fence or wall having a minimum height of three feet
is erected.
b) CCBD Zone District. All parking lots within the CCBD zone
district shall provide a landscape screen as follows:
1) Minimum width: three feet. The Site Plan Review
Committee may reduce or waive the minimum width
requirement if a decorative wall or fence having a minimum
height of three feet is erected.
2) Required trees: one tree per 20 feet of linear feet if the
planting width is a minimum of four feet.
3) Required plantings: six shrubs per 20 feet of linear
frontage.
4) The Site Plan Review Committee may waive in whole or in
part all required plantings in cases where a decorative wall
or fence having a minimum height of three feet is erected,
or when approved screen width does not make planting
possible.
2. Perimeter Screening From Abutting Residential. When a parking lot
or loading area directly adjoins or faces a residentially zoned or
residentially used lot (regardless of whether there is an intervening
street or alley or railway right-of-way), a continuous screening wall,
berm, fence or row of planting having a minimum height of four feet
§ 6.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.2
46:6-4
shall be provided. Such screening material shall be designed to
provide 75% opacity one year after planting for the required height
and length of the screening buffer.
3. Interior Landscaping Requirements. Parking lots in all districts
having more than 30 parking spaces shall be required to provide the
following landscape improvements internal to the parking lot:
a) Five percent of the entire parking lot area shall be provided as a

5. City Planner's Right to Select Landscape or other Screening Options.
For purposes of the landscape or other screening component
options listed under Subsection H(1) through H(4), the City Planner
reserves the right to select which of the three options listed in each
such subsection is appropriate for the proposed project under the
following criteria:
a) The character and type of screening used on adjacent
properties;
b) The adequacy of the existing screening on the project site; and
c) What option provides the most effective screening for the
adjacent property.
6. Additional Screening for Topographic Considerations in all Zones.
When any portion of a principal building on a property abutting any
project that is subject to these regulations is located within 50 feet
of a property line that is shared with the project property, as
measured perpendicularly from the shared property line to and
along the line of the foundation of the principal building, and the
grade elevation of the principal building, as measured at twelve-inch
intervals, averages two or more feet higher than the grade elevation
at the shared property line, the height of the required screening for
the project shall be increased by an amount equal to the grade
difference, up to a maximum total height of 12 feet. In addition, the
location of the required screening for the project may be moved
away from the shared property line if, at the discretion of the City
Planner, such location will provide a greater screening benefit for
the abutting property than if it was located at the property line.
I. Maintenance. Landscaped areas and plant materials required by
ordinance shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Plant materials,
including lawns and naturalized landscaping, shall be maintained in a
healthy growing condition, and be neat and orderly in appearance. If any
plant material required by this chapter dies or becomes diseased, it shall
be replaced by the property owner. The Zoning Inspector is authorized to
cite property owners if plant materials required by this chapter die or
become diseased and are not replaced by the property owner. The
Zoning Inspector shall require that plantings be replaced within 30 days
of written notice or within an extended time period as specified in said
notice.
1. Tree stakes, guy wires and tree wrap are to be removed within one
year of planting.
§ 6.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.2
46:6-9
2. All landscaped areas shall be provided with a readily available and
acceptable water supply, or with at least one outlet located within
150 feet of all planted material to be maintained.
3. Landscaping materials and arrangement shall ensure adequate
sight visibility for motorists, adequate clearance for pedestrians and
vehicles, and accessibility to fire hydrants.
4. Plantings within 15 feet of a fire hydrant shall be no taller than six
inches at maturity.
5. Culs-de-sac, site entrances and boulevard medians shall be
landscaped with species tolerant of roadside conditions in
southwest Michigan.
6. Landscaping within the site shall be approved in consideration of
sight distance, size of planting area, location of sidewalks,
maintenance of adequate overhead clearance, accessibility to fire
hydrants, visibility to approved signs of adjacent uses, compatibility
with the visual character of the surrounding area, and curbing
around landscape areas.
J. Incentives to Preserve Existing Trees. The City encourages the
preservation of quality and mature trees by providing credits toward the
required landscaping. Trees intended to be preserved shall be indicated
with a special symbol on the site plan and shall be protected during
construction through use of a fence around the drip line (an illustration
of which is provided in the Recommended Landscaping Standards in the
City of Kalamazoo). To obtain credit, the preserved trees shall be of a
high quality and at least 2 1/2 inches DBH. Trees to be preserved shall be
counted for credit only if they are located on the developed portion of
the site as determined by Site Plan Review Committee or Planning
Commission. The credit for preserved trees shall be as shown in Table
6.2-1. Any preserved trees for which credit is given, and that are lost to
damage or disease within two years such credit is awarded shall be
replaced by the landowner with trees otherwise required.

K. Special Provisions for Existing Sites.
1. Intent. Special provision is made for applying these standards to
improved sites that were developed prior to October 18, 2005. When
an existing site is undergoing any external alteration or expansion,
§ 6.2 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.2
46:6-10
§ 6.3. Screening and Fences.
the objective of these standards is to gradually bring the existing
site into compliance with the minimum standards of § 6.2, with
the degree of compliance being appropriate in light of the extent
of expansion or change on a site. When reviewing plans for a
change in use or expansion that requires site plan or sketch plan
review, the Site Plan Review Committee or Planning Commission,
as appropriate, shall require an upgrade in landscaping, using the
following as guidelines:
a) Each building expansion of 1% of gross floor area shall include
at least 4% of the landscaping required for the entire site. The
calculations shall be based upon the landscaping requirements
for all existing and proposed developments on the site. All
fractional calculations shall be rounded up.
b) The estimated cost of landscaping added shall generally be
equal to at least 5% of the estimated value of the new
construction.
c) Landscaping along the street and as a buffer between adjacent
land uses will take priority over parking lot and site landscaping,
particularly where there is no excess parking over that required
by ordinance. Where parking lot landscaping cannot be
provided, additional landscaping along the street or in the
buffer areas may be substituted.
d) A reduction of minimum off-street parking requirements
established in § 6.1: Off-Street Parking and Loading by up to
10% may be approved if required to accommodate required
street frontage landscaping or parking area landscaping.
A. Fence and Wall Standards for Residential Uses. All fences or walls
erected in residential zone districts, or on lots containing residential
uses, shall comply with the following standards.
1. Placement.
a) Fences shall be installed entirely within the confines of a
residential lot.
b) Whenever any fence will be visible from public rights-of-way or
adjacent properties, it shall be installed so that the more
finished side (i.e. the side with fewer or no visible structural
framing or bracing elements) faces outward from the lot on
which it is installed.
2. Height. Fences and walls shall not exceed a height, as measured
from natural grade levels, of four feet in front setbacks and seven
feet in side and rear yards. On corner lots where the primary
structure faces the shorter dimension of a block face, fences and
§ 6.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.3
46:6-11
walls shall not exceed a height, measured from natural grade levels,
of four feet between the street property line and building setback on
the adjacent lot, and in no case shall the four foot maximum height
requirement apply more than 30 feet from the street property line.
Fences may be located on top of walls, but the combined height of
the fence and wall together, measured from natural grade at the
base of any wall, shall not exceed the maximum height permitted
for a fence or wall by itself.
3. Materials.
a) No chain-link fence shall be installed in any front setback or
front yard.
b) No fence with opacity of more than 75% shall be installed in any
front setback or front yard.
c) No plywood fences and woven plastic or metal slat fences shall
be installed.
d) No fence or wall made of debris, junk, or waste materials shall
be installed unless such materials have been recycled and
reprocessed into building materials marketed to the general
public and resembling new building materials. Barbed wire and
razor wire on fencing shall comply with § 22-14 of the
Kalamazoo General Code.
B. Fence and Wall Standards for Nonresidential Uses. All fences or walls
erected in nonresidential zone districts, or on lots containing no
residential uses, shall comply with the following standards.
1. Placement.
a) Fences shall be installed entirely within the confines of the lot.
b) Whenever any fence will be visible from public rights-of-way or
adjacent properties, it shall be installed so that the more
finished side (i.e. the side with fewer or no visible structural
framing or bracing elements) faces outward from the lot on
which it is installed.
2. Height. Fences and walls shall not exceed a height, as measured
from natural grade levels, of six feet in front setbacks or front yards,
and eight feet in side and rear yards. Fences may be located on top
of walls, but the combined height of the fence and wall together,
measured from natural grade at the base of any wall, shall not
exceed the maximum height permitted for a fence or wall by itself.
3. Materials.
a) No chain-link fence shall be installed in any front setback or
front yard.
§ 6.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.3
46:6-12
b) No fence with opacity of more than 75% shall be installed in any
front setback or front yard.
c) No plywood fences and woven plastic or metal slat fences shall
be installed.
d) No fence or wall made of debris, junk, or waste materials shall
be installed unless such materials have been recycled and
reprocessed into building materials marketed to the general
public and resembling new building materials. Barbed wire and
razor wire on fencing shall comply with Section 22.14 of the
Kalamazoo General Code.
C. Screening of Mechanical Equipment. All roof mounted or ground
mounted mechanical equipment on a building or structure containing
predominantly commercial, industrial, civic, or multifamily uses shall be
screened from view (a) from any adjacent public right-of-way, and (b)
from any R district located within 150 feet of the subject lot, through the
use of an opaque screening or parapet wall, or (in the case of ground
mounted equipment) through the use of dense vegetation sufficient to
block view of the equipment.
Figure 6-4: Screening Within 150 feet of a Residential District
§ 6.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.3
46:6-13
Figure 6-5: Screening From a Public Right-of-Way
D. Screening of Waste Receptacles. All waste receptacles larger than two
cubic yards, and all waste receptacles for nonresidential uses, shall be
located (a) in the rear or to the side of the primary structure, and (b) at
least 20 feet from any street, public sidewalk, internal pedestrian way, or
boundary with any lot containing a residential use, and (c) not on any
required off-street parking or loading space. Each waste receptacle area
shall be screened from view from all property lines by an opaque fence
or wall constructed of permitted materials, and with an opaque gate
constructed of permitted materials, both of which shall be between six
and eight feet in height. The access to this enclosure shall be screened
with an opaque gate, and wheel stops shall be provided to prevent
damage to screening materials from motor vehicles. All properties that
are not in compliance with the requirements of this Subsection D on
October 18, 2005, shall be brought into compliance within 24 months
after October 18, 2005. This latter provision shall become effective after
the City Commission approves, by resolution, rules and regulations
governing its implementation.
§ 6.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.3
46:6-14
Figure 6-6: Screening of Waste Receptacles
E. Screening of Drive-Through Facilities.
1. From Adjacent Streets. All drive-through facilities, including all
driveways, entrances and appurtenant structures, shall be set back
(a) a minimum of three feet from any adjacent street, if the property
is located in the CCBD zone district, and (b) a minimum of five feet
from any adjacent street, if the property is located in any other zone
district. The required setback area shall contain a decorative wall or
fence with a minimum height of four feet to screen the drive-up
facility from view from adjacent streets.
2. From Adjacent Residential Areas. All drive-through facilities,
including driveways and appurtenant structures, shall be screened
from all adjacent properties located in a residential zone, or
containing a residential use, through the use of a buffer strip at least
five feet in width along such boundary. Such buffer strip shall
contain a solid brick or masonry wall four feet in height located on
the edge of the buffer strip furthest from the residential use, and the
space between such wall and the property boundary shall be
landscaped with a minimum of one shrub per 10 feet of wall length.
Speakers and lights related to the drive-through use shall be
§ 6.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.3
46:6-15
§ 6.4. Lighting.
oriented so that they do not direct glare or sound towards the
residential use, and the maximum sound volume of any speaker,
measured at the property boundary, shall not exceed 50 decibels.
A. Purpose. All site lighting should be designed and installed to maintain
adequate lighting on site and provide security for people and property,
through the use of fixtures that are durable, while avoiding the use of tall
light fixtures that unnecessarily disperse light to surrounding areas, and
preventing the creation of glare on adjacent properties.
B. Applicability. All development or redevelopment (a) in any Commercial,
Public and Institutional, or Manufacturing zone district, and (b) of a
multifamily residential use in any zone district, shall comply with the
following standards.
C. Design Standards.
1. Wall-Mounted Lights. Wall-mounted lights must have fully shielded
luminairies (such as shoebox or can-style fixtures) to direct all light
downward, and to prevent the light source from being visible from
any adjacent residential property or public street. Unshielded
wallpack lights are prohibited.
2. Direction of Lighting.
a) No light source shall be directly visible from any adjacent
property located in a residential zone district.
b) No light sources shall be directed outward toward property
boundaries or adjacent rights-of-way.
c) No light source shall provide direct, general illumination of
facades of buildings visible from adjacent residential properties.
Accent lighting (such as lighting emphasizing building
entryways or key features) is permitted.
d) Wherever possible, lighting of nonresidential properties should
be directed downward. Upward-directed lighting shall not be
used to illuminate nonresidential properties, except for lowvoltage
architectural lighting.
e) Architectural, landscape, and decorative lighting used to
illuminate flags, statues, or any other objects shall use a
narrowly directed light whose light source is not visible from
adjacent residential properties or public streets.
3. Shielding.
a) Exterior. Light fixtures in excess of 60 watts or one 100 lumens
shall use full cut-off lenses or hoods to prevent glare and
§ 6.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.4
46:6-16
spillover from the project site onto adjacent properties and
roadways.
b) Interior. No interior light source shall emit light directly onto
adjacent residential property.
c) Canopies. No light source in a canopy structure shall extend
downward further than the lowest edge of the canopy ceiling.
Figure 6-7: Shielding Examples
4. Hue. Approved lighting sources shall be color-correct types such as
halogen or metal halide. Lighting types of limited spectral emission,
such as low-pressure sodium or mercury vapor lights, are prohibited.
5. Maximum Initial Lamp Wattage. Maximum initial lamp wattage shall
not exceed:
a) Residential. Sixty watts for five or fewer parking spaces. One
hundred watts for six or more spaces.
b) Nonresidential. 250 watts for five or fewer parking spaces. Four
hundred watts for six or more spaces.
6. Illumination Levels.
a) Parking Areas. All lighting in parking areas shall be designed
and maintained to produce at least 0.1 footcandle of light at
pavement level throughout the parking area. Potentially
hazardous locations must be individually illuminated with at
least 0.3 footcandle of light. Lights within 100 feet of a
residential property line shall be reduced to no more than 0.05
footcandle of light after business hours.
b) Spillover Light. Lighting from a property containing a
nonresidential primary use shall not create greater than 0.05
§ 6.4 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.4
46:6-17
§ 6.5. Design Standards.
footcandle of spillover light at the border with any single-family
zone district.
7. Uniformity Ratios. The ratio of maximum to minimum lighting on a
given property, measured at ground level, shall not exceed 15:1 in
any Residential zone district, and shall not exceed 10:1 in any
Commercial, Manufacturing, or Special Purpose zone district.
8. Canopy Lighting.
a) In order to minimize direct glare, light fixtures mounted on
gasoline and fuel sales canopies and other canopies shall be
recessed so that the lens cover is flush with the bottom surface
of the canopy or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the
canopy so that light is restrained to 85° or less from horizontal.
b) As an alternative (or supplement) to recessed lighting, indirect
lighting may be used where light is beamed upward and then
reflected down from the underside of the canopy. When this
method is used, light fixtures must be shielded so that direct
light is focused exclusively on the underside of the canopy and
is not visible from any residential use adjacent to or across a
street or alley from the subject property, or from any public
right-of-way.
c) Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides (fascias) of the
canopy. Signing that is in compliance with sign regulations may
be placed on these surfaces.
D. Height Standards.
1. Except as permitted in Subsection 2 below, lighting fixtures shall be
no more than 15 feet high whether mounted on poles or walls or by
other means.
2. Light fixtures in parking lots containing more than 50 spaces shall
be no more than (a) 20 feet high if located within 100 feet of the
boundary of a residential zone district, or (b) 25 feet high if located
100 feet or more from the boundary of a residential zone district.
[Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
3. Wherever possible, illumination of seating areas, building entrances,
and walkways shall be accomplished by use of bollard-style fixtures
or other low, ground-mounted fixtures not over four feet in height.
A. Neighborhood Commercial. The following standards shall apply to all
nonresidential development in all Residential zone districts and in the
CNO, CN-1, CN-2 and CMU zone districts, where the proposed
development or redevelopment has less than 50,000 square feet of
gross floor area. They are intended to ensure that development in each
§ 6.4 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.5
46:6-18
coveted zone district occurs in a manner that is compatible with
adjacent residential neighborhoods and that encourages pedestrian
access. Alternative design solutions may be approved during the site
plan review process (See § 8.3H: Site Plan) if it is demonstrated that
the alternative design solution meets the intent of § 6.5B or if it is
determined that application of these standards to a development
approved before October 18, 2005 is not feasible. [Amended
3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
Figure 6-8: Neighborhood Commercial
1. Quality of Materials.
a) Front Facades. When the principal entrance of a freestanding
building is on the side elevation or at the corner of the front and
side elevations, that side elevation shall include the same
quality of materials, trim levels, and degree of articulation as
those found on the front facade.
b) Side and Rear Facades. Rear and side facades of all
nonresidential buildings facing a public street, park, playground
or other public open space shall incorporate the same quality of
materials, trim levels, and degree of articulation predominantly
§ 6.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.5
46:6-19
found on the front facade of the building. Parking, service,
or other open spaces at the rear of the structure shall be
maintained in a neat and orderly condition.
c) Restrictions on Pre-Cast Materials. To the maximum extent
practicable, concrete finishes or precast concrete panels (tilt
walls) shall not be used as exterior building materials unless
they are exposed aggregate, hammered, embossed, patterned,
imprinted, sandblasted or covered with a cement-based acrylic
coating.
d) Restrictions on Metal Panels. To the maximum extent
practicable, metal panel systems, used as an exterior building
material, should be a minimum thickness of U.S. Standard 18
gauge metal. Corrugated (ribbed) metal panels and siding shall
be prohibited on all exterior walls except as a method of
screening mechanical roof top equipment.
e) Restrictions on Mirrored Glass. To the maximum extent
practicable, mirrored glass with a reflectance greater than 40%
shall not be used to cover more than 40% of the exterior walls
of any building.
2. Building Orientation. To the maximum extent practicable, and
except as otherwise expressly required or unless necessary to avoid
site access through an alley adjacent to a residential zoning district,
the front or side facade shall face the public street abutting the front
property line and at least 50% of the horizontal length of the first
floor of the front facade shall be set back not more than 60 feet from
said street. To the maximum extent practicable, the main entrance
shall face the public street abutting the front property line or face a
connecting walkway with a direct pedestrian connection to the
public street abutting the front property line.
3. Outdoor Storage and Display. Outdoor storage and display is
prohibited for all nonresidential development in all Residential zone
districts, and in the CNO and CO zone districts. Outdoor display of
products for sale or rent shall be allowed in the CMU, CN-1, CN-2, CC,
and CCBD zone districts, provided that such display is accessory to
an indoor primary use on the property, is not located in the public
right-of-way, does not block sidewalks, parking areas, or driveways,
and is maintained in a neat and orderly manner. Outdoor storage of
supplies, materials, and equipment not for sale or rent, with the
exception of vehicles associated with the allowed use on the site,
shall not be permitted in the CMU, CN-1, CN-2, CC, and CCBD zone
districts. [Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
4. Location of Off-Street Parking and Other Vehicular Use Areas.
a) CNO and CN-1 Districts. Front yards must be reserved for
landscaping, sidewalks, and driveway access. Off-street parking
spaces may not be located between a street property line and
§ 6.5 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.5
46:6-20
the building line of the principal building on the site. Such
spaces may be located in side and rear yards if screened from
adjacent dwellings by a solid wall, fence or vegetation that is
not less than four feet and not more than six feet in height.
Vegetation may exceed six feet in height.
b) CN-2 and CMU Districts. Whenever possible, vehicular use
areas, including driveways, loading areas, and off-street parking
areas, shall not be located on any portion of a lot adjacent to a
residential area. Where location of vehicular use areas adjacent
to a residential area is unavoidable or unfeasible, buffering shall
be provided as required in § 6.2H.2: Commercial Uses Abutting
Residential Uses or Residential Zoning District In the case of
construction of new primary structures commenced after
October 18, 2005, no more than 50% of required off-street
parking areas shall be located between the front facade of a
principal building and the adjacent public street. [Amended
3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
5. Service Areas. In commercial developments containing less than
20,000 square feet of gross floor area, service functions (shipping/
receiving, trash removal, etc.) shall be integrated into the circulation
pattern in a manner that minimizes conflicts with vehicles and
pedestrians. In commercial developments containing 20,000 square
feet or more of gross floor area, service and loading areas shall be
separated from main circulation and parking areas and away from
public streets.
6. Additional Requirements for the CNO District. Door styles must be
similar to those found on residential buildings on the block, and new
construction (including building additions and rehabilitations) must
be designed to have the appearance of other residential buildings
along the street.
7. Additional Requirements for CN-1 District. Exterior building
materials along street facing facades (exterior walls that face
streets or sidewalks), not including windows and entries, must
consist primarily of masonry, not including concrete block or
concrete masonry units. Vinyl and aluminum siding are prohibited.
8. Additional Standards for CN-2 and CMU Districts. [Amended
3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
a) Modular masonry materials, such as brick and concrete pavers,
or gridded cast-in-place materials, such as exposed aggregate
concrete, are required as paving materials for all pedestrian
areas in order to visually define and improve the appearance of
pedestrian areas.
b) Wherever possible, pedestrian access to adjacent residential
areas rights-of-way must be provided through the provision of
§ 6.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.5
46:6-21
sidewalks in addition to those located on adjacent public
streets.
c) Each commercial tenant space must be accessible from other
tenant spaces by sidewalks or other approved pedestrian
routes. Pedestrian routes must be continuous, with a minimum
horizontal clear space of four feet in all cases. Pedestrian routes
must be designed to offer protection to pedestrians and be
visually distinguishable from other hardscape elements on the
site. Pedestrian routes must be separated from parking and
vehicular use areas by curbs, landscaping or other physical
barriers. When pedestrian paths cross drive aisles and vehicle
travel lanes they must be clearly identified with materials such
as textured or brick paving, and must be integrated into the
wider network of pedestrian walkways. Pavement textures are
encouraged elsewhere in the parking lot, as surface materials,
or as accents.
d) Parking lot layout and design must promote safe and
convenient pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
e) Areas that are not used for vehicular and pedestrian access or
parking must be landscaped in accordance with applicable
landscape standards.
f) Buildings in the district must relate to one another, both
functionally and visually, and encourage pedestrian activity.
g) Exterior building materials along street-facing facades (exterior
walls that face streets or sidewalks), not including windows and
entries, must consist primarily of masonry, not including
concrete block or concrete masonry units. Vinyl and aluminum
siding are prohibited.
h) Buildings must avoid uninterrupted wall planes. Building wall
offsets, window patterns or other changes in elevation design
must be used to give buildings the appearance of small
individual store fronts that are no more than 25 feet in width.
Similarly, roofline offsets must be used to provide architectural
interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve
the effect of a single, long roof.
9. Additional Standards for CN-1, CN-2 and CMU Districts. [Amended
3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
a) One-story buildings must have a minimum height of 18 feet and
a maximum height of 22 feet unless there are clerestory
windows facing the street that give the appearance of second
floor space.
b) At least 60% of all street-facing facades, measured from grade
to a height of 10 feet above finished grade, must be comprised
§ 6.5 KALAMAZOO CODE § 6.5
46:6-22
of windows that allow views into business or commercial use
areas. The bottom of windows used to satisfy this requirement
must be no more than three feet above the adjacent finished
grade.
c) Bicycle parking facilities must be located in convenient areas of
the development and must be located so as not to impede
pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
d) Air-conditioning units, HVAC systems, exhaust pipes or stacks,
elevator housing and satellite dishes and other
telecommunications-receiving devices must be screened from
view from the public right-of-way and from residential areas, by
using walls, fencing, roof elements, penthouse-type screening
devices or landscaping.
B. Large Retail Establishments. Each single-story primary structure
containing primarily commercial retail sales space, and containing more
than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area shall comply with the
following design standards in addition to those set forth in Subsection A
above.
1. Building Facades.
a) Each facade greater than 100 feet in length, measured
horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses
having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade and
extending at least 20% of the length of the facade. No
uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100 horizontal
feet.
b) Each building facade shall have a repeating pattern that shall
include no less than three instances of either (a) color change,
(b) texture changes, (c) material module change, or (d)
expression of an architectural or structural bay through a
change in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an
offset, reveal, or projecting rib. At least one of those elements
shall repeat horizontally at an interval of no more than 30 feet.
c) Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades,
display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features
along no less than 60% of their horizontal length.
2. Parapets. Each primary structure with a flat roof shall have parapets
or enclosures concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment from
public view, and such parapets and enclosures shall be constructed
of materials that match the building in quality and detail. Each such
parapet or enclosure shall have an average height of no more than
15% of the height of the supporting wall, a maximum height at any
point equal to 33% of the height of the supporting wall.

46:6-24
adjacent properties, and (d) to all existing or planned transit
stop or park-n-ride locations identified by the public transit
authority.
b) For proposed development that will include parking areas that
extend more than 250 feet from the primary structure, the
developments shall provide a designated walkway from the row
of parking furthest from the primary structure to a primary
structure entrance used by residents, employees, or the public,
or to a sidewalk leading to such entrance. Such walkways shall
be distinguished from surrounding parking areas by changes in
color or texture, raised surfaces, or landscaped edges.
c) All development shall provide (a) a walkway at least six feet
wide extending across the front of each primary structure, and
(b) weather protection features such as awnings or arcades at
each entrance used by residents, employees, or the public.
5. Site Layout, Auto Access, and Parking.
a) At least 50% of off-street parking shall be located behind or at
the sides of primary structures (rather than between the front of
primary buildings and the street) or within structured parking.
b) Driveways shall be consolidated to the greatest degree possible
to reduce the number of sidewalk/driveway crossing points.
c) Short-term (public), and long-term (resident and employee)
parking shall be clearly signed, and short-term parking areas
shall generally be located closer to the primary public entrances
to primary structures.
C. Downtown Design Standards and Guidelines. [Amended 7-16-2012 by
Ord. No. 1897]
(1) The Downtown Design Standards and Guidelines (Standards &
Guidelines) are adopted and incorporated into this ordinance by
reference. All development in the geographic boundary area defined
in Subsection C(2) shall follow those design and development
regulations set forth in the Standards & Guidelines.
(2) The Standards & Guidelines apply to all buildings, structures,
properties and uses in the same geographic boundary area to which
the City of Kalamazoo Downtown Development Authority applies
(Such area is identified as DDA District and is further depicted in the
City of Kalamazoo Zoning Code, under § 2.3G.), and also apply to all
buildings, structures, properties and uses in the Southtown Design
Review District, except structures solely used as single-family
residential structures, duplex homes, and multifamily residential
structures. The Southtown Design Review District is defined as all
parcels bordered by E. Walnut Street to the north, Portage Street to
the east, Stockbridge Avenue to the south, and S. Burdick Street to
§ 6.5 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 6.5
46:6-25
§ 6.6. Operational Performance Standards.
All structures, uses, and activities in all zone districts shall be used or
occupied so as to avoid creating any dangerous, injurious, noxious or
otherwise objectionable condition that would create adverse impacts on the
residents, employees, or visitors on the property itself or on neighboring
properties.
the west. The Standards & Guidelines apply to those buildings,
structures, properties and uses on both sides of the streets that
represent the boundaries of the DDA District and the boundaries of
the Southtown Design Review District. [Amended 2-16-2015 by
Ord. No. 1932]
(3) Before any building, structure or property located in the DDA District

are, or may be located, maintain residential neighborhoods, generally
reduce the overall number and impact of billboard advertising in the City
and positively affect traffic safety, community aesthetics, and
environmental conditions.
§ 7.4 KALAMAZOO CODE § 7.4A
46:7-10
B. To achieve and further these purposes, any internally illuminated,
automatic changeable copy signs, such as, but not limited to, signs using
LED technology, are permitted as a lawful conforming off-premises sign
in compliance with the following requirements:
1. Location. Such signs shall only be located in CCBD, CC, M-1, and M-2
zoning districts when:
(a) Located on sites where an off-premises sign that is 200 square
feet or more existed as of July 1, 2013, that is adjacent to state
or federally controlled roads; and
(b) More than 300 feet away from a residential zoning district,
except on West Main Street from Northampton Road west to the
City limits if more than 100 feet away from a preexisting
residential use; and
(c) Whose sign face area does not exceed that of the static sign
face or faces being replaced; and is not less than 2,500 feet
from another off-premises internally illuminated automatic
changeable copy sign.
2. Sign Support Structure Elimination Credits.
(a) Notwithstanding the total number of off-premises signs located
in the City, so as to reduce the overall number of
nonconforming off-premises signs, the erection of, installation
of, or upgrade of a static display or manual changeable copy
sign to an off-premises internally illuminated automatic
changeable copy sign shall require the elimination of existing
nonconforming off-premises signs within the City. The
installation, erection or upgrade of any existing sign to an
internally illuminated automatic changeable copy sign shall
require the sign owner to secure six sign support structure
elimination credits.
(b) The elimination of an off-premises sign support structure in an
R, CO, CN-1, or CCBD zoning district shall count for two credits;
elimination of an off-premises sign support structure in all other
zoning districts shall count as one credit. Only whole numbers
shall be applied to credits used to erect, install or upgrade an
off-premises automatic changeable copy sign, and any credits
more than the amount required to qualify for the erection of,
installation of, or upgrade of a static display or manual
changeable copy sign to an off-premises internally illuminated
automatic changeable copy sign shall not be available for future
use.
(c) In order to qualify for an elimination credit, the off-premises
sign support structure shall be completely removed and the
property site returned to as good or better condition as existed
before the sign support structure was installed.

flashing lights are only permitted within the CCBD and CC zoning
districts, and shall be limited as follows:
1. No light shall blink, flash, or change its intensity or color more often
than one time every 10 seconds.
2. If a sign displays images or messages that change automatically,

structure shall obtain the prior written permission of the owner to place
the mural on the building or structure. Such lessee or other person with
the right of occupancy shall provide a copy of the letter to the City
Planner if requested.
C. Permit Required. A mural that is produced off-site and affixed in a
structurally sound and workmanlike manner on the exterior wall and that
is larger than 200 square feet shall require a permit under the provisions
of § 8.3I, Sign Permit.
D. Windows, Doors and Other Architectural Features. No mural shall

require the prompt removal of the mural. If not removed within 30
days, the City shall have the right to remove the mural and place
a lien against the real property (enforced in the same manner as
delinquent property taxes) for the cost incurred in removing the
mural if such costs are not paid prior to when delinquent taxes are

considered during review of the application that might
reasonably affect the decision-making body's application of the
relevant review standards to the development proposed in the
application; or
b) New or Additional Information. New or additional information is
available that was not available at the time of the review that
might reasonably affect the decision-making body's application
of the relevant review standards to the development proposed;
or
c) New Application Materially Different. A new application is
proposed to be submitted that is materially different from the
prior application; or
d) Material Mistake of Fact. The final decision on the application
was based on a material mistake or omission of fact that, if

that meeting to offer such testimony or evidence for the record.
Such offer shall be made at the public hearing.
5. Continuance of Public Hearing.
a) General. The body conducting the public hearing may, on its
own motion or at the request of any person, continue the public
hearing to a fixed date, time and place. An applicant shall have
the right to request and be granted one continuance; however,

of the body conducting the public hearing only upon good cause
shown.

intense zone district than requested by the applicant. In determining
whether to adopt or disapprove the proposed amendment, the City
Commission shall consider the following factors:
a) Consistent With Comprehensive Plan. Whether and the extent
to which the proposed amendment is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan.
b) Changed Conditions. Whether and the extent to which there are
changed conditions that require an amendment.
c) Community Need. Whether and the extent to which the
proposed amendment addresses a demonstrated community
need.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-12
d) Compatible With Surrounding Uses. Whether and the extent to
which the proposed amendment is compatible with existing and
proposed uses surrounding the subject land, and is the
appropriate zone district for the land, or the proposed
amendment to the text of this Ordinance will maintain or
improve compatibility among uses and will ensure efficient
development within the City.
e) Development Patterns. Whether and the extent to which the
proposed amendment would result in a logical and orderly
development pattern.
C. Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O).
1. General. Proposed Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) zone
district shall comply with all applicable requirement of § 3.4:
Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) Zone District, and with
this standards and criteria set forth in this § 8.3C.
2. General Applicability. Before any development shall be designated
as a Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) zone district on the
Zone District Map, it shall receive approval pursuant to the terms of
this section.
3. Procedure.
a) Overview. A Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) District
shall constitute an amendment to the Zone District Map. It shall
be controlled by a PUD Plan and PUD Agreement that is
approved as part of the Planned Unit Development Overlay
(PUD-O) zone district classification. The procedure requires
review and recommendation of approval, approval with
conditions or disapproval by the Planning Commission and
review and approval, approval with conditions or disapproval by
the City Commission. Subsequent to development of a Planned
Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) district, a site plan shall be
approved pursuant to § 8.3.H: Site Plan.
b) General. The procedures and requirements for a Planned Unit
Development Overlay (PUD-O) district classification shall
comply with the requirements of § 8.1: General Provisions.
4. Standards In approving a Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUDO)
zone district classification, the City Commission shall find the
zone district designation and PUD Plan complies with the following
standards:
a) Development Parameters.
1) The proposed uses for the development may be varied from
the permitted uses and special uses for the underlying base
zone district identified in § 4.1: Use Table.
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-13
2) The dimensional standards may vary from the
requirements in § 5.1: Density/Intensity/Dimensional
Standards Table.
3) The development is comprehensively planned and
integrated, compact, and, where possible, linked by
pedestrian ways to surrounding properties.
4) The development is compatible with the character of
surrounding land uses and maintains and enhances the
value of surrounding properties.
b) Signs. Signage complies with Chapter 7: Signs, except that
signage standards may vary from Chapter 7: Signs, if a
comprehensive sign plan for the proposed development is
submitted that is determined to be suitable for the PUD Plan,
and it is consistent with the intent and purpose of the sign
regulations.
c) Public Facilities.
1) The PUD Plan demonstrates a safe and adequate on-site
transportation circulation system that is integrated with the
off-site transportation circulation system of the City.
2) The PUD Plan demonstrates a safe and adequate on-site
system of potable water and wastewater lines that can
accommodate the proposed development, that are
efficiently integrated into off-site potable water and
wastewater public improvement plans.
3) Adequate off-site facilities for potable water supply, sewage
disposal, solid waste disposal, electrical supply, fire
protection and roads is planned and programmed for the
development proposed in the PUD Plan, and the
development is conveniently located in relation to schools
and police protection services.
4) The improvements standards applicable to the public
facilities that will serve the site comply with the relevant
City regulations. Provided, however, the development may
deviate from the City's road standards so the development
achieves greater efficiency of infrastructure design and
installation through clustered or compact forms of
development, when the following minimum design
principles are followed:
(a) The circulation system is designed to provide safe,
convenient access to all areas of the proposed
development using the minimum practical roadway
length. Access is provided by a public right-of-way,
private vehicular or pedestrian way or a commonly
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-14
owned easement Internal pathways are provided to
form a logical, safe and convenient system for
pedestrian access to dwelling units and common areas,
with appropriate linkages off-site.
(b) Roadways are designed to permit access by
emergency vehicles to all lots and/or units. An access
easement is granted for emergency vehicles and utility
vehicles, as applicable, to use roadways in the
development for the purpose of providing emergency
services and for installation, maintenance and repair of
utilities.
(c) Principal vehicular access points are designed to
provide for smooth traffic flow, minimizing hazards to
vehicular, pedestrian, or bicycle traffic. Where a PUD-O
district abuts a major collector, arterial road, or
highway, direct access to the road or highway from
individual lots, units, or buildings is not permitted,
unless specifically approved as part of the PUD-O
district.
d) Open Space. The development proposed in the PUD Plan
complies with the following open space standards:
1) A minimum of 35% of the gross land in the PUD Plan is
reserved for common recreation and usable open space.
Parking areas, street right-of-way and minimum yard
setbacks shall not be counted when determining usable
open space. Water bodies and floodplains that are
preserved as open space shall count towards this minimum
standard, even when they are not usable by or accessible
to the residents of the development.
2) All privately owned common open space shall continue to
conform to its intended use, as specified in the PUD Plan. To
ensure that all the common open space identified in the
PUD Plan will be used as common open space, restrictions
and/or covenants shall be placed in each deed to ensure
their maintenance and to prohibit the partition of any
common open space.
e) Natural Resource and Environmental Protection. The PUD Plan
complies with the current regulatory standards of this
Ordinance and other relevant City, state and federal regulations
related to natural resource and environmental protection.
f) Phasing. The PUD Plan includes a phasing plan for the
development, if appropriate, with specific build-out dates and
the necessary components to insure protection of natural
resources and the health, safety, and welfare of the users of the
planned unit development and the residents of the surrounding
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-15
area. If development of the planned unit development is
proposed to occur in phases, then guarantees shall be provided
that project improvements and amenities that are necessary
and desirable for residents of the project, or that are of benefit
to the City, are constructed with the first phase of the project,
or, if this is not possible, then as early in the project as is
technically feasible.
g) Consistent With Comprehensive Plan. The PUD Plan is
consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan.
h) Complies With This Ordinance. The PUD Plan complies with all
other relevant requirements of this Ordinance.
5. Conditions. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to
recommend and the City Commission shall have the authority to
impose such conditions on a Planned Development (PUD) Overlay
zone district classification and PUD Plan that are necessary to
accomplish the purposes of this Ordinance.
6. Planned Unit Development (PUD) Agreement. Concurrent with the
approval of the adopting ordinance for the PUD Overlay zone district
classification and the PUD Plan, a PUD Agreement shall be
established binding the Planned Development to any conditions
placed in the adopting ordinance and PUD Plan. To the degree
necessary and appropriate, the PUD Agreement shall include, but is
not limited to conditions related to: design requirements; a phasing
plan; open space; a comprehensive sign plan; landscaping; parking;
and public facility improvements and phasing.
7. Placement of Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay District
Designation on Official Zone District Map. After final approval of the
adopting ordinance for the Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUDO)
zone district classification, the PUD Plan and PUD Agreement, the
City Planner shall amend the Zone District Map to show a Planned
Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) zone district classification.
8. Recordation. The applicant shall record the adopting ordinance for
the Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) zone district
classification, the PUD Plan and the PUD Agreement with the County
Registrar of Deeds. They shall be binding upon the landowners, their
successors and assigns, and shall constitute the development
regulations for the land. Development of the land shall be limited to
the uses, density, configuration, design guidelines and all other
elements and conditions set forth on the PUD Plan and PUD
Agreement. The applicant shall submit proof to the City Planner that
the adopting ordinance, PUD Plan, and PUD Agreement have been
recorded with the County Registrar of Deeds within 180 calendar
days of its approval or the adopting ordinance, PUD Plan, and PUD
Agreement shall be rendered invalid and the property shall return to
its prior zone district classification.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-16
9. Effect. Approval of an adopting ordinance for a Planned Unit
Development Overlay (PUD-O) zone district classification, the PUD
Plan and PUD Agreement shall constitute a Zone District Map
classification and recognition by the City that the landowner may
proceed, consistent with the PUD Plan and PUD Agreement to
develop the land, with appropriate site plan review and permit
approvals.
10. Expiration.
a) General. The approval of a PUD Plan, and PUD Agreement if
applicable shall be null and void unless construction of required
improvements is commenced and diligently pursued to
completion, and a site plan is submitted for at least the initial
phase of the PUD Plan within three years after the date of
approval of the Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O)
Overlay zone district classification. Such time period will not be
extended with transfer of ownership.
b) One Extension. Upon written request, one extension of time
may be granted by the City Commission for a period not to
exceed one year for good cause shown. No request for an
extension shall be considered unless a written request is
submitted to the City Planner no later than 30 days prior to the
date the PUD Plan is to expire. The approval shall be deemed
extended until the City Commission has acted upon the request
for extension. Failure to submit an application for an extension
within the time limits established by this section shall render
invalid the PUD Plan, and PUD Agreement if applicable.
c) Effect of Invalidation. If an adopted PUD Plan, and PUD
Agreement if applicable, becomes invalid through the operation
of Subsection (a) or (b) above, no further development within
the approved PUD-O zone district may take place until a new
PUD Plan, and PUD Agreement if applicable, has been approved
in the same manner required for the approval of the original
PUD Plan. At any time after the invalidation of a PUD Plan, and
PUD Agreement if applicable, the City Commission may, upon
its own initiative, rezone the property in the approved PUD-O
districts back to the zone district that existed prior to the
approval of the PUD-O district, or to any other zone district
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
11. Minor Deviations. A minor deviation to a PUD Plan and/or a PUD
Agreement may be approved by the City Planner. In making a
decision on a minor deviation the City Planner shall identify the facts
and standards of this section that permit the approval or disapproval
of the minor deviation. A minor deviation shall be limited to
technical or engineering considerations first discovered during
actual development that could not reasonably be anticipated during
the approval process or any other change that has no material effect
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-17
on the character of the approved planned unit development or any
of its approved terms or conditions, as long as it complies with the
standards of this Ordinance. Minor deviations shall be limited to the
following:
a) Height. An increase of building height by not more than 10%, as
long as the height increase is consistent with the contextual
height of the surrounding buildings and structures and the PUD
Plan.
b) Alteration of the Building Envelope. Alteration of the building
envelope of up to 10%, provided such alteration does not
materially change the design of the development approved in
the PUD Plan, and does not change the number of stories,
density or intensity.
c) Reduction of Open Space. Reduction of the total amount of open
space by not more than 1%, as long as 20% of the project is
maintained in open space.
d) Parking Spaces. A decrease of parking spaces by not more than
5%, if it is demonstrated that the minor deviation complies with
requirements of § 6.1: Off-Street Parking and Loading.
e) Relocation of Buildings. Relocation of buildings or uses, as long
as they maintain the same general building relationships,
topography, landscaping, and utility design and are consistent
with the PUD Plan, as long as any required setbacks are
maintained.
12. Amendments. An amendment to a PUD Plan and/or PUD Agreement
may be made only pursuant to the procedures and standards for its
original approval.
D. Special Use Permit.
1. Purpose. Special uses are those uses that may have a greater
propensity to adversely affect surrounding uses in a zone district
and, therefore, require special and individual review of their
location, design, configuration, intensity, and density of use or
structures to ensure land use compatibility, public facility adequacy,
natural resource protection and the public health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the City. Conditions of approval may be imposed
on a special use that is pertinent to the particular use at a particular
location.
2. Authorization.
a) General. The Planning Commission, in accordance with the
procedures and standards of this section, shall review, consider
and approve, approve with conditions or disapprove special use
permits.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-18
b) Uses Authorized. Only those uses authorized as special uses in
§ 4.1: Use Table, may be approved as special uses. The
designation of a use as a special use in § 4.1: Use Table, does
not constitute an authorization that such use shall be approved
as a special use pursuant to this section. Rather, each proposed
special use shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission for
compliance with the standards set forth in this section and the
applicable supplementary standards for the use in § 4.2: Use
Standards.
3. Procedure. The procedures and requirements for a special use
permit shall comply with the requirements of § 8.1: General
Provisions.
Special Use Permit
4. Standards. The Planning Commission shall approve a special use
permit if it finds there is evidence in the record that demonstrates all
of the following are met:
a) Compatibility. The proposed special use is appropriate for its
proposed location and compatible with the character of
surrounding land uses and the uses permitted in the zone
district(s) of surrounding lands.
b) Zone District Use Standards. The proposed special use complies
with § 4.2: Use Standards.
c) Location and Design Minimizes Adverse Impact. The location
and design of the proposed special use minimizes adverse
effects, including visual impact of the proposed use on adjacent
lands by:
1) Avoiding significant adverse impact on surrounding lands
regarding service delivery, parking and loading, odors,
noise, glare, and vibration, and does not create a nuisance.
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-19
2) Retaining, to the greatest extent possible, the natural
features of the landscape where they provide a barrier or
buffer between the proposed special use and adjoining
lands.
3) Locating buildings, structures, and entryways to minimize
impact.
4) Providing appropriate screening, fencing, landscaping, and
setbacks.
d) Design Minimizes Environmental Impact. The proposed special
use minimizes environmental impacts, and conforms to all
relevant environmental protection standards of this Ordinance,
or any other state or federal laws.
e) Off-Site Roads. There is adequate road capacity available to
serve the proposed special use.
f) Road Ingress and Egress. The proposed special use is designed
to ensure safe ingress and egress onto the site and safe road
conditions around the site.
g) Impact on Other Public Facilities. There are adequate potable
water, wastewater, solid waste, park, police, and fire/EMS
facilities to serve the proposed special use.
h) Access for Fire, Police, and EMS. The proposed special use is
located and designed so that adequate access onto the site is
provided for fire, police, and EMS services.
i) Site Development Standards. The proposed special use
complies with the appropriate standards in Chapter 6: General
Development Standards.
j) Other Relevant Standards of This Ordinance. The proposed
special use complies with all standards imposed on it by all
other applicable provisions of this Ordinance for use, layout,
and general development characteristics.
5. Conditions of Approval. The Planning Commission may impose, in
approving the special use, such conditions on approval of the
proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant
to such approval, as it determines are required by the standards of
this section and all other relevant standards of this Ordinance to
prevent or minimize adverse effects from the proposed use and
development on surrounding lands. All conditions imposed on any
special use shall be expressly set forth in the special use permit
approval.
6. Recording. The Planning Commission may require the applicant to
record the special use permit with the County Register of Deeds. The
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-20
special use permit shall be binding upon the landowners, their
successors and assigns.
7. Effect of Special Use Permit. Issuance of a special use permit shall
authorize only the particular use, subject to the conditions approved
in the special use permit. A special use permit, including any
conditions, shall run with the land and shall not be affected by a
change in ownership.
8. Expiration. Unless otherwise specified in the special use permit, an
application for a construction permit shall be applied for and
approved within two years of the date of the approval of the special
use permit or the special use permit shall be considered invalid.
Permitted time frames do not change with successive owners.
9. Extension. Upon written request, one extension of one year may be
granted by the Planning Commission for good cause shown.
10. Amendments. A special use permit may be amended, extended, or
modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards
established for its original approval.
E. Variances.
1. Purpose.
a) General. There are two types of variances allowed under the
terms of this Ordinance: dimensional variances and use
variances.
b) Dimensional Variances. Dimensional variances are deviations
from the height, setback, yard, lot coverage, parking,
landscaping and signage standards of this Ordinance, when
owing to special circumstances or conditions (such as
exceptional topographical conditions, narrowness, shallowness,
or the shape of a specific parcel of land), the literal enforcement
of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in peculiar and
practical difficulties to the owners of the land, and the deviation
would not be contrary to the public interest.
c) Use Variances. Use variances are variations from the schedule
of permitted uses in a zone district established pursuant to
§ 4.1: Use Table, when owing to unnecessary hardship uniquely
associated with the property, this Ordinance unreasonably
restricts the property owner's use of permitted uses.
d) No Increase in Residential Density. A request to modify lot
requirements to increase the permitted density of new
residential development shall not be considered a variance and
is prohibited (e.g., a lot modification that increases the number
of permitted dwelling units on a lot shall not be allowed).
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-21
2. Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in accordance with the
procedures, standards and limitations of this section, is authorized
to review and approve, approve with conditions or disapprove an
application for a variance (dimensional variances or use variances).
3. Procedure. The procedures and requirements for variances shall
comply with the requirements of § 8.1: General Provisions.
Variance
4. Standards.
a) Dimensional Variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
approve a dimensional variance on a finding there is
competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record
that all of the following standards are met:
1) There are special circumstances or conditions (like
exceptional topographic conditions, narrowness,
shallowness, or the shape of property) that are peculiar to
the land or structure for which the variance is sought, that
is not applicable to other land or structures in the same
zone district.
2) The special circumstances are not the result of the actions
of the applicant or titleholder of the land.
3) The literal interpretation and enforcement of the terms and
provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of
rights commonly enjoyed by other land in the same zone
district, and would cause practical difficulty.
4) The granting of the variance is the minimum action that will
make possible the use of the land or structure that is not
contrary to the public interest, and that would carry out the
spirit of this Ordinance.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-22
5) The granting of the variance will not adversely affect
adjacent land in a material way.
6) The granting of the variance will be generally consistent
with the purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
7) Where the requested dimensional variance involves
required landscaping, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
grant a variance upon the following additional criteria:
(a) Existing landscaping, screening or wetlands intended
to be preserved meets the intent of this section.
(b) The landscape design proposed by the applicant meets
the intent of this section.
(c) There is a steep change in topography that would limit
the benefits of required landscaping.
(d) The proposed building and parking lot placement is
setback well beyond the minimum required.
(e) The abutting or adjacent land is developed or will be
developed in the near future with a use other than
residential.
(f) Similar conditions to the above exist such that no good
purpose would be served by providing the landscaping
or screening required.
b) Use Variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall approve a use
variance on a finding there is competent, material, and
substantial evidence in the record that all of the following
standards are met:
1) The literal interpretation and enforcement of the terms and
provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant for
all practical purposes from using the property for a
permitted use identified in § 4.1: Use Table, which is a right
commonly enjoyed by other land in the same zone district.
2) There is unnecessary hardship based on special
circumstances or conditions that are peculiar to the land or
structure for which the use variance is sought that is not
applicable to other land or structures in the same zone
district.
3) The special circumstances are not the result of the actions
of the applicant.
4) The granting of the variance is the minimum action that will
make possible the use of the land or structure that is not
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-23
contrary to the public interest, and that would carry out the
spirit of this Ordinance.
5) The granting of the variance will not adversely affect
adjacent land in a material way.
6) The granting of the variance will be generally consistent
with the purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
5. Conditions of Approval. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in approving
the variance, may impose conditions on such approval, the
proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant
to such approval as it determines are required to ensure compliance
with the standards in this section. The conditions shall be identified
in the variance approval.
6. Recording. The Zoning Board of Appeals may require the applicant
to record the variance with the County Register of Deeds. The
variance shall be binding upon the landowners, their successors and
assigns.
7. Effect of Variance. Issuance of a variance shall authorize only the
particular variation that is approved in the variance. A variance,
including any conditions, shall run with the land and not be affected
by a change in ownership.
8. Subsequent Development. Development authorized by the variance
shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
approvals required by this Ordinance or any other applicable
provisions of the City. A variance does not ensure that the
development approved as a variance shall receive subsequent
approval for other applications for development approval unless the
relevant and applicable portions of this Ordinance or any other
applicable provisions are met.
9. Expiration. Unless otherwise specified in the variance, an
application for a construction permit shall be applied for and
approved within one year of the date of the approval of the variance,
otherwise the variance shall become invalid. Permitted time frames
do not change with successive owners.
10. Extension. Upon written request, one extension of six months may
be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals for good cause shown.
11. Amendment. A variance may be amended, extended or modified
only in accordance with the procedures and standards established
for its original approval. A request for a change in a condition of
approval of a variance shall be considered an amendment.
F. Appeals of Administrative Decisions.
1. Authorization. Any person aggrieved or effected by any order,
decision, determination, or interpretation made by the City Planner
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-24
or other administrative official of the City charged with
administration or enforcement of this Ordinance, may appeal such
decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to the procedures
and standards of this section.
2. Procedure.
a) Initiation of Appeal. An appeal pursuant to this section shall be
initiated by filing a written appeal of the administrative

proceedings by the City in furtherance of the action appealed,
unless the City Planner or other administrative official from whom
the appeal is taken certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals that a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the administrative proceedings shall not be stayed unless a
restraining order is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals for good
cause shown.
G. Administrative Adjustments.
1. General. This section sets out the procedures and standards for
administrative adjustments, which are modifications of 10% or less
of any numeric dimensional standard set out in § 5.1: Density/
Intensity/Dimensional Standards Table, except those related to
residential density or nonresidential intensity.
2. Procedure.
a) General. The procedures and requirements for initiation of an
application, the application contents, fees, application
submission, and review of the application by City staff shall
comply with those relevant provisions in § 8.1: General
Provisions.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-26
b) Action by City Planner. Within 30 days after the application is
determined sufficient, the City Planner shall review the
application and approve, approve with conditions or disapprove
the administrative adjustment based on the standards in
§ 8.3G.3: Standards.
Administrative Adjustments
3. Standards. The City Planner may approve an administrative
adjustment upon a finding that all of the following standards are
met:
a) General. The requested adjustment eliminates an unnecessary
inconvenience to the applicant, is not inconsistent with the
character of development in the surrounding area and will not
result in incompatible land uses;
b) Mitigates Adverse Impacts. Any adverse impacts resulting from
the administrative adjustment will be mitigated to the
maximum extent feasible; and
c) Technical Nature/Compensates for Unusual Aspect of Site. The
administrative adjustment is of a technical nature and is
required to compensate for some unusual aspect of the site or
the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in
general. For example: If a lot slopes so sharply at the property
boundary that the primary structure would not be visible even
without the minimum setback, and the shape of the lot makes it
difficult to meet the setback, an administrative adjustment to a
smaller setback may be appropriate.
4. Conditions of Approval. The City Planner may, in approving the
administrative adjustment, impose such restrictions and conditions
on such approval and the premises to be developed or used
pursuant to such approval as are determined are required to ensure
compliance with the general goals, objectives, and policies of this
Ordinance to prevent or minimize adverse effects from the proposed
administrative adjustment.
5. Recording. The City Planner may require the applicant to record the
administrative adjustment with the County Register of Deeds. The
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-27
administrative adjustment shall be binding upon the landowners,
their successors and assigns.
6. Subsequent Development. Development authorized by the
administrative adjustment shall not be carried out until the
applicant has secured all other permits required by this Ordinance or
any other applicable provisions of the City. An administrative
adjustment shall not ensure that the development approved as an
administrative adjustment shall receive subsequent approval for
other applications for development, unless the relevant and
applicable portions of this Ordinance or any other applicable
provisions are met.
7. Effect of Administrative Adjustment. Issuance of an administrative
adjustment shall authorize only the particular modification that is
approved in the administrative adjustment. An administrative
adjustment, including any conditions, shall run with the land and not
be affected by a change in ownership.
8. Expiration. Unless otherwise specified in the administrative
adjustment, an application for a construction permit shall be applied
for and approved within one year of the date of the approval of the
administrative adjustment, otherwise the administrative adjustment
shall become invalid. Permitted time frames do not change with
successive owners.
9. Extension. Upon written request, only one extension of time may be
granted by the City Planner for a period not to exceed six months for
good cause shown.
10. Amendment. An administrative adjustment may be amended,
extended or modified only in accordance with the procedures and
standards established for its original approval.
H. Site Plan.
1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to
establish procedures and standards for review and approval of
development to ensure full compliance with the site and
development standards of this Ordinance and other related City
ordinances and state and federal regulations. Specifically, these site
plan review procedures and standards are intended to:
a) Consultation and Cooperation. Foster consultation and
cooperation between property owners proposing to develop
land and the City.
b) Balance Property Rights and Community Goals. Balance rights
of the property owner with the development goals of the City
and the rights of adjacent landowners.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-28
c) Minimize Adverse Impacts on Investments of Surrounding
Landowners. Minimize adverse impacts of development on the
investments of surrounding landowners.
d) Minimize Impacts on Environment, Drainage, Soil Erosion, and
Stormwater Control. Ensure site design minimizes negative
impacts on the environment, drainage, soil erosion, and
stormwater control.
e) Development Consistent With Surrounding Character and Goals
of Comprehensive Plan. Ensure the arrangement, location and
design of development is consistent with the character of the
area and the goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
f) Minimize Impact on Roads. Ensure site design minimizes
negative impacts on roadway capacity, the safety of motorists
and pedestrians, utilities, and community facilities and services.
g) Safe and Efficient Circulation. Ensure safe and efficient
circulation for motorized and nonmotorized traffic and
pedestrians within and adjacent to sites.
h) Gradual Upgrade of Nonconforming Sites. Provide for the
gradual upgrade of existing sites that do not conform with
current standards.
i) Thorough Evaluation of Development. Ensure a thorough
evaluation of development in relation to the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan, with emphasis on preserving aesthetics,
the environment, historic resources, property values, quality of
life, and other public health, safety and welfare objectives.
2. Applicability. Unless exempted pursuant to § 8.3H.3: Exemptions,
prior to the development of any new use or structure, any change of
an existing use of land, the expansion or conversion of any use or
structure, or any other development activity, a site plan shall be
approved pursuant to the procedures and standards of this section.
Construction plans will not be reviewed or a construction permit
issued until a site plan is approved pursuant to the procedures and
standards of this section.
3. Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from the requirements
of this section:
a) One- or Two-Family Dwelling. The development or expansion of
a one-family or two-family dwelling unit.
b) Dwelling Unit in Mobile Home Park. Placement of a dwelling unit
in an approved mobile home park.
c) Internal Construction Not Increasing Intensity or Parking
Requirement. The internal construction or change in the floor
area of a structure that does not increase gross floor area,
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-29
increase the intensity of use or affect parking requirements on
a site that meets all development and site design standards of
this Ordinance.
d) Site Clearing Within Area Less Than 1/2 Acre. Grading,
excavation, filling, soil removal, creation of ponds or clearing of
trees within an area of less than 1/2 acre in size.
e) Temporary Uses. Temporary uses.
f) Minor Development or Expansion. Expansion or new structures
up to and including 250 square feet in area.
4. Overview. Development for which a site plan is required pursuant to
this section shall be subject to one of two processes: sketch plan
review or full site plan review.
a) Sketch Plan Review. Sketch plan review is required of smaller
sized development and development with potentially less
impacts. Except for development in the CBTR District, it
requires review and approval, approval with conditions or
disapproval by the Site Plan Review Committee (SPRC). Sketch
plan review in the CBTR District requires review and approval by
the SPRC and review and final action by the Planning
Commission.
b) Full Site Plan Review. Full site plan review is required of larger
sized development, and development with potentially greater
impacts. Except for development in the CBTR District, it
requires review and approval, approval with conditions or
disapproval of a preliminary site plan and then a final site plan
by the SPRC. Preliminary site plan and then final site plan review
in the CBTR District requires review and approval by the SPRC
and then review and final action by the Planning Commission.
The applicant may consolidate review of the preliminary site
plan and final site plan. The preliminary site plan presents the
proposed development concept with sufficient information to
enable the review board to determine whether the concept
complies with the review standards of this section. The final site
plan requires submission of detailed information about the
proposed development with exact dimensions, representing a
firm commitment about development of the site.
5. Threshold for Sketch Plan Review and Full Site Plan Review. The
thresholds for which type of development is subject to sketch plan
review or full site plan review are set forth in Table 8.3-2.

§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-34
Site Plan Review
d) Not Adversely Affect Development or Improvement of
Surrounding Property. The development proposed in the site
plan does not adversely affect the normal and orderly
development or improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in Table 4.1, Use Table.
e) Not Adversely Impact on Surrounding Land Uses and Zoning.
The development proposed in the site plan is harmonious with,
and not harmful or injurious to existing and planned future uses
in the immediate area. The proposed development will be
coordinated with improvements serving the subject property
and with the other developments in the vicinity.
f) Design and Development Standards in Historic Districts and
CCBI). The development proposed in a site plan located within
local historic districts, other historically designated areas or
within the CCBD district conforms to all applicable design and
development standards.
g) Preservation of Historic Resources. The site plan demonstrates
judicious effort to preserve and protect historic resources to the
greatest extent reasonable, and the site plan meets all federal,
state, and local regulations pertaining to historic resources.
h) Open Space. Open space is distributed and conveniently
located physically with respect to the overall development, will
be accessible to all residents of the development and is located
to meet the needs of the residents or occupants. Open space
shall be rationally coordinated with open space features of
adjacent areas and enhance the natural features of the site.
i) Preservation of Natural Features. The site plan demonstrates
judicious effort to preserve the integrity of the land, existing

compactors and individual recycle stations) proposed in the site
plan comply with all appropriate City regulations and are
screened pursuant to § 6.3D: Screening of Waste Receptacles.
t) Exterior Lighting. Exterior lighting proposed in the site plan
complies with § 6.6: Operational Performance Standards, and all
other applicable City regulations. Exterior lighting is arranged
so it is deflected away from adjacent properties and it does not
impede the vision of traffic along adjacent streets.
u) Signs. Signage proposed in the site plan complies with Chapter
7: Signs, and is generally complementary with surrounding
signage and does not impede adjacent traffic operations.
v) Storage of Potentially Hazardous Materials or Waste. Any uses
in the site plan utilizing storing or handling of hazardous
material provides secondary containment facilities and
documentation of compliance with all appropriate state and
federal regulations.
w) Utilities. The site plan provides adequate utility services. All new
utility distribution lines (public or private) shall be placed
underground, when feasible. Proposed utilities shall be
approved by the City Engineer.
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-37

comply with all other relevant standards of this Ordinance, and
is consistent with public health, safety, and welfare.
8. Conditions of Approval. The review body may, in approving the site
plan, impose such conditions on the approval and the premises to be
developed or used as is determined are required to ensure
compliance with the standards of this section. Performance
guarantees may be required to ensure completion of site
improvements pursuant to § 8.3.H.9: Performance Guarantees.
9. Performance Guarantees.
a) General. The review body may require a performance
guarantee to ensure completion of the site improvements
(excluding building) for the site plan. The performance
guarantee may take the form of a cash deposit, surety bond,
certified check, or an irrevocable bank letter of credit.
b) Determination of Amount, Deposit and Rebate. The amount of
the performance guarantee shall be determined by the City
Engineer and the City Planner. The applicant shall deposit the
performance guarantee with the City Treasurer prior to
application for a construction permit. If the required
improvements take longer than six months to complete, the
City Planner shall authorize a rebate of any cash deposit in
proportion to the amount of work that has been completed in
accordance with the approved sketch plan or final site plan.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-38
10. Record and Transmittal of Site Plan Approval. The grounds for the
action taken on each site plan application shall be recorded in
writing by the body taking final action on the site plan (sketch plan,
preliminary site plan or final site plan). A copy of an approved sketch
plan or final site plan shall be transmitted to the applicant, the City
Planner, the Community Development Division, the Engineering
Division and Public Safety by the Chairperson of the SPRC within two
weeks of the date of final approval by the review board.
11. Effect of Sketch Plan or Final Site Plan. Approval of a sketch plan or
final site plan, whichever is appropriate, authorizes the
development approved, subject to any conditions of approval. A
sketch plan or final site plan, including any conditions, shall run with
the land and not be affected by a change in ownership.
12. Expiration. Approval of a sketch plan or final site plan, whichever is
appropriate, shall become invalid at the end of one year after the
date of its issuance if a construction permit for at least one building
in the development proposed in the site plan is not approved.
Permitted time frames do not change with successive owners.
13. Extension. Upon written request, one extension of six months may
be granted by the body that approved the sketch plan or final site
plan for good cause shown if a request for an extension is submitted
prior to the expiration of the permit pursuant to § 8.3H.12:
Expiration.
14. Engineering Plans, Specifications, and Inspection. Subsequent to
sketch plan or final site plan approval, and before any construction
proceeds, complete engineering plans and specifications for
construction of storm sewers and drains, sanitary sewers, water

M. Beneficial Use Determination.
1. General. If after the submission and decision on the appropriate
applications for development approval or permits for a plan for the
development of land a landowner in the City is of the opinion that all
reasonable economically beneficial use of that landowner's land has
been denied by the application of this Ordinance, then the
procedures of this section shall be used prior to seeking relief from
the courts in order that any denial of economically beneficial use of
land may be remedied through a nonjudicial forum.
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-45
2. Purpose. The purpose and intent of the City Commission is that
every landowner in the City enjoys all reasonable economically
beneficial use of land. It is also the purpose and intent of this section
to provide for relief to the landowner, where appropriate, from the
application of this Ordinance. The procedures set forth in this
section are intended to permit landowners who believe they have
been deprived of all reasonable economically beneficial use of their
land to apply to the City Commission for relief sufficient to provide
an economically beneficial use of the land.
3. Procedure.
a) Application for an Appeal for Beneficial Use Determination. An
appeal for a beneficial use determination may be filed by a
landowner at any time with the City Planner, along with an
application fee established pursuant to § 8.1E: Fees.
Beneficial Use Determination

price of the land, and any offers to purchase the land made
by any person, corporation, or association, within the last
three years.
4) A description of the physical features present on the land,
the land's total acreage, the present use of the land, and
the use of the land at the time of the adoption of this
Ordinance.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-46
5) Evidence of any investments made by the landowner to
improve the land, the date the improvements were made,
and the costs of the improvements.
6) A description of what uses of land were available when the
land was purchased by the landowner.
7) A description of the regulations and uses permitted that are
alleged to result in an elimination of economically
beneficial use of the land.

and any actions taken by the City related to the land.
9) A description of the use that the landowner believes
represents the minimum legally required economically
beneficial use of the land and all documentation, studies,
and other supporting evidence for such opinion.
c) Determination of Sufficiency. The City Planner shall determine if
the application is sufficient and includes data in sufficient detail
to evaluate the application to determine if it complies with the
appropriate substantive requirements of this section.
1) If the City Planner determines the application is not
sufficient, a written notice shall be mailed to the applicant
specifying the application's deficiencies. No further action
shall be taken on the application until the deficiencies are
remedied. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiencies
within 30 days, the application shall be considered
withdrawn, and the application fee shall be refunded.
2) When the application is determined sufficient, the City
Planner shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the
application's sufficiency, and forward the application to the
Hearing Officer for the scheduling of a hearing.
d) Establishment of Date for Hearing by Hearing Officer and
Notice. Within 30 calendar days of the date that the application
has been determined sufficient by the City Planner, the Hearing
Officer shall schedule a hearing on the appeal for beneficial use
determination. The City Planner shall provide the applicant and
all landowners within 300 feet of the land subject to the appeal
for beneficial use determination at least 15 days notice of the
hearing by regular mail.
e) Hearing by Hearing Officer. At the hearing, the applicant or the
applicant's representative shall present the applicant's case
and the City Attorney shall represent the City. All evidence
presented shall be under oath, and the parties involved shall be
permitted to cross-examine witnesses. The sworn testimony
and evidence shall pertain to the standards set forth in
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-47
§ 8.3M.4: Beneficial Use Standards, as to whether the applicant
has been deprived of an economically beneficial use of the land
and the standards in § 8.3M.5: Granting of Relief, pertaining to
the degree of relief needed to provide the landowner with an
economically beneficial use of the land.
f) Findings of the Hearing Officer. Within 30 days of the close of
the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall prepare recommended
findings of fact and a proposed order for the consideration of
the City Commission. The findings and recommendations of the
Hearing Officer as to whether the land is provided economically
beneficial use shall be based on the evidence submitted and the
standards in § 8.3M.4: Beneficial Use Standards. If the Hearing
Officer finds that the applicant has been denied economically
beneficial use of the subject land, then the Hearing Officer shall
recommend a use that permits an economically beneficial use
and results in a minimum change from the regulations of this
Ordinance as they apply to the subject land, pursuant to the
standards set forth in § 8.3M.4: Beneficial Use Standards, and
§ 8.3M.5: Granting of Relief, or other relief as is determined
appropriate. The Hearing Officer's recommended findings of
facts and proposed order shall be in writing and shall detail the
basis of the conclusions from the record of the hearing.
g) Action by City Commission. The City Planner shall schedule a
hearing before the City Commission within 30 days of the date
the Hearing Officer issues the recommended findings of fact
and proposed order. The City Planner shall provide the applicant
and all landowners within 300 feet of the land subject to the
appeal for beneficial use determination at least 15 days notice
of the hearing by mail. At the hearing, the City Commission shall
approve the findings of fact and proposed order of the Hearing
Officer, or may attach conditions, modify, or reverse the
findings of fact or proposed order of the Hearing Officer, based
on the standards of § 8.3M.4: Beneficial Use Standards, and
§ 8.3M.5: Granting of Relief. If the City Commission attaches
conditions, modifies or reverses the findings of fact or proposed
order, it shall do so only where the record of the hearing
indicates that the Hearing Officer is unsupported by the record,
or that the proposed order is not in conformance with the
standards of § 8.3M.4: Beneficial Use Standards, and § 8.3M.5:
Granting of Relief.
4. Beneficial Use Standards. In determining if a landowner has been
deprived of an economically beneficial use of land, the Hearing
Officer and City Commission shall take into account the following
factors:
a) Economically Viable Use. In making the determination of
whether the land is provided an economically beneficial use, the
Hearing Officer/City Commission shall first evaluate the uses of
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-48
the land as provided by this Ordinance and the uses of land in
relation to the uses provided similarly situated lands. For the
purposes of this section, economically beneficial use means the
opportunity to make a return equivalent to that which would
have been received from a conservative financial investment.
Transitory economic issues shall not be relevant to this
determination.
b) Diminution in Value. The market value of the land, as
established by the comparable sales approach, prior to
adoption of this Ordinance, which caused the landowner to
apply for relief shall be compared to the market value of the
land, as established by the comparable sales approach, with the
regulations as applied. Market value of the land prior to the
adoption of this Ordinance shall constitute its highest and best
use on (one day prior to the effective of this Ordinance, as
amended) or the date of purchase of the land, whichever is
later, and any other land value/appraisal information that the
applicant would like to be considered. All appraisals shall be
proposed by qualified licensed appraisers, and shall follow the
best professional practices as established by the profession. A
mere diminution in market value is not sufficient to support a
determination of denial of economically beneficial use.
c) External Costs.
1) The amount or nature of any subsidy that may be required
by the City, neighbors, purchasers, tenants, or the publicat-
large if the uses allowed under this Ordinance are
modified; or
2) Any other adverse effects on the City and its residents.
d) Current State of the Law. The state of the law established by the
United States Supreme Court, the federal Circuit Courts of
Appeals, and the Michigan Supreme Court, relevant to these
standards.
5. Granting of Relief.
a) Relief. If the finding is that a landowner has been deprived
economically beneficial use of land, or is otherwise entitled to
relief pursuant to the standards of this section, relief shall be
granted.
b) General. In granting relief, the Hearing Officer may recommend
and the City Commission may adopt any legally available
incentive or measure reasonably necessary to offset any
substantial economic hardship, and may condition such
incentives upon approval of specific development plans. If there
is a finding that the denial of the application would create a
substantial economic hardship, the Hearing Officer may
§ 8.3 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 8.3
46:8-49
recommend and the City Commission may consider additional
relief to provide an appropriate increase in market value or
other benefit or return to the applicant sufficient to offset the
substantial economic hardship. The types of incentives that the
Hearing Officer may recommend and the City Commission may
consider includes, but are not limited to, the following:
1) An amendment of the Zone District Map (rezoning of
property) to a more appropriate classification, issuance of a
variance, approval of a site plan, or other appropriate land
use regulatory action that will enable the applicant to
realize a reasonable return on the property;
2) An opportunity to transfer density or cluster development
on other property;
3) A waiver of permit fees;
4) Development finance assistance;
5) Approval of development on some portion of the property;
or
6) Acquisition of all or a portion of the property at market
value.
c) Minimum Increase. In granting relief, the landowner shall be
given the minimum increase in use density/intensity or other
possible concessions from this Ordinance in order to permit an
economically viable use of the land or a use that is determined
to be required by law. The highest use, or even an average or
generally reasonable expectation, is not required or intended as
the appropriate remedy. The following guidelines shall be used
for determining the minimum economically beneficial use of
land and, therefore, the amount of relief to be granted a
landowner in order to reach that minimum.
1) A minimum economically beneficial use of the land should
be one that does not have any governmental subsidy
attached to the long term safe occupation of the land. If
such a subsidy is needed, then that should be reflected by
lowering the use intensity that is considered a minimum
economically viable use on a market valuation basis.
2) A use common to the City, although it may not involve
further development of the land, is considered an
economically viable use. Attention shall also be given to
land uses that are considered to be the lowest intensity in
the City but which uses still provide for occupation and
living within the City. These land uses, as well, shall be
considered economically viable uses.
§ 8.3 KALAMAZOO CODE § 8.3
46:8-50
3) The actual condition of the land shall be considered. The
reality of limited development potential, given the natural
condition of the land, shall not be attributed to the
regulations applied to the land. If the land is such that it
cannot safely accommodate development with normal
grading and clearing practices, this fact shall lower the
intensity of use that is considered a minimum economically
viable use.
4) The potential for damages to either residents or land shall
be assessed in determining economically viable use. The
need for a governmental subsidy to future landowners shall
be considered, and the cost of such subsidies shall be
deducted from the otherwise established minimum
economically viable use.
5) Expectations shall, in general, not be considered. Only
reasonable expectations backed by investments as
required by the current state of the law, shall be
considered.
6) The current state of law established by the United States
Supreme Court, the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, and
the Michigan Supreme Court, relevant to the granting of
relief.
6. Appeal. The decision of the City Commission may be appealed to a
court of law.

46:8-51

CHAPTER 9
Nonconformities
§ 9.1. General.
§ 9.2. Nonconforming Uses.
Nonconforming uses are those uses that were legally established but no
longer comply with the use regulations of the zone district in which they are
located.
A. Purpose and Scope. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to establish
regulations governing uses, structures, signs and lots that were lawfully
established prior to this Ordinance but do not conform to one or more
existing requirements of this Ordinance. The intent of this Ordinance is
to regulate and limit these nonconformities until they are removed.
B. Authority to Continue. Nonconforming uses, structures, signs and lots
that legally existed on October 18, 2005, or that become nonconforming
upon the adoption of any amendment to this Ordinance may be
continued only in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Unless
otherwise expressly stated, any variation from these standards shall
require review and approval of a variance, in accordance with the
procedures and standards of § 8.3E: Variances.
C. Determination of Nonconformity Status. The burden of establishing that
any nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall in all cases be upon the
owner of the nonconformity.
D. Repairs and Maintenance. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of
nonconformities shall be permitted unless such repairs increase the
extent of nonconformity or are otherwise expressly prohibited by this
Ordinance. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent
structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe
condition, in accordance with an official order of a public official.
E. Change of Tenancy or Ownership. The status of nonconformity is not
affected by changes of tenancy, ownership or management.
A. Enlargement or Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or
expanded in area, except that a nonconforming use may be enlarged in
any area of the same structure that was manifestly designed for such
use prior to the date the use became a nonconformity. The structure
shall not be physically enlarged to accommodate a nonconforming use.
B. Relocation. A nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole, or in part,
to another location on the parcel of land on which it is located, unless the
relocation of the nonconforming use decreases the nonconformity.
C. Damage and Restoration of Structure Containing a Nonconforming Use.
If a conforming structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged by
any means to the extent of more than 50% of its actual cash value at the
§ 9.1 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 9.2
46:9-1
time damage occurs as determined by the City Assessor, the
nonconforming use shall not be reestablished except in compliance with
all regulations applicable to the zone district in which it is located. Any
conforming structure that is damaged by any means to a lesser extent
may continue the nonconforming use if it is reconstructed and used as
before within one year of the damage.
D. Change to Conforming Use. A nonconforming use may be changed to
any use that is permitted in the zone district in which it is located,
subject to the standards and requirements applicable to the new use.
E. Conversion of Conforming Use. Once a nonconforming use is converted
to a conforming use it may not be changed back to a nonconforming use.
F. Change to Other Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may be
changed to another nonconforming use only if reviewed and approved
by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may
approve such change of nonconforming use only if it determines that the
new nonconforming use will not be more injurious to the surrounding
area than the previous nonconforming use. If a change in use is
approved, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be authorized to impose
conditions it deems necessary to reduce or minimize any potentially
adverse effect upon other property in the neighborhood, and to carry out
the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance. Any condition imposed
shall relate to a situation created or aggravated by the proposed use and
must be roughly proportional to its impact.
G. Loss of Nonconforming Status.
1. Abandonment. Once abandoned, a nonconforming use shall not be
reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the
structure or open land must comply with the regulations of the zone
district in which it is located and all other applicable requirements of
this Ordinance.
2. Evidence of Abandonment. A nonconforming use shall be presumed
abandoned and its rights as a nonconforming use extinguished
when any one of the following has occurred:

statement indicated intent to abandon the use.
b) Conforming use. A conforming use has replaced the
nonconforming use.

but no longer comply with the intensity and dimensional standards of the
zone district in which they are located.
change in use or activity to something other than the
nonconforming use.
e) Use discontinued or inactive for one year. The use has been
discontinued, vacant or inactive for a continuous period of at
least one year, regardless of ownership.
3. Overcoming Presumption of Abandonment. A presumption of
abandonment based on the evidence of abandonment stated in
§ 9.2G.2: Evidence of Abandonment, may be rebutted upon a
showing that the owner:
a) Conforms with relevant regulations. Has been maintaining the
land and structure in accordance with all applicable regulations,
including the Building Code, and did not intend to discontinue
the use.
b) No intent of abandonment. Has been engaged in other activities
that would affirmatively prove there was not intent to abandon.
c) Licenses. Has been maintaining all applicable licenses.
d) Tax documents. Has filed all applicable tax documents.
A. Use. A nonconforming structure may be used for any use allowed in the
underlying zone district, subject to all applicable use standards.
B. Expansion. A nonconforming structure may be enlarged or expanded
only if the expansion does not increase the extent of nonconformity.
C. Moving. A nonconforming structure may be moved if the movement or
relocation eliminates the nonconformity.
D. Loss of Nonconforming Status; Damage or Destruction.
1. Principal Structures. Except for single-family dwellings existing on
October 18, 2005, any nonconforming principal structure that is
destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50% of its actual
cash value at the time damage occurs as determined by the City
Assessor, shall not be reestablished except in compliance with all
regulations applicable to the zone district in which it is located. Any
nonconforming structure that is damaged to a lesser extent may
continue if repairs or reconstruction is undertaken within one year of
the date of the partial destruction and diligently carried on to its
completion.
§ 9.2 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 9.3
46:9-3
§ 9.4. Nonconforming Lots. [Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
Nonconforming lots are those lots that were legally established, such as lots
of record, but no longer comply with the minimum area or width standards of
the zone district in which they are located.
2. Accessory Structures. Except for an accessory structure to a singlefamily
dwelling existing on October 18, 2005, no nonconforming
structure that is accessory to a principal structure shall continue
after such accessory structure has been destroyed by more than
50% of its actual cash value at the time damage occurs as
determined by the City Assessor, unless the accessory structure
complies with all applicable regulations of this Ordinance. In the RD
zones, nonconforming residential dwellings containing two units can
be rebuilt, regardless of the extent of the damage, if: a) the
rebuilding does not increase the nonconformity, and b) if any of the
units are renter-occupied, a valid Certificate of Compliance issued
by the City was in effect at the time of the damage. If these two
conditions are not met, the dwelling can only be rebuilt in
compliance with all regulations applicable to the zone district. In the
RM zones, nonconforming residential dwellings containing two to
four units can be rebuilt, regardless of the extent of the damage, if:
a) the rebuilding does not increase the nonconformity, and b) if any
of the units are renter-occupied, a valid Certificate of Compliance
issued by the City was in effect at the time of the damage. If these
two conditions are not met, the dwelling can only be rebuilt in
compliance with all regulations applicable to the zone district. Any
nonconforming accessory structure that is damaged to a lesser
extent may continue if repairs or reconstruction is undertaken within
one year of the date of the partial destruction and diligently carried
on to its completion. [Amended 3-19-2007 by Ord. No. 1822]
A. Vacant Lots. If the nonconforming lot was vacant at the time it became
legally nonconforming, it may be used for any use allowed in the
underlying zone district. If one or more uses or intensities would comply
with applicable setback requirements of the underlying zone district
while others would not, then only the uses or intensities that would
conform to applicable setback requirements shall be permitted.
Development on nonconforming lots shall comply with the dimensional
standards of the underlying zone district, except as expressly stated in
this section.
B. Developed Lots. If the nonconforming lot contained a building or
structure at the time it became nonconforming, then the building or
structure may be maintained or expanded in accordance with the
standards of § 9.3: Nonconforming Structures.
C. Nonconformities Created by Government Action.
1. General Provision. When the Michigan Department of
Transportation, the Kalamazoo County Road Commission, the City of

§ 9.5. Nonconforming Signs.
A nonconforming sign is a sign that exceeds the surface and/or height
limitations of Chapter 7: Signs, is a type of sign that is not permitted, or is
placed in a location that is not permitted by this Ordinance.
Kalamazoo, or any other governmental entity acquires additional
right-of-way for the purpose of street construction, street relocation,
street widening, or utilities, and the result of such acquisition is
to create a nonconformity with the minimum setback, lot width,
lot area, parking requirements, or any other requirement of this
Ordinance, any existing lot, building, or structure rendered
nonconforming by such action shall thereafter be permitted to be
altered, enlarged, or rebuilt as set forth in Subsection 2 below. This
provision shall apply regardless of whether the additional right-ofway
was acquired through the exercise of eminent domain powers,
or by transfer under the threat of eminent domain proceedings.
2. Limitations. Any alteration, enlargement, or rebuilding of a lot,
building, or structure affected by government action as described in
Subsection 1 above, shall be limited to actions that do not increase
its nonconformity. As an example, a structure would be permitted to
be altered, enlarged, or rebuilt provided that such action would not
further reduce the setback distance to the front property line or
further reduce the number of permissible parking spaces. In
addition, any alteration, enlargement, or rebuilding shall comply
with the following provisions.
a) Damages minimized. If the condemnation action has not been
decided by a court of law, the amount of severance and
business damages resulting from the eminent domain
proceedings are substantial, and the loss of business damages
would be minimized by a determination for conformity;
b) Site plan. A site plan can be designed for the land that is
consistent with the use requirements of this Ordinance, and
minimizes to the greatest degree practicable any
nonconformities of parking, loading, landscaping, lot size, and
yard requirements; and
c) Nonconformities minimized. The structure or lot can function
adequately for its designated land use pursuant to a proposed
site plan that minimizes nonconformities while ensuring
compatibility.
A. Continuation of Nonconforming Signs. A nonconforming sign shall not:
1. Be changed to another nonconforming sign.
2. Be structurally altered or changed in shape, size, location or design,
except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this
Ordinance.
§ 9.4 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 9.5
46:9-5
3. Have any change made in the words or symbols used or the
message displayed on the sign.
4. Be structurally altered so as to prolong the life of the sign or change
the shape, size, type or design of the sign.
5. Be re-established after the business, service, or activity to which it
relates is discontinued for 30 days or longer (and the nonconforming
sign and all supporting structures shall be removed).
6. Be re-established after damage caused by accident, natural causes,
or vandalism, if the damage is in excess of 50% of its actual cash
value at the time damage occurs as determined by the City
Assessor.
B. Normal Maintenance of Nonconforming Signs. Subject to the other
provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may have normal
maintenance performed.
C. Change to Face of Nonconforming Sign. The owner of a nonconforming
sign may change the face of a nonconforming sign if the owner enters
into an agreement with the City that complies with the following
requirements. For the purposes of this subsection, the "face of a
nonconforming sign" is defined as the area of the sign that displays the
name, identification, description, illustration, business or solicitation (it
does not include any portion of the structural support of the sign or
changeable copy area):
1. Removal of sign within five years. That states that in exchange for
the opportunity to change the face of the sign, the entire
nonconforming sign, which includes the face and structure, shall be
removed within five years of entering into the agreement.
2. Owner(s) pay for removal. The owner of the sign and/or the owner of
the land on which the sign is located will pay for removal of the sign.
3. No variance. The owner of the sign and the owner of the land on
which the sign is located waives the right to request a variance from
the Zoning Board of Appeals so that the sign can remain after five
years.
4. Agreement runs with land. The agreement shall run with the land
and become binding on any subsequent owners of the sign or
owners of the land on which the sign is located.
5. Future sign comply with this Ordinance Any future sign constructed
to replace the sign (if it is appropriate), shall comply with the
requirements of Chapter 7: Signs
6. Recording. The agreement shall be recorded with the Register of
Deeds by the owner of the sign within 30 days of the execution of
the agreement, or the agreement shall be null and void.

46:9-6
§ 9.6. Elimination of Nonconforming Use by City.
Pursuant to Public Act 207 of 1921 (MCLA § 125.583a, as amended), the City
Commission may, from to time, acquire properties on which nonconforming
uses or structures are located, by condemnation or otherwise, and may
remove such uses or structures and lease or sell the property for a
conforming use or develop it for a public use, other than public housing. The
net cost of such acquisition may be assessed against a benefit district or may
be paid from other sources of revenue.
7. Lien. A lien in the amount of 150% of the estimated cost of removing
the sign shall be placed against the land on which the sign is located
and any structure on the land on which the sign is located five years
from the date of the execution of the agreement, and shall remain
effective until the sign is removed.

Mayor, with the approval of a majority vote of the City Commission.
The individuals currently serving as members of the Commission

This Ordinance shall be known as the "Land Subdivision Standards
Ordinance" of the City of Kalamazoo, Michigan.
§ 1.20. Purpose.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish procedures and standards
for the development and subdivision of land and the platting thereof to
provide for efficient, adequate and sufficient streets with adequate widths
and proper alignment and grades designed to promote the public safety,
health and general welfare, to provide for suitable residential neighborhoods
with adequate streets and utilities and appropriate building sites, to save
unnecessary expenditures of public funds by reserving space for public
lands and buildings and proper construction of streets and utilities, and to
provide proper land records for the convenience of the public and for better

Definitions
§ 2.10. Subdivision. [Amended 6-23-1969 by Ord. No. 830]
The term "subdivision" means the division of a parcel of land into five or
more lots or parcels for the purpose of transfer of ownership or building
development; provided, that a division of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of 10 acres or more shall not be deemed a subdivision.
§ 2.20. Plat.
A "plat" means the final map, drawing, or chart on which the subdivider's
plan of subdivision is presented to the Planning Commission for approval.
(Chapter VI contains the detailed plat data.)
§ 2.30. Street.
The term "street" means a way for vehicular traffic, whether designated as
a street, highway, thorofare, park-way, road, avenue, boulevard, land, place,
or however otherwise designated.

for fast and heavy traffic (designated as interregional and regional
thorofares on the Major Thorofare Plan).
§ 2.32 "Collector streets" are those which carry traffic from minor streets to
the major system of arterial streets and highways, including the principal

CHAPTER III
Procedure
§ 3.00. Pre-Application Procedure (Step One).
§ 3.10. Procedure for Conditional Approval of Preliminary plat (Step
Two).
§ 3.01 Previous to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the
preliminary plat the subdivider shall submit to the City Planning Director
plans and data as specified in Chapter VI, § 6.00. The Planning Director
will act as a clearinghouse and forward the information to all concerned
departments for their recommendations.
§ 3.02Within 15 days, the City Planning Director shall inform the subdivider
in writing that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do
not meet the objectives of these regulations. When the City Planning
Director finds the plans and data do not meet the objectives of these
regulations he/she shall express the reasons therefor in writing. No
commitments can be made by the City Planning Director at this stage as
to the official acceptance of the preliminary plat. Appeal from the
findings of the Planning Director may be made to the City Planning
Commission.
§ 3.11 On reaching conclusions informally, as recommended in § 3.00 above,
regarding his general program and objectives the subdivider shall cause
to be prepared by a registered professional engineer or surveyor a
preliminary plat, together with improvement plans and other
supplementary material as specified in Chapter VI.
§ 3.12 Five copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material shall
be submitted to the Planning Department with written application for
conditional approval at least two weeks prior to the meeting of the
Planning Commission at which it is to be considered.
§ 3.13 The preliminary plat will be checked by the Planning Department as to
its conformity with the Major Street Plan, Land Use Plan and the
principles, standards and requirements hereinafter set forth. Copies of
said preliminary plat will be referred by the Planning Department to the
City Engineer, the Traffic Engineer, the Utilities Director, the Health
Officer and the public utility companies involved for study and
recommendation on items within their jurisdiction. Said
recommendations shall be made in writing within two weeks.
§ 3.14 On the basis of the recommendations of the appropriate departments
and its own investigations, the Planning Commission shall determine
whether the lands are suitable for platting purposes. Lands subject to
flood or deemed to be topographically unsuitable because of relief,
drainage, soil character or other conditions shall not be platted for
residential purposes nor for such other uses as may increase danger to
health, life or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard.
§ 3.00 REGULATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED § 3.10
46:III-1
§ 3.20. Procedure for Approval of Final Plat (Step Three).
§ 3.15 The Planning Commission shall, within 40 days of its first meeting after
receiving the Plat, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary
plat, or approve it with modifications, noting thereon any changes that
will be required. If the preliminary plat be disapproved, the reasons
therefor shall be presented in writing to the subdivider. The action of the
Planning Commission shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary
plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One copy
shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the
Planning Commission. Similar copies will be transmitted to the City
Engineer, the Traffic Engineer, and where appropriate, to the Utilities
Director and the Health Officer. Appeal from the action of the Planning
Commission may be made to the City Commission.
§ 3.16 Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval
of the final subdivision plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of
approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to
the installation of streets, sewers and other required improvements and
the preparation of the final plat. Conditional approval is effective for one
year unless extended by the Planning Commission.
§ 3.21 The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which he/she proposes to record
and develop at the time; provided, however that such conforms to all
requirements of these regulations.
§ 3.22 Application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted in writing to
the Planning Department at least two weeks prior to the meeting of the
Planning Commission at which it is to be considered. The application
shall be accompanied by a fee of $60 to be deposited with the City
Treasurer by the subdivider to provide for the expense of inspections of
lands, checking of the plat and fees required to be paid under the State
Plat Act.
§ 3.23 Five litho prints on cloth of the final plat and other exhibits required for
approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission within one year
after approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise such approval shall
become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and
granted by the Planning Commission.
§ 3.24 The final plat will be checked by the Planning Department for
compliance with the formal provisions of these regulations. Copies of the
final plat will be referred by the Planning Department to the City
Engineer, the Traffic Engineer, the Utilities Director, the Health Officer
and the public utility companies involved for their final study and
recommendations on matters within their jurisdiction.
§ 3.25 The above mentioned officials will, within two weeks, return the said
copies of the final plat together with a two-fold certificate showing (a)
§ 3.10 KALAMAZOO CODE § 3.20
46:III-2
the technical details within their jurisdiction have been checked and
found satisfactory, and (b) all required improvements within their
jurisdiction have been completed to their satisfaction or that a surety
bond has been posted with the City of Kalamazoo to insure to the City
that the improvements will be completed within two years after approval
of the final plat.
§ 3.26 After the foregoing recommendations and certificates have been
received, and provided that the final plat is found to conform with the
preliminary plat as tentatively approved and the requirements of the
State Plat Act, the Planning Commission will, within 40 days of its first
meeting after receiving the final plat, enter such approval thereon in
writing by the Planning Director. The approval of the final plat by the
Planning Commission shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an
acceptance by the public of the dedication of any street or other
proposed public way or space shown on said plat.
§ 3.27 After approval by the Planning Commission said Commission will
deliver the five copies of the final plat along with certification of title,
consisting of either an attorney's opinion or title insurance, to the City
Commission for approval and necessary action on any proposed
dedications. If the City Commission shall approve the final plat, it shall
cause to be transcribed upon the plat its certificate of approval. Action
by the City Commission to approve or disapprove the final plat shall be
taken within 14 days after the action of the City Planning Commission.
§ 3.28 The City Clerk shall deliver the five copies of the final plat together
with a fee of $10 to the Kalamazoo County Plat Board. When said Plat
Board has approved the final plat, the Board will endorse its approval
thereon and will forward the five copies to the office of the Auditor
General with a fee of $10. If and when the final plat has been approved
by the Auditor General, and copies are returned by him/her to the
County Register of Deeds and to the City Clerk, the subdivision will be
recorded as a plat of record.

Design Standards
§ 4.00. Streets.
§ 4.01 The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to the City of Kalamazoo Major Thorofare Plan and
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets.
§ 4.02 Where such is not shown in the Thorofare Plan, the arrangement of
streets in the subdivision shall either:
(1) Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas, or
(2) Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning Commission.
§ 4.03 Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
§ 4.04 Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service
alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection to residential properties and to afford separation of through
and local traffic.
§ 4.05 Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such rightof-
way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening
land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or
industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades

adjacent to a tract to be subdivided the other half of the street shall be
platted within such tract.
§ 4.14 Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not generally
be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a
turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and
a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet.

obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the name of the
existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the
Planning Commission.

provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of such width as may
be reasonably necessary for the utility or utilities to be benefited.
§ 4.32 Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or
drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse, and such additional width as will be adequate for the
purpose.
§ 4.41 The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to:
(1) Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of
the type of use contemplated.
