This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Maplewood, Missouri.

Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through June 12, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.

The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.

Chapter and Section Numbering System

The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of c h a p t e r 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of c h a p t e r 6 is 6 - 1 . Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6 - 1 and 6 - 2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-
1.5.	New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.

Page Numbering System

The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion  of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
 

The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.

Looseleaf Supplements

A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be
distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.

Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Acknowledgments

This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Howard George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

(b)
 
Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses of the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of St. Louis County v. BAP, Inc., 18 SW3d. 397 (Mo. App. E.D. 2000), City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. 475 U.S. 4 1 , 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 2 9 (1986), Young v.

Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this article as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.

Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.

Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndro human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States.
Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test. The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen.
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level.

In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drub abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those facilities.

Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (14) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.

Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
Removal of doors to adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article.
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

ARTICLE IX. - SOIL EXCAVATION AND EROSION CONTROL



Sec. 12-325. - Purpose.

 
(a)






(b)
 
The purpose of this article is to control soil erosion on land that is undergoing development for nonagricultural uses and to preserve the natural terrain and waterways of land within the city. The provisions in this article are intended to provide a natural community environment and to prevent soil erosion which makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed-out fill, roads and embankments. The resulting sediment of soil erosion clogs storm sewers, road ditches and chokes streams and creates silt lakes, all of which pose a threat to public health and safety. Interpretation and application of the provisions of this article shall be pursuant to these purposes.
This article supplements the demolition, street, sidewalk, excavation and subdivision provisions of the city, and does not alter the requirements of those provisions except as specifically provided herein. Should this article conflict with those provisions or other ordinances of the city, the more restrictive provision shall govern.

Sec. 22-42. - Statutory authorization, fndings of fact, and purposes.

 
(a)



(b)
 
Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo 89.020 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the city council of the City of Maplewood, Missouri ordains as follows:
Findings of fact.
 

(1)





(2)



(3)
 

Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Maplewood, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps.
 
a.	Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the
 

general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for St. Louis County dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
b.	Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
c.	Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point.

d.	Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.

e.	Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
 

(c)
 

Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in subsection (b)(1) of this section; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 4 4 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a) (3); and to meet the requirements of 4 4 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this article to:
 
(1)


(2)


(3)
 
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

Lands to which ordinance applies. This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Maplewood, Missouri identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) for St. Louis County on map panels, 29189C0327K and 29189C0331K dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in.
Floodplain administrator. The director of public works or his designated representative is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this article.
Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Interpretation . In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man- made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Maplewood, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected thereby.

(a)
 
General standards.
 

(1)



(2)





(3)





(4)
 

No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial-improvements, and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes, within any numbered or unnumbered A zones and AE zones, unless the conditions of this section are satisfied.
All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this article. If flood insurance study data is not available, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources.
Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within any numbered A zone or AE zone on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial-improvements, prefabricated structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require:
 
a.	Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
b.	Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;

c.	Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood damages;

d.	All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other service facilities be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
 

e.	New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood wat and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamin
f.	Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, located within special flood hazard areas are required to assure that:
1.	All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

2.	All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;
3.	Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and

4.	All proposals for development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, of five acres or 50 lots, whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data.
 
(5)
 
Storage, material, and equipment.
 

a.	The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
b.	Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning.
 
(6)
 
Accessory structures. Structures used solely for parking and limited storage purposes, not attached to any other structure on the site, of limited investment value, and not larger than 400 square feet, may be constructed at-grade and wet floodproofed provided there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; a variance has been granted from the standard floodplain management requirements of this article; and a floodplain development permit has been issued.

Specific standards. In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in subsection (a)(2), the following provisions are required:
 
(1)
 
Residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above base flood elevation.
 
(*In all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones, the FEMA, Region VII office recommends elevating to one foot above the base flood elevation to accommodate floodway conditions when the floodplain is fully developed.)
 

(2)
 

Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in s e c t i o n 2 2 - 4 4 (c)(9).
 

(*The FEMA, Region VII office recommends elevating to one foot above the base flood elevation to qualify for flood insurance rates based upon floodproofing.)
 

(3)
 

Require, for all new construction and substantial-improvements that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
 
a.	A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and

(1)





(2)
 

All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM on sites:
 
a.	Outside of manufactured home park or subdivision;

b.	In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

c.	In an expansion to and existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
 

d.	In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial-damage as the result of a a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation and to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
 
(3)
 
Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (c)(2) of this section, be elevated so that either:
 
a.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one foot above the base flood level; or

b.	The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

(d)
 

Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in s e c t i o n 2 2 - 4 3 (a) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
 
(1)



(2)





(3)


(4)
 
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial- improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
If subsection(d)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as set forth in subsection (a)(2).

(2)



(3)

(4)


(5)





(6)
 

Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory of historic places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.

Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.
 
(f)
 
Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures. Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this article. In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.

(6)

(7)


(8)





(9)
 
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in flood-prone areas only.

For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below highest adjacent grade, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with s e c t i o n 2 2 - 4 5 (a)(4)b. of this article.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with s e c t i o n 2 2 - 4 5 (a)(4)a. of this article. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific  flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above highest adjacent grade or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with s e c t i o n 
 2 2 - 4 5 (a)(4)d. of this article.

The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with the NFIP regulations.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.

No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below highest adjacent grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for
$100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below highest adjacent grade increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

No person shall operate or permit to be operated any stationary noise source which emits noise in such a manner that the level of the noise emitted, when measured at any point outside the boundary of the property upon which the stationary noise source is located using the slow meter characteristic and the A-weighting network of the sound level meter, exceeds the levels set forth in Table 1 below or exceeds the limit set forth in subsection (f) of this section. When the noise emitted is measured upon property that is located in a different land use category than the property upon which the stationary noise source is located, the levels applicable to the property where the noise emitted is measured shall be used to determine if a violation exists. If more than one use exists on the property where the noise emitted is measured such that more than one land use category would be applicable to the property, then the levels set forth in the least restrictive applicable land use category of Table I shall be used to determine if a violation exists.
If the stationary noise source emits noise containing discrete tone, the permissible levels shall be five dB lower than the applicable levels of Table I.
If the stationary noise source emits impulsive noise the levels of Table I shall be lowered by five dB. A violation of this article shall exist if the level of the impulsive noise emitted exceeds the applicable levels of Table I, as modified by this subsection, when the measurement is made using the fast meter characteristics and the A-weighting network of the sound level meter or if the level of the impulsive noise emitted exceeds the limit set forth in subsection (f) of this section.
In the event the stationary noise source emits impulsive noise containing a discrete tone, the modifications of Table I set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be cumulative.
If the ambient noise level exceeds the level of the noise emitted from the stationary noise source for one or more periods of time during the period measurement, then for any such period of time the level of the noise emitted from the stationary noise source shall be deemed to be lower than the level which is permitted for 60 minutes during the period of measurement in the applicable land use category and for the applicable time of day.
If, during the period of measurement, noise shall be emitted from a stationary noise source for periods of time at two or more different levels, a violation of this shall exist if the sum of the following fractions C1/T1 + C2/T2 +  + Cn/Tn exceeds the unit number 1. For purposes of this calculation Cn shall equal the actual time period that noise is emitted at each measured noise level and Tn shall equal the period of time that is permitted under Table I to be emitted at each measured noise level. Provided, however, if:
 
(1)


(2)
 
The ambient noise level exceeds the level of noise emitted from the stationary noise source for one or more periods of time during the period of measurement; or
The level of the noise emitted from the stationary noise source is lower than the level of noise which is permitted in Table I for 60 minutes
 

during the period of measurement in the applicable land use category and for the applicable time of day for one or more periods of time during the period of measurement;
then, for the purpose of the calculation set forth in this subsection, for each such period of time, the term Cn shall be deemed to be zero (0) and the fraction Cn/Tn shall be zero (0).

Sec. 34-242. - Abatement procedures.

Nuisances shall be abated as follows:

 
(1)





(2)
 
In cases in which an immediate threat to the public health, welfare or safety is apparent, the city manager may abate or cause the abatement of the nuisance, without notice, by any suitable means. The costs of the abatement shall be certified by the city manager to the city council that may, by ordinance, levy the cost of the abatement as a special tax against the property on which the nuisance was located. Such tax shall be collected as other city taxes are collected and shall be a first lien on the property against which it is assessed until it is paid.
In all other cases, the city manager or his designee shall hold a hearing determine whether a nuisance exists and whether and how it should be abated.
 
a.	At least five days' notice shall be given of such hearing to the owner and occupant of the premises upon which the alleged nuisance exists, or to such person's agent, and to the person causing or maintaining the alleged nuisance if other than the owner or occupant and if such person can be found. Such notices shall be given in writing and delivered in person to the party's residence or place of business.
b.	All interested parties may appear at the hearing and testify and present evidence concerning the alleged nuisance.

c.	In determining whether the activity or conditions constitute a nuisance, the city manager or his designee shall consider the following factors:
1.	The magnitude of the harm caused by the alleged detrimental activity or conditions;
 

2.	The length of time that the alleged detrimental activity or conditions have existed;

3.	The effect of the activity or conditions at the property on the value of adjacent properties and those in the surrounding area;

4.	The number of times that public safety officers have been dispatched to the property; and

5.	The extent of efforts by the owner or person having charge of the property to remedy the alleged detrimental activity or conditions.
d.	If, after the hearing, it is found that a nuisance exists and that it must be abated, the city manager or his designee may order the owner or occupant of the premises on which the nuisance exists or the person other than the owner or occupant who caused or maintains  the nuisance, to abate the nuisance within a prescribed period of time, or abate it by other means.
e.	The city manager or his designee shall effect the abatement of the nuisance by any measures necessary to cause its cessation and the prevention of its recurrence, including the ordering of revocation of occupancy permits for the persons residing at the dwelling or place of business where the nuisance has occurred and the denial of occupancy permits within the city to those persons for a period not to exceed six months, or the closure of the premise where the nuisance has occurred for a period not to exceed six months.
f.	The city manager or his designee shall levy a tax for the costs of the abatement incurred by the city under the provisions of subsection
(1) of this section.

g.	Any person adversely affected by the abatement order shall have a right of judicial review as provided by RSMo 536.100.

h.	If the revocation of occupancy permits or the closure of the property is ordered, the city manager shall direct the chief of police to set a time period within which the property shall be vacated. The owner of the property, person in charge of the property and the occupant shall be notified to vacate the premises within the time period ordered by the chief of police. It shall become the duty upon such notice of both the owner and the occupant of such premises to comply by vacating the premises within the time period ordered by the chief of police. It shall be considered a violation of this Code if such premises are not vacated within the time period ordered by the chief of police. The chief of police is authorized to remove persons from the premises that have not been vacated within the time period ordered. The chief of police shall have the premises secured to prevent unlawful entry.
i.	Failure to comply with the lawful order of the city manager or his designee under the provision of this section shall be sufficient to subject a person to the penalties prescribed for violations of a provision of this Code.

(5)
 
No person shall deny entry to any person authorized to abate a nuisance to the property on which the nuisance to be abated exists, nor shall any person interfere with or hinder in any way the efforts of such authorized person or persons to abate the nuisance.
In any case, the city manager may authorize the city attorney to file suit against the owner or occupant of the property on which the nuisance exists, or the person other than the owner or occupant who caused or maintains the nuisance, to abate that nuisance.
In case of the abatement of a nuisance on the property of more than one person, all special taxes assessed under the provisions of this chapter shall be assessed in proportion to the amount of work and expense for the abatement of the nuisance for each separate parcel.

Such costs and expenses may be collected in any manner allowed by law, and shall be subject to a delinquent penalty of 15 percent in the event the same is not paid in full on or before the date the tax bill upon which such charges appears becomes delinquent, or in the case of the owner of property exempt from real estate taxes, three months after the date the bill for such work was mailed by regular mail addressed to the owner thereof at his last known address as furnished to or by the city. A copy of the verified statement recorded in accordance with these provisions, and certified as a true and complete copy by the recorder of deeds of the county, or his successor, or the recorded verified statement itself, shall be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done properly and satisfactorily, and shall be full notice to every person concerned that the amount of the statement, plus interest and appropriate costs and penalties, constitutes a charge against the property designated or described in the statement, and that the same is due and collectible as provided by law.

(a)







(b)
 
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in this chapter would result in real difficulties and substantial hardships or injustices, the commission may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider is allowed to develop his property in a reasonable manner, but so that, at the same time, the public welfare and interest of the city are protected and the general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved; provided that where construction standards or requirements are to be varied, the director of public works concurs that the resultant construction will be adequate to provide the required service or meet the anticipated need.
Whenever a subdivision is developed under the planned development provision of the zoning ordinance, wherein public open space as well as traffic and access requirements are being provided as part of an overall plan, the commission may vary the requirements of this chapter in any respect; provided that where construction standards or requirements are to be varied, the director of public works concurs that the resultant construction will be adequate to provide the required service or meet the anticipated need, and further provided that the overall dwelling unit density in the development is not greater than that permitted under the zoning ordinance.

Sec. 44-20. - Parcels or lots of land created or subdivided in violation of this chapter.

 
(a)
 
The owner of a lot or a parcel of land created or subdivided in violation of or without compliance with the provisions of this chapter may apply to the director of public works for the approval of a subdivision plat of said lot or parcel. The owner shall submit a plat for the proposed subdivision alone with the application and a filing fee of $300.00. The director of public works shall make an investigation of the facts and circumstances of the original illegal subdivision and the present status of the illegally subdivided lot or parcel of land and shall make a recommendation as to whether the application shall be approved or rejected, taking into consideration conditions that should be imposed and the following factors:
 
(1)





(2)


(3)


(4)


(5)
 
Whether it is impossible, impractical or infeasible to require the owner of the illegally subdivided lot or parcel of land (either alone or in conjunction with other owners of lots or parcels of land which were created or subdivided without compliance with the provisions of this chapter in conjunction with the illegal subdivision of the applicant's parcel of land) to make boundary adjustments, dedications or other changes so as to make the lot or parcel of land conform to the requirements of this chapter;
Whether the illegal subdivision was made in justifiable ignorance of the requirements of this chapter and without an intent to evade the requirements of this chapter;
Whether the lot or parcel of land was acquired by the present owner, or his predecessor in interest, in ignorance of the illegality of such lot or parcel;
Whether the failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter has materially impaired or hindered the ability of the owner of the lot or parcel of land to develop his property in a reasonable manner; and
Whether the public welfare and interest of the city will be protected and the general intent and purpose of this chapter will be preserved if the application is granted.
 
(b)








(c)


(d)
 
The director of public works shall forward his findings and his recommendations to the commission that shall review the application and forward its recommendation thereon to the council. The council may by ordinance approve the plat of the subdivision of the property upon such terms and conditions as the council determines will most equitably preserve the general intent and purpose of this chapter. The council may condition its approval upon the making of such boundary adjustments, dedications or other changes or conditions as the council deems necessary to preserve the purpose and intent of this chapter; and the council shall not enact an ordinance approving any such plat until the applicant has posted bond or other security satisfactory to the city engineer in an amount approved by the city engineer to assure to the city completion of any subdivision improvements required under the proposed ordinance for such property.
The enactment of an ordinance approving a plat of a lot or parcel of land created or subdivided in violation of or without compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall, with respect to approval of that plat, be in lieu of any other proceedings otherwise required under this chapter.
The owner shall file the plat with the county recorder of deeds within 60 days after council approval. If any such plat is not filed within this period, the approval shall expire. The owners shall provide the city with a copy of the recorded plat showing the book and page of recording as evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section.

(a)



(b)
 
The owner of lands included within a recorded plat or portion thereof may apply for the vacation of such plat or portion thereof by filing with the commission an application giving a specific legal description of the property affected, the reasons why such vacation is necessary and the anticipated impact of such vacation on adjacent lands, together with a filing fee of $300.00.
The owners of property within 185 feet of the land involved in the proposed vacation shall be notified by certified mail of the date and time of the meeting at which the commission will review the application and shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard at such meeting.
 

 
(c)
 
The commission shall study the proposal and its possible impacts and shall forward its recommendations thereon to the council. If the city council finds that the public welfare and interest of the city will be protected and that the general intent and purpose of this chapter will be preserved if the vacation is granted, the council may vacate the plat or portion thereof with such restrictions as it deems appropriate to protect the public interest. If the commission recommends against the vacation or if a protest against it is presented in writing to the city clerk duly signed and acknowledged by ten percent or more of the owners of land within 185 feet of the property involved in the proposal, the vacation shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of four-sevenths of all of the members of the council.

Any regulations or provisions of this chapter may be changed and amended from time to time by the council; provided, however, such changes or amendments shall not become effective until after study and report by the commission and after a public hearing thereon held by the council. If the commission submits no report within 60 days or such longer period as agreed to by council, it shall be considered to have made a report favoring the proposed changes or amendments.

The preliminary plan shall, in addition to the information prescribed in s e c t i o n 
 4 4 - 6 , provide locations of proposed buildings, the proposed property division within the existing or proposed buildings, the means of ingress/egress to the development, proposed easements and proposals with respect to trust indentures and public dedications.
Upon completion of the construction of required improvements, including final inspections and approvals by the responsible agencies, officials and companies, or the submission to the city of either a performance bond or escrow agreement in accordance with s e c t i o n 4 4 - 8 , together with approvals of detailed improvement plans and specifications, the applicant may submit a condominium plat for all or a portion of the lands covered by the preliminary plan. Such submission shall consist of an original drawing on reproducible Mylar and copies thereof in the quantity designated by the commission and shall conform to the requirements of RSMo ch. 448.
If the condominium plat conforms to the approved preliminary plan and if matters relating to required improvements are found in order, the commission shall recommend to the city council the approval of the condominium plat. If such is not the case, the commission shall recommend to the council that the condominium plat not be approved, and the applicant shall be informed in writing as to the reasons therefor.

The recommendation of the commission shall be presented to the council for its approval or rejection. If the condominium plat conforms to the approved preliminary plan and if matters relating to required improvements are found in order, the council shall approve the condominium plat. If such is not the case, the condominium plat shall not be approved. The applicant shall be informed in writing of the action of the council. If the commission has not approved the condominium plat, the council may approve said plat only by the affirmative vote of four-sevenths of all of the members.
Upon approval of the condominium plat by the city council, the mayor and city clerk shall place their signatures on the plat with the date of such approval. The applicant shall file the condominium plat with the county recorder of deeds within 60 days after approval by the city council. If any condominium plat is not filed within this period, the approval shall expire. Upon recording, the subdivider shall file with the director of public works one copy of the recorded plat showing the book and page of recording. Approval of the condominium plat does not constitute acceptance of dedications or improvements.
The subdivider of a condominium plat shall be subject to the requirements of sections 4 4 - 1 1 through 4 4 - 1 4 , inclusive. The condominium plat shall conform with the requirements of article II of this chapter, inclusive, except when a variance is granted in accordance with the provisions of
 s e c t i o n 4 4 - 1 9 .

At the time of filing the preliminary plan, the subdivider shall pay a fee of $600.00. At the time of filing the condominium plat, the subdivider shall pay an additional fee of $600.00.

The arrangement of streets shall reasonably conform as nearly as possible to the major street plan, and the developer shall make provision for the extension of major, collector and minor streets. Except for dead-end streets, streets normally shall connect with streets already established or provide for future connection to adjoining unsubdivided tracts or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivision tracts.
Whenever there are indications that an area being subdivided will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building plots, consideration shall be given in the street and lot arrangement of the subdivision to the need for future minor streets that will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
The requirements of this section shall apply to all streets whether dedicated to the public or retained as private streets.

The minimum right-of-way width shall be 80 feet for major highways, 60 feet for a collector street and 50 feet for a minor street; provided that the minimum for a permanent dead-end street less than 250 feet in length shall be 40 feet and further provided that right-of-way widths greater than the minimums may be required when needed to accommodate anticipated traffic volumes.
Whenever a street adjoins unsubdivided property for a distance in excess of 100 feet, a half street having a right-of-way width of not less than 30 feet may be permitted. When every property adjoining a half street is proposed to be subdivided, the remainder of the right-of-way shall be provided in accordance with the standards of this chapter for the class of street involved.
Where a subdivision abuts an existing accepted public street that does not meet the standards of this chapter, the commission shall require the additional right-of-way or construction improvement necessary to meeting such standards on the half of the right-of-way adjacent to the subdivision; provided that where the director of public works finds that, due to circumstances beyond the control of the subdivider, construction on only half of the right-of-way is not feasible, the commission may waive the required construction improvements, but only if the subdivider deposits with the city a sum equal to the cost of such improvements as estimated by the director of public works. The city will retain such funds for future street construction as approved by the city council.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major highway, the commission may require frontage streets parallel and adjacent to such highway or double-frontage lots with screen planting and nonaccess strips at the rear of such lots (adjacent to such highway).
Where topography or other construction make it desirable, a subdivision may include permanent dead-end streets; provided that if more than 150 feet in length, such streets shall terminate in a circular open space having a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and further provided that such streets shall normally not exceed 1,000 feet in length.
The minimum roadway width shall be 48 feet for major highways, 38 feet for collector streets and 26 feet for minor streets, provided that roadway widths greater than the minimums may be required when needed to accommodate anticipated traffic conditions. All streets shall be designed in acceptance with design criteria for the preparation of improvement plans, published by the county department of highways and traffic, and constructed in accordance with St. Louis County Standard Specifications for Highway Construction and shall include storm drainage facilities meeting the requirements of the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District.
Minor street intersection jogs or discontinuities with centerline offsets of less than 100 feet shall be avoided. Reserved strips of land which control or limit access at the terminus of streets are prohibited.
A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on major highways and collector streets and the minimum radius for curves on such highways and streets shall be 130 feet.
A subdivision entrance street shall intersect the major highway or collector street with an interior angle between 70 degrees and 90 degrees.

A minimum radius of 20 feet at the street right-of-way intersection and a minimum radius of 32 feet at the back of curb shall be required. Greater radii may be required at the intersection and at the back of the curb of a street intersecting with a major street. The commission may permit comparable cutoffs or cords in lieu of rounded corners.
All streets intersecting on major highways or collector streets shall be directly opposite existing or other proposed streets or shall be a minimum of 300 feet distant as measured between street centerlines.
Where a collector street enters or connects with a major highway, the city engineer must approve the entrance plan. Additional traffic lanes or other traffic safety improvements may be required.
All stub streets in excess of 150 feet in length shall be provided with a temporary turnaround.

Signs bearing the name of the street as designated on the final plat and meeting the size, height and style specifications of the city shall be placed at all street intersections, as well as at all points where the name of the street changes.
The subdivider shall pay for the installation of streetlights in accordance with the plan for lighting developed and installation work performed by Union Electric Company.
 

(t)
 

Such plan and installation work is subject to the approval of the city engineer.

Except as the commission deems necessary to secure the efficient use of land or desired features of street layout, block lengths shall not exceed 2,000 feet.
All side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to street lines unless the commission deems a variation will provide a better street and lot plan. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, lots with double frontage shall be avoided.
Lots shall have an area and lot width at the building line that conform with the requirements of the zoning districts in which the lots are located. The area of street rights-of-way, whether dedicated to the public or retained as private streets, shall not be included in calculating the area of lots.
Lots larger than the minimum required by zoning regulations are desirable. Lots shall have a width and depth entirely adequate to meet the yard requirements of zoning regulations. Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the establishment of front building lines on both the front and street side of the lot.
Where lots front upon a circular terminus of a dead-end street or upon a curve of a street having a radius of 200 feet or less, the minimum lot width at the right-of-way line shall be not less than 50 percent of the width required at the building line.
Building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for residential use and may be required by the commission for other lots when deemed necessary to secure a desirable pattern of development. Building lines shall provide for setbacks not less than required by ordinances of the city. Restrictions requiring buildings to be built at or behind the building line shall be either shown on the plat or contained in a separately recorded instrument referred to on the final plat.

The subdivider shall contract with and deposit the necessary funds with the county water company for waterlines and fire hydrants to serve all the lots in the subdivision and shall sign the contract provided, agreeing not to request said contract to be cancelled after the final plat is filed.
Where a public sanitary trunk sewer is reasonably accessible or where plans for the installation of such sanitary trunk sewer have been prepared and approved by the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, the subdivider shall connect with such sanitary trunk sewer and provide adequate sanitary sewer lines accessible to each lot, all in compliance with the ordinances of said district and under the supervision of said district. In the event that the connection with a planned trunk sewer line is not immediately practicable, the use of temporary disposal facilities will be permitted provided that such facilities are constructed in compliance with the standards and requirements of the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and the county department of health, and further provided that covenant provisions requiring owners to make such connection when it becomes practicable are either shown on the plat or contained in a separately recorded instrument referred to on the plat.
Adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwater, including, as may be necessary, improvement of channels, construction or reconstruction of bridges and the installation of enclosed pipes or conduits. In this connection the subdivider shall comply with the provisions of city ordinances regarding stormwater retention. Plans developed for the purpose of complying with these provisions shall comply with the requirements of the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District.

All subdivision boundary corners and all other points deemed necessary by the director of public works shall be definitely marked with permanent monuments. A permanent marker shall be constructed of concrete extending a minimum of four inches below the front line of steel pipe firmly imbedded in concrete that so extends below the frost line. Should conditions prohibit the placing of monuments on line, offset marking will be permitted provided that exact offset courses and distances are shown on the final plat. A permanent benchmark shall be accessibly placed, the elevation of which shall be based on the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929, and the location and elevation of which shall be accurately noted on the final plat.

Whenever any sanitary sewers, storm sewers, drainage channels or other improvements are required under this chapter or provided for or installed in any property, the subdivider shall provide, in a form and manner satisfactory to the city attorney, for the dedication for public use forever, to the city or the private company or other public agency responsible for the maintenance of such improvements, of all easements and installations for sanitary sewers or stormwater sewers or other drainage facilities, which easements and installations shall be subject to acceptance by the director of public works or such private company or other public agency.
Whenever a subdivider elects to dedicate streets to the city, he shall provide for the same in a form and manner satisfactory to the city attorney; and such dedication and improvement thereon shall be subject to acceptance by the director of public works.

The commission or its staff shall confer with the subdivider regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision and may agree with the subdivider as to certain minimum restrictions to be placed upon the property to prevent the construction of substandard buildings and control the type of structures or the use of the lots which, unless so controlled, would clearly depreciate the character and value of the proposed subdivision and of adjoining property. Deed restrictions or covenants should be included to provide for the creation of a property owners' association or board of trustees for the proper protection and maintenance of the development in the future.
Where the subdivision contains private streets, sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply systems, storm drainage areas or facilities, park areas or other physical facilities necessary or desirable for the welfare and benefit of the area which are not or cannot be satisfactorily maintained by any existing public agency, provisions shall be made by trust agreement and made a part of the deed restrictions, acceptable to any agency having jurisdiction over the location and improvement of such facilities, for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities.
All deed restrictions shall be shown on the plat or contained in a separately recorded instrument referred to on the final plat. In no event shall any deed restrictions or covenants contain reversionary clauses pursuant to which title to any lot shall revert to the subdivider as the result of a violation of the terms of any such deed restrictions or covenants where the reversion to the subdivider would serve no purpose beneficial to the subdivision and would be confiscatory in nature.

Parking lots. Certain spaces that are accessible and approximate to the facilities served by such parking areas should be set aside and identified for individuals with physical disabilities. These spaces should, where possible, be open on one side or be a minimum of 12 feet in width. The grade, surface quality and relation to other vehicle movements should be considered for maximum safety and convenience of the disabled person.

(Ord. No. 4062, § 902.08, 10-14-1980)


Sec. 56-40. - Blood banks prohibited in all districts.

Blood banks, both for-profit and not-for-profit, are hereby classified in all zoning districts of the city as a prohibited use. (Ord. No. 4062, § 902.09, 10-14-1980; Ord. No. 4511, § 1, 10-8-1991)

Sec. 56-41. - Performance standards.

 
(a)

(b)
 
Applicability. The performance standards shall apply to all present and future uses and developments in the city.

Enforcement of performance standards.
 

(1)



(2)



(3)
 

Whenever, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, there is a reasonable probability that any use or occupancy violates these performance standards, he is hereby authorized to employ a qualified technician or technicians to perform whatever investigations and analyses as are necessary to determine whether or not they are in fact being violated.
In the event that a violation is found to exist, the violator shall be liable for the reasonable fee of the technicians employed to perform such investigations and analyses. Such fees may be recovered as a penalty in the same manner as, and in addition to, the penalties specified in
 s e c t i o n 5 6 - 4 .

Any violation of this chapter shall hereby be considered as creating a public nuisance. Therefore, in addition to the enforcement procedures specified in this section, the regulations of c h a p t e r 3 4 , article VIII (nuisances) and any other applicable sections of this Code shall apply.
 
(c)
 
Standards. The following performance standards shall apply in accordance with the above criteria for applicability to any new or existing use located in the city. All uses shall be constructed, maintained and operated so as to not be injurious or offensive to the occupants of adjacent premises by reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration, smoke, dirt or other particulate matter, toxic or noxious waste materials, odors, fire and explosive hazard or glare.
 
(1)

(2)



(3)



(4)
 
Noise. Every use shall comply with the requirements of c h a p t e r 2 2 , article IV (noise regulations).

Vibration. A use shall be so operated that ground vibration inherently and recurrently generated is not perceptible without instruments at any point on the property line of the property on which the use is located. Although scientific tools such as the seismograph are often used to measure earthborne vibration, the situation in the city is such that the rule of thumb method should be sufficient.
Dust, dirt and other matter. Every use shall be so operated as to prevent the emission into the air of dust, dirt, noxious acids, fumes, gases and other particulate matter, whatever its source, which may cause damage to property and health of persons at or beyond the lot line of the property on which the use is located.
Odors. Every use shall be so operated as to prevent the emission of objectionable or offensive odors in such concentration as to be readily perceptible at any point at or beyond the lot line of the property on which the use is located. Unfortunately, to date, no adequate standard or equipment has been developed in order to scientifically assess this problem area. Therefore, a concept of "odor threshold" is often
 

employed to cover this municipal problem. The term "odor threshold" is defined as the lowest concentration of an odorous material that will cause a response in the human nose. All odors are covered, even so-called pleasant ones (candy, bakeries, etc.), which in concentration can be annoying to the public.

(2)
 

Application. Applications for a physically disabled accessibility ramp license shall be filed with the zoning administrator and shall include such information and materials as the applicant deems appropriate or as may be requested by the zoning administrator to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. The application shall include the name and address of the property owner, the name of the occupant(s) of the dwelling requiring a physically disabled accessibility ramp in order to be able to access the dwelling unit ("occupant") and documentation establishing the need for the location of such physically disabled accessibility ramp in such required yard in order for such occupant to be able to access the dwelling unit and otherwise addressing the standards set forth in this s e c t i o n 5 6 - 4 2 for issuance of the physically disabled accessibility ramp license.
Standards for physically disabled accessibility ramp license approval. The zoning administrator shall base the decision whether to approve a physically disabled accessibility ramp license on the following criteria:
 
a.	Whether it is strictly necessary for the proposed physically disabled accessibility ramp to be located in such yard in order for the occupant to be able to have access to the dwelling unit and whether there is any less intrusive means of providing such access.
b.	If the proposed physically disabled accessibility ramp is proposed to be located in the front yard setback, whether the proposed physically disabled accessibility ramp can be located in any rear or side yard and still provide access to the habitable space in the dwelling  unit.
c.	Whether the proposed physically disabled accessibility ramp minimizes the degree and nature of the encroachment into any required yards.
 
(3)



(4)



(5)
 
Authorization. If the zoning administrator makes a determination that the application for a physically disabled accessibility ramp license satisfies the criteria listed above, and subject to and in accordance with the limitations and conditions contained in this s e c t i o n 5 6 - 4 2 , the zoning administrator shall grant a physically disabled accessibility ramp license to the property owner for the benefit of the occupant.
Conditions. The zoning administrator may impose such terms, conditions or restrictions upon the construction, location and operation of the physically disabled accessibility ramp license, as the zoning administrator may determine in order to further the general objectives of the zoning ordinance and to minimize the possibility of injury to the value of property in the neighborhood.
Construction. The physically disabled accessibility ramp license granted by the zoning administrator shall expire unless construction of the physically disabled accessibility ramp commences within 12 months of the issuance of such license.
 
(d)



(e)
 
Transfer of accessibility license permit. The physically disabled accessibility ramp license shall be approved only for the specific occupant identified in the license and for the specific location approved in the license. The physically disabled accessibility ramp license may not be transferred to any other location or used for the benefit of any other individual.
Revocation of physically disabled accessibility ramp license. A physically disabled accessibility ramp license shall be surrendered by the property owner of the property for which it was issued whenever the need for the license as presented in the application shall no longer exist, in which case it shall be revoked and be of no further force or effect. Further, the zoning administrator may revoke a physically disabled accessibility ramp license in accordance with the procedure described below if any terms of the physically disabled accessibility ramp license have been violated.
 
(1)





(2)
 
If any terms of a physically disabled accessibility ramp license have been violated, a revocation of such physically disabled accessibility ramp license may be initiated by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall give 15 days' notice by certified mail to the property owner and to the occupant stating that the physically disabled accessibility ramp license may be revoked and stating the reasons for revoking such physically disabled accessibility ramp license and providing such property owner and occupant an opportunity to be heard.
Any such notice shall be addressed to the property owner at his or her last known address as shown on the property tax records for said property in the office of the Department of Revenue of St. Louis County and to the occupant at the address of the dwelling unit.
 
(f)
 
Duration. A physically disabled accessibility ramp license shall be effective for the time period from the date the physically disabled accessibility ramp license is issued and continuing so long as the occupant is occupying the dwelling unit and is only able to access the dwelling unit via the physically disabled accessibility ramp. The physically disabled accessibility ramp license shall expire on the earlier of the following to occur: (i) the
 

occupant no longer occupies such dwelling unit; or (ii) the occupant no longer requires a physically disabled accessibility ramp to access the dwelling  unit.
 
(g)
 
Removal of physically disabled accessibility ramp. Within 30 days after the revocation, expiration or termination of the physically disabled accessibility ramp license, the property owner shall remove the physically disabled accessibility ramp and repair and restore any damage caused to the property by the location or removal of the physically disabled accessibility ramp. If the property owner fails to remove the physically disabled accessibility ramp within 30 days of such revocation, expiration or termination, the city may remove the ramp, at the cost of the property owner. All costs and expenses incurred by the city in removing the ramp together with any legal fees incurred by the city in connection with enforcing such removal obligation may be assessed against the property in the form of a special tax bill, which special tax bill shall become a lien on the property and shall also be a personal liability of the property owner.

Bulk and intensity regulations.
 

a.	Floor area ratio. The maximum amount of gross floor area permitted for development on any lot shall not exceed an amount equal to one-half of the total area of that site, or an FAR of 0.5. Examples:

On a one acre site; FAR 0.5:
	
Allowable gross foor area	
21,780 sq. ft., w ½ × 43,560
	
Building height @ 20 percent Coverage	
2½ stories
	
Building height @ 50 percent Coverage	
1 story
	
Density @ 1,000 (1,200) sq. ft. foor area/du	
du -22(18) du/acre

Examples:

On a one acre site, FAR bonus:
	
Allowable gross foor area, FAR 0.5	
21,780 sq. ft.
	
Assume 1,600 sq. ft. in balconies to be provided (20 du × 80 sq. ft. × 2)	
3,200
	
Adjusted allowable foor area	
24,980



If average unit size were 1,000 square feet, the density would increase from 21.8 to 25.0 d.u./acre.

The CB district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of retail commercial and personal and business service uses including those which attract shoppers from a community or city-wide and larger market area, as well as convenience service retail uses.
The district seeks to give the highest priority to uses typically located in nucleated shopping districts which, in turn, serve a contiguous community and neighborhood shopping market. Included are small retail establishments of a convenience or service nature as well as specialized or larger shoppers' goods establishments, which together attract and require intensive pedestrian and vehicular traffic. At the same time, provision is
made to accommodate a variety of other business services, offices and entertainment uses which provide patronage to retail uses and a diversity of business activity.
It shall be the responsibility of the plan and zoning commission to ensure that the uses established in the CB district meet these purposes and that an appropriate balance of goods and services be made available within the CB district.

Definitions. The CB1 district shall be defined as follows: Street level locations along Manchester Road between the east right-of-way line of Roseland Terrace and its southern extension on the east and Sutton Avenue on the west.

Intent and purpose. The CB1 district is a subdistrict contained within the CB Community Business District.

The CB1 district seeks to give the highest priority to uses typically located in nucleated shopping districts which, in turn, serve and are compatible with the contiguous business community and neighborhood.
CB1 district permitted uses. Permitted uses in the CB1 district shall exclude the sale of used merchandise or rental of merchandise unless specifically identified below as permitted. The permitted uses enumerated in sections 5 6 - 2 0 4 and 5 6 - 2 0 5 shall not apply to street level locations within the CB1 district; instead the following uses shall be permitted in any street level location within the CB1 district:

Sec. 56-231. - Intent and purpose.

 
(a)



(b)


(c)
 
The AB district is intended to accommodate and regulate those business and commercial uses which draw customers primarily from motorists passing on the street or for whom a location on a highway or arterial street is especially useful or necessary. Such uses function relatively independent of intensive pedestrian traffic and proximity of other businesses.
Because they typically require direct access to automobile traffic and visibility from the street, careful consideration must be given to their effect on the efficiency and safety or traffic movement, as well as to their impact on adjacent areas and residences.
The uses permitted in this district consist primarily of ones which do not ordinarily seek locations in nucleated shopping centers and which therefore must be provided for at independent locations. Although some typical retail uses are permitted in the AB district, most of the uses permitted do not blend well into other retail shopping areas.

Sec. 56-665. - Setback.

All communication towers shall be set back (measured from the tower base):
 

(1)

(2)
 

From all yard lines, at least one foot for each foot of tower height; and

From the boundary of any residential district or any structure or property used for residential purposes, an additional two feet for each foot of tower height (total three feet).
 

(Ord. No. 4062, § 904.07(2), 10-14-1980; Ord. No. 4721, § 1, 3-12-1996)


Sec. 56-666. - Collocation.

 
(a)
 
Applications for new communication towers shall be considered only when an existing or approved communication tower cannot accommodate the communications equipment planned for the proposed communication tower.
 
(1)
 
An existing or approved communication tower cannot accommodate planned communications equipment if:
 

a.	Planned communications equipment would exceed the structural capacity of an existing or approved communication tower, and the communication tower cannot be reinforced to accommodate planned communications equipment at a reasonable cost;
b.	Planned communications equipment will cause radio frequency interference with other existing or planned communications equipment for that communication tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
c.	Existing or approved towers do not have space on which planned communications equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and at least in parity with other similar communications equipment in place or approved by the city;
d.	Addition of planned equipment to an existing or approved transmission tower would result in radio frequency emission levels on the tower in excess of those permitted under s e c t i o n 5 6 - 6 7 1 ; or
e.	Other reasons that make it impracticable to place the communications equipment planned by the applicant on an existing or approved communication tower.
 
(2)
 
No application for a new communication tower shall be considered unless the applicant demonstrates to the city that the applicant is unable to lease or otherwise secure space on:
 
a.	An existing or approved communication tower; or

b.	On any other structure (building rooftop, water tower, etc.) that would be capable of housing or supporting the planned communications equipment.
 
(3)






(4)
 
Shared use of an existing or approved tower or such other structure shall be conditioned upon the applicant's agreement to pay reasonable fees and costs associated with adapting existing facilities to the proposed use, including, but not limited to, reasonable costs for reinforcing or modifying a tower or structure, for preventing radio frequency interference, and other changes reasonably required to accommodate shared use. The fees and costs for shared use are unreasonable, among other reasons, if they exceed the cost of the proposed communication tower. The city may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fees and costs are reasonable.
Once the city finds that communications equipment proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or other structure, each tower or other structure so found is presumed unable to accommodate similar equipment that may be proposed in the future, unless evidence is introduced to demonstrate otherwise.
 
(b)
 
A communication tower operator, defined as any person or entity that owns or has a legal interest in a communication tower subject to the requirements of this division, and the owner of land upon which a communication tower is located or is proposed to be located pursuant to a pending application, but excluding any person or entity who is permitted to place particular equipment on a communication tower but otherwise has no ownership or general possessory interest in the communication tower, shall be required to:
 
(1)

(2)



(3)



(4)

(5)
 
Respond in a timely manner to any request from a potential user with information about the available capacity of the communication tower. Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request, required under this division, for information from a potential shared-use
applicant; the communication tower operator may charge a party requesting information under such section to pay a reasonable fee not in
excess of the actual cost of preparing a response.

Negotiate in good faith for shared use of a communication tower by applicants. Communication tower operators shall negotiate in the order in which requests for information are received, except a communication tower operator generally may negotiate with a third party applicant who has received an FCC license or permit before doing so with other applicants.
Allow shared use of a communication tower if an applicant agrees in writing to pay charges specified in subsection (b)(5) of this section. Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use, based on generally accepted accounting principals and pricing practices generally
reflective of the St. Louis area. The charge may include but is not necessarily limited to a pro rata share of the cost of site selection,
planning, project administration, land costs, site design, construction and maintenance, financing, return on investment, and depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing electromagnetic interference or causing uses on the site to emit radio frequency emissions in excess of levels permitted under s e c t i o n 5 6 - 6 7 1 .
 
(c)
 
Communication towers shall structurally accommodate the maximum number of foreseeable users technically practicable and shall be designed to comply with the following standards:
 
(1)
 
Television towers shall be designed to accommodate at least two high-power television antennas, four microwave antennas, one FM radio antenna, one radio antenna, and space for one public safety two-way radio antenna.
 

 
(2)


(3)

(4)


(5)





(6)
 
FM towers shall be designed to accommodate at least two FM antennas, four microwave antennas and space for one public safety two-way radio antenna.
Cellular, PCS or similar mobile or wireless telephony towers shall be designed to accommodate at least three potential users. Communication towers that are not for television or FM antennas shall be designed to accommodate at least two microwave antennas and
space for one public safety two-way radio antenna.

The city may reduce the required shared capacity of a tower if fewer or different antennas should be accommodated based on the number of FCC licenses that are potentially available for the area, kind of tower site or structure proposed, the number of existing and potential licenses without tower space, and space available on existing and approved towers; or if a tower necessary to provide for such sharing dominates and alters the visual character of the area adversely such that property values are diminished.
Antennas on a shared tower shall be arranged as follows, except as needed to prevent electromagnetic interference or to accommodate topographic or other physical or functional constraints:
 
a.	Transmitting and receiving equipment serving similar kinds of uses shall be placed on a shared-use tower so one of the users in a group can operate roughly equal to other users in the group with similar equipment.
b.	A TV tower shall have two side-mounted and one top-mounted TV antenna or one top-mounted, one mounted below it, and one side- mounted. Triangular, T-shaped, or other platforms or candelabra may be used if required communications equipment cannot be mounted as safely or economically without such structures.
c.	Microwave antennas and FM and two-way radio antennas can be placed anywhere on a tower above surrounding obstacles subject to the restrictions contained in these regulations.

Sec. 56-848. - Purpose.
 

The principal objective of this division is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses, and for the proper location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the city, and this chapter is based on the division of the entire city into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are basically compatible. In addition to such permitted, compatible uses, however, there are certain other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given distinct, but which, because of their potential impact upon neighboring uses or public facilities or the planned development of the community, need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this chapter as conditional uses, and are established and controlled by the provisions of this division.

(Ord. No. 4062, § 905.06(1), 10-14-1980; Ord. No. 4258, § 2, 6-10-1986; Ord. No. 4524, § 1, 3-24-1992; Ord. No. 4560, § 1, 11-10-1992; Ord. No. 4646, § 1, 5-24-

Applications. Applications for a conditional use permit shall include a site plan or an aerial depiction of the site in question and any necessary descriptive material relating to the intensity and extent of use and such other information as shall be required by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator may waive the site plan or aerial depiction requirement if it is determined that no exterior modifications, site modifications, parking issues or any other matters relating to the intensity and extent of use would necessitate said site plan or aerial depiction. An application for a conditional use permit may be filed only by the owner of the property in question or by a tenant, with the owner's permission.
Standards for conditional use permit approval. The zoning administrator shall post the property and mail notices to inform the public of the date, time and place of the plan and zoning commission meeting at which the conditional use permit application shall be considered, and of the date, time and place of the public hearing on such application to be held by the city council pursuant to this division. The zoning administrator shall refer the application to the plan and zoning commission to investigate and make a report and recommendation as to whether the following criteria are true with respect to the proposed conditional use:

Sec. 56-915. - Purpose.

Certain establishments and businesses are acknowledged to have special characteristics which may affect the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties; and it is the intent of these regulations to provide for the confinement of these establishments and businesses to those areas in the city in which these special impacts are judged to be least disruptive to the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties; and these regulations are further intended to require that these establishments and businesses shall not be permitted to be located in such concentration that their operational features may establish the dominant character of any area; and these regulations are further intended to protect and balance lawful rights of expression with other lawful rights to the enjoyment and the use of properties and these uses are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly if several such uses are concentrated, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas and could contribute to blight and degradation of the surrounding neighborhood; and the special regulation of these establishments and businesses is necessary to ensure that the secondary effects of such uses will not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods, whether residential or nonresidential but are restricted in use and concentrated so as to ensure the stability of such neighborhood.

Sec. 56-1002. - Review considerations.

In determining whether the evidence presented supports the conclusions required by s e c t i o n 5 6 - 1 0 0 1 , the board of adjustment shall consider the extent to which the evidence demonstrates that:
 

(1)



(2)


(3)


(4)
 

The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the property involved would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the owner, lessee or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of this chapter were literally enforced;
The request for a variance is not based exclusively upon the desire of the owner, lessee, occupant or applicant to secure a greater financial return from the property;
The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and
The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.

Sec. 56-1003. - Conditions and restrictions.

In granting a variance, the board of adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the property benefited by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in s e c t i o n 5 6 - 1 0 0 1 to deduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood, and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this chapter. Failure to comply with any of these conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of this chapter punishable as provided in s e c t i o n 5 6 - 4 .

In the event that the zoning administrator declines to consider, denies an administrative variance, or approves an administrative variance with modifications or conditions unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant shall be entitled to seek a variance directly from the board of adjustment. In addition, any person aggrieved by a decision of the zoning administrator granting an administrative variance may appeal to the board of adjustment as provided in subdivision II of this division. No variance granted by the zoning administrator shall remain valid unless the authorized reconstruction of the accessory use commences within 12 months after demolition of the previously existing structure.
