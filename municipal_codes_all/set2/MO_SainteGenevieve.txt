Mail may be created more informally than a paper memorandum; however, it must be
understood that e-mail maybe a public record. Public records are subject to the Sunshine
Law (Chapter 610, RSMo.) and to discovery, subpoena and may be used in litigation in
the same manner as other records of the City. E-mail must be managed and made
publicly accessible like public records in other physical formats. See item (2)(e) for
information concerning records retention.
All data and messages that are created, received, transferred to or from, or maintained
on any City computer are the property of the City.
All existing laws and City of Ste. Genevieve policies apply to conduct with e-mail,
especially those that deal with property protection, privacy, misuse of City resources,
harassment, data security and confidentiality.
E-mail provides a quick and easy way of communicating with friends and families.
Incidental and occasional personal use of e-mail is permitted. Appropriate personal use
does not: impede the conduct of City business; interfere with the user's work
performance or the performance of any other users; include use of a commercial nature;
or result in personal financial gain for the user.
As with paper communications, e-mail messages are subject to the retention schedules
provided in the Missouri Municipal Records Manual. Each department should establish
and maintain record retention schedules for their department including information
communicated through the e-mail system. Retention schedules per the requirements of
the Secretary of State are available from the City Clerk. Appropriate e-mails should be
printed and filed according to department policy.
E-mail users should be cognizant of the false sense of privacy and confidentiality
suggested by e-mail technology. In fact, more than other communications media, e-mail
facilitates the forwarding, copying and manipulation of messages beyond the creator's
control. The use of e-mail for communications containing confidential material or for
attorney-client communications is strongly discouraged.
All City e-mail addresses are listed on the website which makes it easy for people to
communicate through e-mail to each user. These people also expect responses to their
e-mail. It is the user's responsibility to administer their individual mailbox, including
checking e-mail at least daily and responding to e-mail promptly.
State law specifically includes electronic communications in the definition of "public
meetings" and "public records". Care should be given to ensure compliance with the
Sunshine Law (Chapter 610, RSMo.) when communicating "public business" with
members of a "public governmental body".
Monitoring. Employees should not have any expectation of privacy as to his/her e-mail usage.
It is possible to monitor the content of e-mail messages and the City may inspect any and all
files stored on City resources to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with City policy.
Random and/or routine monitoring of e-mail will only be done with the knowledge and
approval of the City Administrator.
E-mail etiquette.
It is recommended that you obtain confirmation of receipt for important e-mails sent.
Check your e-mail on each working day or arrange for a duly authorized person to do so
on your behalf and reply promptly to all e-mails requiring a reply. Where a prompt
detailed response is not possible, send a short e-mail acknowledging receipt and giving
an estimate of when a detailed response will/should be sent.

Proofread. Spelling and grammar mistakes can be just as distracting in an e-mail
message as they are in other written communications. Take time to proofread your
messages, especially messages that are used to communicate or document City
business.
Identify yourself. If you are acting on behalf of the City, identify yourself with name, title
and department. Include your e-mail address in the message and any attachments to it.
Don't be hasty. If a message or posting generates negative feelings, set it aside and reread
it later. An immediate response is often a hasty response. Don't rule out the
possibility that a misunderstanding or misinterpretation might occur.
Be careful what you say about yourself and others. As a general rule of thumb, don't
commit anything to e-mail that you wouldn't want to become public knowledge. Think
twice before posting personal information about yourself or others. There is always the
chance that a message could end up in someone else's hands. Be aware that e-mail
messages are often retained on system back-up tapes and disks in central computing
facilities after they are deleted from the mail system.
Internet Access.
Purpose. The City of Ste. Genevieve provides employees access to the vast information
resources of the Internet with the intention of increasing productivity. The underlying
philosophy of this policy is that Internet access from the City of Ste. Genevieve is primarily for
business-related purposes including communicating with customers, suppliers, colleagues, to
research relevant topics and to obtain useful business information. In addition, all existing
laws and City policies apply to your conduct on the Internet, especially those that deal with
intellectual property protection, privacy, misuse of City resources, sexual harassment, data
security and confidentiality.
Impermissible uses.
The display of any kind of obscene image or document on any City computing resource
may be a violation of existing City policy on sexual harassment. In addition, obscene
material may not be archived, stored, distributed, edited or recorded using City network,
printing or computing resources.
No employee may use City facilities knowingly to download or distribute pirated software
or data. Any software or files downloaded via the Internet may be used only in ways that
are consistent with their licenses or copyrights.
Downloading software should only be done with the approval and/or participation of the
City Administrator. Internet resources should not be used for downloading files for
personal use or utilized for entertainment purposes (streaming media, Internet radio,
etc.).
No employee may use the City's Internet facilities to deliberately propagate any virus,
worm, Trojan horse, trapdoor or back-door program code or knowingly disable or
overload any computer system, network, or to circumvent any system intended to protect
the privacy or security of another user.
The City Internet facilities and computing resources must not be used to knowingly
violate the laws and regulations of the United States or any other nation or the laws and
regulations of any State, City, province or local jurisdiction in any material way.
Employees should not use the Internet to make purchases or to sell items without the
approval of the City Administrator.

Section 130.200. Parole and Probation.
Any Judge hearing violations of municipal ordinances may, when in his/her judgment it may seem
advisable, grant a parole or probation to any person who shall plead guilty or who shall be
convicted after a trial before such Judge. When a person is placed on probation, he/she shall be
given a certificate explicitly stating the conditions on which he/she is being released.
In addition to such other authority as exists to order conditions of probation, the Court may order
conditions which the Court believes will serve to compensate the victim of the crime, any

limited to:
Restitution to the victim or any dependent of the victim in an amount to be determined by the
Judge; and

purposes as determined by the Judge.
A person may refuse probation conditioned on the performance of free work. If he/she does so,
the Court shall decide the extent or duration of sentence or other disposition to be imposed and
render judgment accordingly. Any County, City, person, organization or agency or employee of a
County, City, organization or agency charged with the supervision of such free work or who
benefits from its performance shall be immune from any suit by the person placed on parole or
probation or any person deriving a cause of action from him/her if such cause of action arises from
such supervision of performance, except for intentional torts or gross negligence. The services
performed by the probationer or parolee shall not be deemed employment within the meaning of
the provisions of Chapter 288, RSMo.
The Court may modify or enlarge the conditions of probation at any time prior to the expiration or
termination of the probation term.
Section 130.210. Right of Appeal.
In any case tried before the Municipal Judge, except where there has been a plea of guilty or where

Section 215.040. Abatement Procedure.
[CC 1985 §12-4; Ord. No. 2354 §5, 9-16-1980]
Whenever the Board of Aldermen receives notification that a nuisance may exist, it shall proceed
as follows:
The Board shall investigate the alleged nuisance and may order any person who has caused
or is maintaining the nuisance to appear before the Board at such time and place as it may
direct to show cause, if any, why that person should not abate the nuisance. Every person
required to appear before the Board shall have at least ten (10) days' notice thereof.
Notice of abatement shall be signed by the Chief of Police or City Administrator and shall be
served upon the person maintaining the nuisance by delivering a copy thereof to such person
or by leaving a copy at his/her residence with some member of the family or household over
fifteen (15) years of age or upon any corporation by delivering the copy thereof to the
president or to any other officer at any business office of the corporation within the City. If the
notice cannot be given for the reason that the person named in the notice or his/her agent
cannot be found in the City, of which fact the return upon such notice of the officer serving the
same shall be conclusive evidence, such notice shall be published in a daily newspaper for
three (3) consecutive days or once if a weekly paper, giving at least ten (10) days' notice from
the final publication date of the time fixed for the parties to appear before the Board of
Aldermen.
If after hearing all the evidence the Board of Aldermen determines that a nuisance exists, it
may direct the Chief of Police or other City Official to order the person maintaining the
nuisance to abate nuisance within twenty (20) days or within such other time as the Board
may deem reasonable. Such order shall be served in the same manner provided in
Subsection (2) for service of the order to show cause. The order may further provide that the
appropriate City Official be directed to abate the nuisance, if the order is not obeyed within the
time period set by the Board, and that a special tax bill be issued for the costs of abating the
nuisance.
If the order of abatement has not been obeyed within the time period set by the Board of
Aldermen, the appropriate City Official shall proceed to abate the nuisance in the manner
provided by the order of the Board and the cost of same, if ordered by the Board, may be
assessed as a special tax against the property so improved or upon which such work was
done. If so ordered, the City Clerk shall cause a special tax bill for the costs of abatement
against the owner of the property improved when known, and if not known then against the
unknown persons, and the certified bills of such assessment shall describe therein the
property upon which the work was done.
Special tax bills for the costs of abatement of nuisances shall be recorded and shall be
collected and paid as provided for the collection of other special tax bills for the repairing of
sidewalks or grading or paving of streets and shall be a lien on the property.
The cost of abating nuisances on private property shall be levied and assessed on each lot in
proportion to the amount of work done and material used in abating the nuisance located on
each such lot.

feet or less in diameter and two (2) feet or less in height, for pleasure, religious, ceremonial,
cooking, warmth or similar purposes.
No recreational fire may be started or allowed to continue burning unless such recreational fire is
fully contained within an approved fire pit or portable fireplace.
An approved fire pit is either a below-ground dug pit at least twelve (12) inches below grade
and not greater than thirty-six (36) inches inside diameter or square (inside edge of the pit to
the opposite inside edge), or an at-grade area not greater than thirty-six (36) inches in
diameter or square with a wall of material that can withstand high heat that is at least two (2)
feet in height. The area around a below-ground pit must be covered with non-combustible
material for a distance of three (3) feet from the edge of the pit. The bottom of either kind of
pit must be covered with non-combustible material, such as heat-resistant ceramic brick, sand
or rock.
A portable fireplace is a commercially available appliance designed to contain a wood fire
when operated according to manufacturer's instructions with all lids, screens and spark
arresting devices in place.
No recreational fire pit shall be closer than twenty-five (25) feet from any dwelling, building
structure, shed or garage or closer than ten (10) feet from any wooden fence, deck or combustible
material, including dry grass or leaves. Portable fireplaces shall not be within ten (10) feet of any
structure or combustibles; all recreational fires are to be set back a minimum of six (6) feet from
adjoining property lines. Portable fireplaces must be placed upon a secured, non-combustible
surface.
No recreational fires shall be started or allowed to continue burning when the wind direction or
wind speed will cause embers or other burning material to be carried onto any building,
combustible material or a neighboring property; nor at any time that the direction of the wind will
carry smoke into the open windows of any building.

yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and

erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
Section 315.070. Pedestrian Control Signals.
Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or "Don't Walk" or
appropriate symbols are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:
"WALK": Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of
the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
"WAIT" or "DON'T WALK": No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of
such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his/her crossing on the walk
signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.
Section 315.080. Flashing Signals.
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a
limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with
caution.
This Section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles
approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in Section
335.090 of this Title.
Section 315.090. Lane Direction Control Signals.

An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided
further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so
constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such
vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this State
after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.
Section 340.200. Stopping For School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.

electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
Section 340.210. Right-Of-Way At Intersection — Signs At
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.160.

Section 340.220. Distance At Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe and
prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the
roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.
Section 340.230. Traffic Nuisances.
No persons shall engage in any conduct involving the use of a vehicle which constitutes a disruption to
the peace and tranquility of the community by noise, smoke, smell or otherwise, nor shall any person
engage in conduct involving the use of a vehicle which causes or tends to cause damage to the streets
and highways of the City or any other public or private property. No persons shall engage a vehicle in a
manner of excessive acceleration which causes the squealing or burning of tires, the throwing of gravel
or other objects from the surface of the roadway or which causes said vehicle to proceed in other than
a straight line in his/her proper lane of traffic.

liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections (A) and (C) hereof, a parking prohibition shall
automatically go into effect on any part of any snow emergency route on which there has been an
accumulation of snow and ice of four (4) inches or more or there is the prediction that snow will
accumulate in such an amount.
Once in effect, a prohibition under this Section shall be in effect until terminated by announcement
of the Street Commissioner in accordance with this Chapter except that any street which has
become substantially clear of snow and ice from curb to curb for the length of the entire block shall
be automatically excluded therefrom. While the prohibition is in effect, no person shall park or
allow to remain parked a vehicle on any portion of any snow emergency route to which it applies.
However, nothing in this Section shall be construed to permit parking at any time or place where it
is forbidden by any other provision of law.

to be publicly announced by means of broadcast or telecast from a station with a normal operation
range covering the City and he/she may cause such declaration to be further announced in

Section 405.135. Planned Urban Development.
[Ord. No. 3503 §§1 — 2, 7-27-2006]
Introduction. The granting of a Planned Urban Development "PUD" shall be in accordance with the
procedure set forth below and in no way should be construed as an automatic right by the
applicant. The granting of a "PUD" is the legal responsibility of the Ste. Genevieve Board of
Aldermen upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The "PUD" shall be a
"floating zone" and shall not be attached to any land until such land is affirmatively rezoned as a
"PUD" consistent with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance of Ste. Genevieve.
Purpose Of The District. A "PUD" is intended to permit developments that will provide a desirable
and stable environment in harmony with that of the surrounding areas; to permit flexibility that will
encourage a more creative approach in the development of land, will result in a more efficient,
aesthetic and desirable use of area; to permit flexibility in design, placement of buildings, use of
open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas; and to best utilize the potential of
sites characterized by special features of geography, topography, size and shape.
Minimum Area. The area required to establish a "PUD" shall be a minimum of five (5) acres in all
zoning districts. In calculating the minimum area for a "PUD", the measurements shall not include
the area of any existing dedicated streets or alleys.
Permitted Uses Limitations. The Board of Aldermen shall designate each approved "PUD" as
either a "PUD A", "PUD R-1", "PUD R-2", "PUD R-3", "PUD C-1" or "PUD C-2". Such designation
shall limit the general range of uses permitted in the designated "PUD" to the range of uses which
are permitted in the corresponding zoning districts as set forth in the table below:
"PUD" DESIGNATION PERMITTED USES AS PROVIDED IN CORRESPONDING
DISTRICTS:
"PUD A" "R-1", "R-2", "C-1", "C-2", "C-3", "I-1", "I-2"

Development Density.
Calculations of density. The Board of Aldermen shall approve the maximum density allowed in
any "PUD". The Board of Aldermen shall only approve a maximum density compatible and in
harmony with existing surrounding densities or future densities indicated by the City's
Comprehensive Plan. In calculating the density for a tract of land, the applicant is encouraged
to consult the City's Comprehensive Plan to assure compatibility and harmony with
surrounding densities. If density bonuses are requested under this Subsection, the applicant
is expected to document all site amenities or improvements for the City's review and
consideration.
Density bonuses. To encourage utilization of the "PUD" technique, an applicant may be
eligible for a maximum increase of thirty percent (30%) in the total "floor area ratio" over that
which would otherwise be allowed. For the purposes of this Subsection, "floor area ratio" shall
mean the gross floor area of all buildings in the "PUD" divided by the land area of the "PUD".
Such density increases may be granted only by the Board of Aldermen according to the
following criteria:
MAXIMUM
PERCENTAGE
INCREASE DESIGN ELEMENT
5% For each contiguous five percent (5%) area of "PUD" consisting of not
less than one-half (½) acre devoted to improved usable open space.
5% Provision of pedestrian ways (pedestrian, bicycle paths).
5%
Provision of high quality tree and shrub planting, including peripheral
and interior screen planting and fencing, landscaping and parking lots
and the use of existing trees in the plan. This provision is in addition to
the required screening requirements.
5%
Creative building site designs and groupings that take advantage of
natural terrain and minimize future water runoff and erosion problems.
Basins and water features included in the overall design are
encouraged.
10%
Recreational facilities (i.e., swimming pool, tennis court and community
center or club building. The Board of Aldermen shall approve the
density bonus for recreational facilities up to ten percent (10%) upon
consideration of the size, quantity and type of facilities provided.
Management And Use Of Open Space In A Planned Urban Development. Note: This Section shall
be read in conjunction with the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Ste. Genevieve.
In a "PUD", all land not subdivided into lots or used as the building site for multiple-family
dwellings, for public roads, alleys, privately maintained off-street parking facilities, drainage
easements, utility easements, potential or existing school sites, drainage canals or detention
basins shall be deemed "open space" and be disposed of in either of the following methods:
Dedication to the City.
The geographic configuration, area, location and interest in land (e.g., fee,
easement) to be dedicated to the City for open space shall be as finally approved by
the Board of Aldermen with consideration of the recommendations of the Planning
and Zoning Commission.

The Board of Aldermen may also require any such dedicated land to be improved as
usable space for recreational purposes before accepting any dedication.
A notation shall be placed on the recorded plat identifying all property dedicated to
the City together with the stated purpose for which the property was dedicated to the
City.
Every parcel of open space dedicated to the City shall have frontage along a public
road.
Ownership by a non-profit homeowners association or other legally responsible entity.
The Board of Aldermen may require that ownership of open space in a "PUD" be held by
a non-profit homeowners' association or other legally responsible entity. Open space held
by such an association shall, at minimum, be open to residents, patrons and employees
who may live, shop or work within the "PUD" boundaries. The association shall maintain
the common land and any buildings, recreation facilities, sidewalks, private utilities,
sewers or private streets upon such common land. The association may levy among all
owners of lots and all owners of condominium units for the purpose of raising funds to:
Maintain the common land.
Pay real estate taxes assessed on the common land.
Pay any insurance premiums on the common land.
Pay for any improvements that the association deems necessary for the common
land.
Review guidelines (site development plan).
In conjunction with the submittal of an application for a "PUD", the applicant shall submit
a site development plan for review and approval. The site development plan shall comply
with the requirements of Subsection (G)(4) below. Additional information pertinent to the
specific development proposed may also be required on the site development plan. The
application and site development plan shall first be referred to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for review and report.
Upon receipt of the report of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Board of
Aldermen shall hold a public hearing to consider the proposed "PUD" and shall provide
legal notice in compliance with Section 405.230 of the City's Zoning Ordinance.
In reviewing the site development plan, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Board of Aldermen shall consider the following criteria:
Compliance with the requirements of this Section regarding land uses and density,
including specific reasons and documentation for recommending increased density if
such recommendation is made.
General conformance and compatibility with the City's Comprehensive Plan.
The internal relationship of land uses within the proposed "PUD" to existing and
future uses in the surrounding area.
The general layout of the internal transportation system, including parking and
pedestrian circulation and the relationship of that system to exterior transportation
facilities and the major streets plan.
The adequacy of proposed public facilities including water supply and distribution,
sanitary sewers, storm drainage, school site and recreational areas.

[Ord. No. 2345 §XIII, 10-16-1979]
The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the adoption of this Chapter may be continued
even though such use does not conform with the provisions hereof, except that non-conforming
use buildings may be enlarged up to fifty percent (50%) of their building area existing on the
effective date of this Chapter.
If no structural alterations are made, a non-conforming use of a building may be changed to
another non-conforming use of the same or more restricted classification. The foregoing
provisions shall also apply to non-conforming uses in districts as may be hereafter changed.
Whenever a non-conforming use of a building has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
When a building, the use of which does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter, is damaged
by fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than sixty-five percent
(65%) of its fair market value, it may only be restored upon the issuance of a permit by the Board
of Adjustment as provided in Section 405.220 of this Chapter.
In the event that a non-conforming use of any building or premises is discontinued or its normal
operation stopped for a period of two (2) years, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the
use permitted in the district in which it is located.
A non-conforming use occupying only a portion of a building may be extended throughout the
building if the same has been lawfully acquired and actually devoted to such use previous to the
adoption of this Chapter or to any affecting amendments thereof.

Every public utility, cable company, video services provider and other users of the City's rights-ofway
or adjacent easements to provide services shall comply with the supplemental regulations in
this Section regarding the placement of accessory utility facilities on public or private property. For
purposes of this Section, "accessory utility facilities" shall mean such facilities, including pedestals,
boxes, vaults, cabinets or other ground-mounted or below ground facilities, that directly serve the
property or local area in which the facility is placed, are not primarily for transmission or
distribution to other locations, do not materially alter the character of the neighborhood or area and
otherwise are customarily found in such areas. Except where limited by other provisions of City
ordinance, accessory utility facilities shall be subject to the following supplementary regulations:
Approval — design — location — application — notice. The design, location and nature of all
accessory utility facilities on private or public property shall require approval of the City, which
approval shall be considered in a non-discriminatory manner, in conformance with this
Section and subject to reasonable permit conditions as may be necessary to meet the
requirements of this Section. To that end, prior to any construction, excavation, installation,
expansion or other work on any accessory utility facility, the facility owner shall apply to the
City and submit detailed plans for the City's review and approval. Contemporaneous with
such application, the facility owner shall provide notice to all private property owners within
one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of the location of the proposed construction, excavation or
other work. Notice shall include detailed description of the proposed work to be done, the
exact location of proposed work and the anticipated time and duration of the proposed work.
Notice shall be given at least five (5) business days prior to the commencement of any such
work. In considering individual applications or multiple location applications, the City shall
review the request to ensure the proposed facilities do not impair public safety, harm property
values or significant sight lines or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining properties or
neighborhood and taking into consideration reasonable alternatives. Any material changes or
extensions to such facilities or the construction of any additional structures shall be subject to
the requirements and approvals as set forth herein. Unless otherwise prohibited, accessory
utility facilities subject to this Subsection may be located in minimum setback areas provided
that all other requirements are met. To the extent permitted by Section 67.2707.1(3) RSMo.,
the time, method, manner or location of facilities to be located in the rights-of-way may be
established or conditioned by the City to protect the rights-of-way or to ensure public safety.
An inspection fee shall be required as may be established by the City to reimburse the City for

All such facilities shall be placed underground, except as otherwise provided in
Subsections (3) and (4) herein or as approved by special use permit.
All such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit
any unnecessary or intrusive noise.
All facilities shall be deemed abandoned after six (6) continuous months of non-use and
shall therefore be removed within thirty (30) days thereafter at the cost of the facility
owner. Land from which abandoned facilities are removed, whether private or public
property, shall be restored within thirty (30) days of removal by the facility owner or have
costs of such remedies charged to the facility owner. The facility owner shall restore the
land using similar plantings or sod of the same type of grass immediately surrounding the
land and shall replace all existing plantings damaged by the removal work with like
plantings and shall replace all damaged existing grass areas with sod of the same type of
grass as was damaged.
Unless otherwise restricted, utility poles for authorized above ground lines or facilities
shall be permitted up to forty-five (45) feet in height, except for arterial roads where such
poles shall be authorized on one (1) side of such roads up to sixty (60) feet in height,
where utilities are not otherwise required to be placed underground; provided that such
poles shall be no higher than necessary, maintained so as to avoid leaning from upright
position and without use of guy wires crossing rights-of-way or pedestrian routes except
where approved by the City as necessary due to the lack of feasible alternatives.
Accessory utility facilities placed in designated historic areas may be subject to additional
requirements regarding the placement and appearance of facilities as may be necessary
to reasonably avoid or reduce any negative impact of such placement.
Any damage to landscaping or vegetation on private or public property during installation
or maintenance of facilities shall be remedied by the facility owner within thirty (30) days
of such damage.
No facility may be located so as to interfere or be likely to interfere with any public
facilities or use of public property.
All such facilities proposed to be located within the Historic Preservation Overlay District
shall be required to obtain a certificate, of appropriateness in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Chapter 410 of the City Code.
All accessory utility facilities not authorized by this Subsection or specifically addressed
elsewhere in this Code shall be authorized only by a special use permit pursuant to
Section 405.200 of the City Code.
Residential districts. In residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto, accessory utility
facilities less than three and one-half (3.5) feet in height and covering less than eight (8)
square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the City. Except
as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger utility facility shall be installed underground
or authorized to be installed above ground only by special use permit. All above ground
facilities, where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical. If locating
these facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side
yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public rights-of-way
unless otherwise approved by the City upon a determination that all other alternatives are not
feasible.

the main building has been actually commenced and no accessory building shall
be used for dwelling purposes, other than by domestic servants employed
entirely on the premises.
Accessory buildings may be built in a required rear yard but such accessory
buildings shall not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of a required rear yard
and shall not be nearer than five (5) feet to any side or rear lot line, except that
when a garage is entered from an alley, it shall not be located closer than ten
(10) feet to the alley line. If a garage is located closer than ten (10) feet to the
main building, the garage shall be regarded as part of the main building for the
purposes of determining side and rear yards.

Section 405.180. Development Standards For Vehicular Use
Areas.
[Ord. No. 2345 §XVII, 10-16-1979; Ord. No. 2363, 10-7-1981]
All vehicular use areas except those located on, under or within buildings and those serving
single- and two-family dwellings shall conform to the minimum requirements hereinafter provided:
Before a building permit is issued for any type construction, other than single-family or twofamily
dwelling buildings, where off-street parking and open lot sales display and service
areas are provided, a portion of such areas shall be given over to landscaping and natural
plant growth as specified in items 6, 7 and 8 as follows.
Prior to the development of any vehicular use area, an application for a grounds permit shall
be obtained from the Zoning Administrator. Issuance of the permit will be contingent upon the
following:
Submission of a vehicular use plan. At the time of submittal of building plans, the
developer shall submit to the Zoning Administrator three (3) copies of a combination site
plan/planting plan hereafter referred to as vehicular use plan. At the time of submission of
the plan, the applicant shall pay the City a filing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). In zones
where the proposed use requires special approval by the Board of Aldermen, such
approval shall constitute authority for issuance of a grounds permit.
Review of the vehicular use plan. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the plan, the Zoning
Administrator shall submit said plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its
review and recommendation. If the vehicular use plan is found to be in compliance with
the requirements of this Section, a grounds permit shall be issued. During this review
phase, the Planning and Zoning Commission may establish conditions for approval of the
vehicular use plan. In no case shall the Planning and Zoning Commission impose
landscape standards over and above the following maximum criteria:
One (1) tree for each forty-five (45) linear feet of perimeter (the three (3) foot buffer
strip surrounding the actual parking area).
One (1) tree for each eight hundred (800) square feet or fraction thereof of required
interior landscaped area.
Upon completion of site improvements, the Zoning Administrator shall inspect the vehicular
use area for compliance with the approved vehicular use plan and other requirements of this
Section.
Landscaped areas, walls, structures and walks shall require protection from vehicular
encroachment through appropriate wheel stops or curbs.
The owner, tenant and their agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
maintenance of all landscaping which shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a
healthy, neat and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris.
The exterior (property line) perimeters of all vehicular use areas shall be landscaped with a
buffer strip which averages at least three (3) feet in width. The landscape strip shall be
improved with grass, ground cover, shrubs or other landscape treatment excluding paving,
sand or gravel. Exceptions from these perimeter landscaping requirements are as follows:
When abutting public street right-of-way. Necessary accessways from the public street
right-of-way shall be permitted to service the vehicular use areas.
3/8/2020 City of Ste. Genevieve, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/ST3440?guid=27812218,27812294,27812310,27812407,27812443,27812517,27812540,27812607,27812640,27812… 296/538

When adjacent to a public alley. Landscape requirements for abutting vehicular use
areas shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator and shall be based on existing
use and treatment of surrounding property, except where authority for such determination
is with the Board of Aldermen or the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
An area or a combination of areas equal to ten percent (10%) of the total vehicular use area,
exclusive of perimeter landscape buffers, shall be devoted to interior lot landscaping. When
the vehicular use area is related to a structure or structures on the same parcel of land, any
landscaping on said parcel which serves to beautify the entire parcel of land may be counted
toward meeting the interior landscaping requirement. Planters shall be located to most
effectively relieve the monotony of large expanses of paving and contribute to the orderly
circulation of traffic.
When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way or other accessways, or when the
property abuts the intersection of two (2) or more public rights-of-way, all landscaping within
the triangular area referred to as the "cross-visibility area" shall provide unobstructed cross
visibility at a level of between three (3) and six (6) feet. Trees having over six (6) feet of clear
trunk with limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner so as not to extend into the crossvisibility
area shall be permitted in such area, provided they in no way create a traffic hazard.
In instance where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to development, in whole or in
part, for purposes of off-street parking or other vehicular use areas, the Zoning Administrator
may adjust the application to allow credit for such plant material. Any removal of existing trees
may be accomplished with approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission during site plan
review.
Adequate surface and subsurface drainageways for the removal of stormwater from vehicular
use areas shall be provided whenever available evidence indicates that such a system is
necessary as the result of natural surface drainage. Such systems shall be separate and
independent of the sanitary sewer system and have adequate surface inlets.
The extent to which storm drainage structures shall be required shall be based on an analysis
of need as determined by an engineer or similar official during preliminary consideration of the
vehicular use plan.
In the absence of a storm sewer system and curbing, a water retarding grass shall be planted
in the exterior perimeters of the vehicular use area.
Any person proposing to locate a structure or a use within one hundred (100) feet of any
stream or main drainage ditch located within any portion of the City's 100-year floodplain, as
identified by the Federal Insurance Administration through a scientific and engineering report
entitled Flood Insurance Study of the City of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, shall include as a part
of the vehicular use plan a statement by a registered professional engineer or similar official
that the development will not be in conflict with the floodplain management regulations of the
City of Ste. Genevieve and based on a study of the floodway, watershed area and probably
runoff, the structure or use in the location proposed will leave adequate space for the flow of
flood water and that no structure or use within the 100-year floodplain shall be located within
the floodway or within seventy-five (75) feet of the top of the bank of any stream or main
drainage ditch, whichever setback from the main stream channel is greater.
In areas outside the City's designated 100-year floodplain, a water retarding grass shall be
planted along any stream or open main drainage ditch in an area extending a minimum of
fifteen (15) feet from the top of the bank of any stream or main drainage ditch to a proposed
vehicular use area. In cases in which the vehicular use area is adjacent to or abuts a stream
or main drainage ditch, the required three (3) foot perimeter for vehicular use areas may be
included as a part of the fifteen (15) foot setback from the stream or main drainage ditch.

Section 405.190. Corner Visibility.
On corner lots, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to
materially impede vision between a height of two (2) feet and eight (8) feet above curb grade within the
triangular area formed by an imaginary line that follows street pavement edges and a line connecting
them twenty-five (25) feet from their point of intersection. This sight triangle standard may be
increased, by the City Engineer, when deemed necessary for traffic safety.
Section 405.200. Special Use Regulations.
[Ord. No. 2345 §XVIII, 10-16-1979; Ord. No. 3815 §1, 7-26-2012]
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Ste. Genevieve may,
after public hearing before the Board of Aldermen and after study and report by the City Planning

affirmative as to any subject, then such permit shall be denied. In the granting of a special use
permit, the Board of Aldermen may impose, and the Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend, appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be deemed necessary to ensure
compliance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance and to protect adjacent property and
conserve property values.
Applications for special use permits shall be made and processed in the same manner as
provided for zoning amendments in Section 405.230.
The following special uses are authorized providing they comply with all the regulations set forth in
this Chapter for the district in which such use is located, except that the Board of Aldermen may
permit hospitals and institutions to exceed the height limitations of such district:
Cemetery or mausoleum.
Greenhouse or nursery.

Chapter. The development plan shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for
study and report. Approval shall be conditioned upon specific findings that the proposed
community unit plan meets the following conditions:
The proposed development of any "C-3" Planned Commercial District included as a part
of the plan complies with the regulations for those districts as set forth in Section 405.100
of this Chapter.
The buildings, other than those located within a "C-3" District, located in the area shall be
used only for one-family dwellings, two-family dwellings or multiple-family dwellings and
the usual accessory uses such as private or parking garages, storage space and for
communities activities, including churches and schools.
The average lot area per family contained in the site, exclusive of the area occupied by
the "C-3" District or by streets, will not be less than the lot area per family required in the
district in which the development is located.
That the area is adaptable to complete community development, being bounded by major
thoroughfares, streets, railroads or other external barriers and insofar as possible without
a major thoroughfare extending through the project or any other physical feature which
would tend to impair the neighborhood or community cohesiveness.
No more that twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross area of the project be devoted to a
"C-3" District and that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the gross area of the project
located in a single-family district be devoted to multiple-family dwellings.
Sufficient area is reserved for recreational and educational facilities to meet the needs of
the anticipated population or as designated in the Comprehensive Plan.
Property adjacent to the area included in the plan will not be adversely affected and to
this end, the Board of Aldermen may require, in the absence of any appropriate physical
barrier, that uses of least intensity or a buffer of open space or screening be arranged
along the borders of the project.
The plan is consistent with the intent and purposes of this Chapter to promote public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
If the Board of Aldermen approves the plans, building permits may be issued, even though
the use of the land and the location and height of buildings to be erected in the area and the
yards and open space contemplated by the plan do not conform in all respects to the district
regulations of the district in which it is located.
An application for a special use permit under this Section may be made and processed
contemporaneously with a proposed amendment of the district in which such site lies.
A special use permit shall automatically expire upon failure to develop the use of the land for
which the special use permit has been issued if the use is not basically developed within one
(1) year after the permit has been issued.
In the event the use of the land for which the special use permit has been issued is
discontinued for a period of one (1) year, then the special use permit shall automatically
expire.
If a special use permit is issued for a commercial use, and such use requires the
owner/operator to have a license from the City, State or Federal Government, possession of a
valid license from the appropriate issuing agency shall be a condition of the permit.

Section 410.310. Review of Public Improvement and Land
Acquisition Projects.
[Ord. No. 3945 §1, 2-12-2015]
Public improvement and land acquisition projects by the City or any of the City's departments or
agencies shall be reviewed by the Commission in the following manner:
The Commission shall review and comment upon any public improvement project proposed
by the City or any of the City's agencies or departments within the National Register Historic
District on the site of or within two hundred (200) feet of any landmarks or within two hundred
(200) feet of any boundary of the National Register Historic District. The Administrator shall
send a completed preliminary design for a public improvement project to the Commission
simultaneously with its submission to the Board for approval. The Commission shall have at
least thirty (30) days to complete the Commission's review and report to the Board.
The Commission shall review and comment upon any proposed acquisition of a landmark or
of land or buildings within an historic district by the City or any of the City's agencies or
departments. The Board or the Administrator shall, at the earliest date that will not interfere
with acquisition negotiations, send the Commission information concerning the location, size,
purchase price, current use and proposed use of the land or building to be acquired and
specify the date by which the Commission shall report to the Board.
The Commission shall review the public improvement or land acquisition projects to
determine the public improvement or land acquisition's effect upon the historic, archaeological
or architectural character of the landmark or National Register Historic District and report to
the Board within any time specified by the Board or Administrator, but not to exceed forty-five
(45) days. The report by the Commission shall include any recommendations for changes to
the preliminary design or land acquisition that will lessen or alleviate any adverse effect of the
proposed project upon the historic, archaeological or architectural character of the landmark
or the National Register Historic District. The Board shall take no final action on the land
acquisition or initiate construction of the public improvement until the Board has received and
reviewed the report of the Commission.
Section 410.320. Standards for Review.
[Ord. No. 3945 §1, 2-12-2015]
Commission Review.
In considering an application for Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall follow,
as applicable, substantive provisions of the "Design Guidelines for the Sainte Genevieve
National Register Historic District" prepared by Winter and Company, dated June, 2001 and
the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as stated below:
A property shall be used for the property's historic purpose or be placed in a new use that
requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and the building's
site and environment.
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall
be avoided.
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of the property's time, place and
use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding

conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be
undertaken.
Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance
in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship
that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity
of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match
the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and
preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be
undertaken.
New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and the property's environment.
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a
manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic
property and the property's environment would be unimpaired.
The design guidelines shall be maintained at City Hall. In the event there are conflicting
substantive provisions between the design guidelines and the standards as set forth herein,
the stricter provision shall prevail.
Administrator Review. In considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness for
structures and/or sites within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of a landmark within the H-2
Historic District Overlay or non-contributing structure and/or sites within the National Register
Historic District, the Administrator shall consider the guidance set forth in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5
of the Design Guidelines for the Ste. Genevieve National Register Historic District.
Section 410.330. Signs — Certificates of Appropriateness

landmark or on a structure within a historic district not specified in the designating ordinance must
receive a certificate of appropriateness from the Administrator who shall review the proposed sign
in accordance with the minimum design standards and the following general guidelines. No public
hearing shall be required for an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a sign which is
otherwise in conformance with the City's ordinances affecting signs. A public hearing shall be
required in accordance with, and in the same manner as, provisions for a special use permit for
any sign not in conformance with the City's ordinances affecting signs.

preserved.
Some existing signs may not be appropriate, especially if they disguise, obstruct or
detract from significant facade elements.

signs. These signs should identify occupants on upper floors or those not considered the
primary occupants.
Each occupant may have not more than one (1) sign applied directly on glass of upper
windows. Upper window signs may consist of individual letters not over six (6) inches in
height. Total sign dimensions should be no greater than fourteen (14) inches in height.
In addition to upper window signs, each occupant may have one (1) ground floor entry
sign located at the entry way with individual letters painted or located directly on glass,
door, plaque or directory.
Illumination. Any sign lighting shall be properly shielded or diffused so as to eliminate glare.
Exceptions. The following are appropriate in addition to those signs listed above:
Names of buildings, dates of erection, monumental citations and commemorative tablets
which do not exceed twenty (20) square feet in area when made a permanent integral
part of a building.
Educational signs not exceeding ten (10) square feet providing bulletin or poster display
space, identifying or explaining local history or other processes.

Section 420.010. Statutory Authorization — Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 1 §A, 4-22-2004; Ord. No. 3736 §1, 5-26-2011]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Chapter 89 (Section 89.020) of the State Statutes
delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of
the City of Ste. Genevieve ordains flood regulations as set out herein.
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a
series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could
be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as
delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Ste.
Genevieve County dated July 4, 2011, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Section 420.020. Statement of Purpose.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 1 §B, 4-22-2004]
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Article I, Section 420.010(B); to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined

in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR
60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
Article II. General Provisions
Section 420.030. Lands To Which Chapter Applies.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 2 §A, 4-22-2004; Ord. No. 3736 §2, 5-26-2011]
This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri

and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Chapter, no development shall be
permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the Board of
Aldermen or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the Board of
Aldermen or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance
of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article
IV.
Section 420.040. Floodplain Administrator.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 2 §B, 4-22-2004]
The City Administrator is hereby designated as the Floodplain Administrator under this Chapter.
Section 420.050. Compliance.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 2 §C, 4-22-2004]

A.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes.
Section 420.080. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 2 §F, 4-22-2004]
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams

elevated one (1) foot above base flood elevation.
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that
below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Article III, Section
420.120(9).
Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas
below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings
may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided

[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 4 §D, 4-22-2004]
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article II, Section 420.030 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Article IV, Section 420.170(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV.

Section 420.230. Conditions For Approving Floodplain
Management Variances.
[Ord. No. 3360 Art. 5 §E, 4-22-2004]
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Subsections (B) through (F)
below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State inventory of historic places or local inventory of
historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's
continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:

accordance with Article IV, Section 420.140(D)(2) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure in accordance with Article IV, Section 420.140(D)(1) of this
Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific
flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Article IV, Section 420.140(D)(4) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with Article IV, Section 420.150(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Article IV, Section 420.170(2) of this Chapter. No variances

If a building is vacated or unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the Building Commissioner may post a placard of condemnation on the premises
and may order the structure closed up with plywood so as to prevent that structure from becoming a
public nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the condemned structure within the time
specified in the order, the Building Commissioner may cause those premises to be closed up with
plywood through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the
cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon which the condemned structure is located
and shall thereafter become a lien upon that real estate. In addition, any structure which is ordered to
be closed up shall have at least one (1) no trespassing sign posted in a prominent place on each of its
outside walls. All closing up with plywood shall be done in accordance with regulations for such work
kept on file in the office of the Building Commissioner.

Section 515.100. Design Criteria.
[CC 1985 §5-63; Ord. No. 2963 §1(Art. II §2.3), 5-14-1998]
The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to managing stormwater
runoff:
Point of runoff.
Rooftop storage. Although rooftops are a significant portion of impervious area, they can
be designed to release stormwater slowly to effect detention by installation of controlled
outlets. By designing drain outlets to release water at one (1.0) cfs per acre of rooftop at
a storage depth of two (2) inches, the roof area may be considered to be pervious ground
for purposes of this Section.
Structural and material aspects of ponding must be taken into account by the design
architect or engineer.
To avoid the possibility of an overload, the roof should be designed with multiple outlets
and free overflows, the latter providing a rapid release rate should any controlled outlet
become clogged or the storage is exceeded by a storm of greater than design intensity.
Upstream temporary storage.
Parking lot storage. Temporary storage on parking lots may be effectively utilized for
commercial, industrial, institutional and multi-family projects. To ensure proper function of
system, property owner shall check system periodically, clean as necessary. There may
be some inconvenience to the users of the parking lot, but usually it will be no more
serious than a temporary delay.
To prevent possible damage to vehicles, the depth of ponding must be limited. A
maximum depth of six (6) inches will be permitted for automobiles, whereas eighteen (18)
inches will be permitted for lots serving only over-the-road tractors and trailers.
A parking lot storage facility design should include overflow arrangements to prevent
damage to downstream properties. Grated inlets shall not be used to provide outlet
control because of the possibility of clogging. Open-throated curb or area inlets, pipe
orifices or pipe friction may be used for outlet control.
Swale and channel storage. Temporary storage of stormwater in a swale or channel is an
effective and relatively maintenance free technique which may be applicable if an
acceptable restricted outlet and overflow device are provided.
On-stream detention.
For many on-site and most off-site stormwater management facilities, on-stream
techniques will be most feasible. These techniques are suitable for larger watersheds
and may serve any kind of development. They can be developed on a watershed basis
as joint effort between two (2) or more developers.

Temporary storage is achieved by damming streams or by diverting stormwater flows
from the stream to storage areas, which would not otherwise be available for the design
flow. The amount of storage provided is dependent on the inflow and the allowable
release rate. In all cases, a suitable emergency spillway or other device is made
available for the safe passage or by-pass of runoff in excess of that which can be
handled by the principal release structure.
On-stream impoundments or storage areas may be designed to drain after the cessation
of the storm and be normally dry in which case they are called detention ponds. If a
permanent pool is provided, only the storage provided above the normal pool will be
considered as available for stormwater management.
Criteria.
The minimum hydrologic criteria for projects subject to stormwater management shall be
that the two (2) year and the fifteen (15) year design discharges of stormwater shall be
no greater than those which would occur prior to any development.
Runoff coefficients and times of concentrations for pre- and post-development conditions
shall be computed on the basis of the rational method. Other methods may be used with
approval from the City Engineer. The durations analyzed shall be the following:
The duration equivalent to the time of concentration for the site, but as a minimum,
ten (10) minutes.
One (1) hour.
Twenty-four (24) hours.
The maximum storage capacity and permitted discharged rate shall be based upon the
maximum calculated volume and peak flow of stormwater runoff, respectively The
maximum calculated volume and peak flow may result from storms of different durations.
Design.
Sufficient volume must be provided in a detention facility to store the amount of runoff in
excess of the discharge rate.
Several analytical routing methods exist in practice for the determination of detention
volumes based upon routing inflow hydrographs through storage basins. The most widely
used is the storage-indication method, which is based on an equation, which is solved
repeatedly for each time period for the duration of the hydrograph:
I + I
2
(t - t ) -
O - O
2
(t - t ) = S - S
where: t and t = time at beginning and end of time period,
respectively
I and I = flow rates at beginning and end of time
period
O and O = outflow rates at beginning and end of time
period
S and S = storage volume at beginning and end of
time period
The equation expressed above states that the average inflow for the time period, minus
the average difference in outflow rates for the time period, equals the net storage

(15) year differential runoff rate from the site under proposed development conditions.
Detailed instructions and examples are given in National Engineering Handbook, Section
4, Hydrology, U.S. Soil Conservation Service (1972).
Flows from upstream areas outside the site should be based upon the assumption that
those areas are fully developed under forecast use patterns. The required storage
volume will be based upon the site only, with flows from upstream areas being by-passed
or discharged via overflow spillways or other devices.
Construction timing of runoff control measures shall be integrated in the construction
schedule during the course of development as directed by the City Engineer.
If detention storage is provided within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage
volume above that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the
development. No credit will be given for volumes below the elevation of the base flood at
that location unless compensatory storage is also provided.
The City Engineer shall submit all calculations and plans for the proposed management
system to the City for review and approval.
General design features.
Dry bottom basins. Basins may be constructed to temporarily detain the stormwater
runoff so that the rate at which it is released is the same rate as or less than before
development. The following features shall be incorporated into the design of any
detention basin:
Storage volume. The volume of storage provided shall be sufficient to provide
enough storage to control the differential runoff from the 2-year or 15-year frequency
storm, whichever is greater.
Freeboard. Detention storage areas shall have adequate capacity to contain the
storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff with at least two (2) feet of freeboard
above the water surface.
Outlet control works.
Outlet works shall be designed to limit peak outflow rates from detention storage
areas to or below peak flow rates that would have occurred prior to the
proposed development.
Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components or devices and shall
function without requiring attendance or control during operation, unless
specifically approved by the City Engineer
Spillway. Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe passage of runoff
generated from a 100-year storm after detention of the design frequency storm.
Maximum depth. The maximum planned depth of stormwater stored shall not
normally exceed five (5) feet.

Side slopes. The maximum side slopes for grassed basins shall not exceed one (1)
foot vertical for three (3) feet horizontal.
Limits of ponding. In no case shall the limits of maximum ponding be closer than
thirty (30) feet horizontally from any building and less than two (2) feet vertically
below the lowest sill elevation.
Interior drainage. The basin bottom should be designed to drain expeditiously. If the
bottom is to be grass, it shall have a minimum slope of two percent (2%).
Low flow channel. Small flows through the detention basin should be handled by
paved ditches from inflow structure to outflow structure to minimize erosion.
Multi-purpose basins. If the detention basin is to have other uses, the design of the
basin bottom should include underdrains to expedite drying of the bottom between
runoff events.
Aesthetics. Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing configurations which will
enhance public acceptability.
Wet bottom basins. Wet bottom basins may also be used to temporarily detain the
differential runoff from the development. In addition to the general design features
enumerated above for the dry bottom basins, the following features shall be incorporated
into the design of any wet bottom basin:
Normal pool depth. In order to minimize weed growth, the normal pool depth should
be four (4) feet minimum.
Depth for fish. If fish are to be kept in the pond, at least one-quarter (¼) of the area
of the permanent pool should have a minimum depth of ten (10) feet.
Facilities for emptying. In order to ease cleaning of the pond or shoreline
maintenance, the pond design should include provisions for emptying the pond.
Bank stabilization. In order to minimize the effects of waves or ice, some type of
bank stabilization such as riprap or concrete may be placed along the normal pool
shoreline.
Slide lopes below normal pool. The side slopes below the normal pool elevation may
exceed the maximum side slope permitted above normal pool (3:1 slope). The
design shall, however, include provisions for a safety ledge having a depth of water
not greater than three (3) feet immediately adjacent to the shoreline. A qualified
geotechnical engineer shall determine the maximum permissible side slope below
the normal pool elevation.
Earthen basins. To minimize the effects of erosion due to transient stormwater flows,
earthen basins shall be sodded up to a minimum of one (1) foot above the maximum
anticipated high water elevation within the basin.
Maintenance. Designs of stormwater systems shall incorporate features which facilitate
their inspection and maintenance. The growth of obnoxious weeds, the creation of
conditions which support the growth of mosquitoes and other insects and the decrease in
available storage by accumulated sediments must be controlled. The cleanup of
accumulated debris, flotsam and other materials after runoff events have subsided must
be assured. Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities servicing more than one
(1) lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds unless
responsibility is formally assigned to the City.

Article III. Bonds, Maintenance Assurances and Fees
Section 515.110. Performance Bonds and Other Assurances For
Completion and Operation of Stormwater Management
Improvements.
[CC 1985 §5-69.23; Ord. No. 2963 §1(Art. III §4.1), 5-14-1998]
Upon approval of the stormwater management plan, but before the issuance of a building permit or
subdivision plat approval, the City shall require the applicant to post a performance bond, cash escrow,
certified check or other acceptable form of performance security in an amount sufficient to ensure the
execution of the plan. After determination by the City that all facilities are constructed in compliance
with the approved plan, the performance bond or other securities shall be released. The City Engineer
shall recommend the amount of the bond, escrow or letter of credit.
Section 515.120. Maintenance Agreement.
[CC 1985 §5-69.24; Ord. No. 2963 §1(Art. III §5.1), 5-14-1998]
The owner of the tract of land to be developed shall agree to maintain all stormwater facilities
upon said land tract. The owner in preparation of the plat to be recorded at the Recorder of Deeds
office shall provide for a statement of maintenance responsibilities:
"All drainage easements and all improvements therein, as shown on the plat, shall not be
dedicated to the City of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, but shall remain with and run with the property
and shall be maintained solely by and at the expense of the owners of the property abutting
thereto."
Maintenance Responsibilities For Stormwater Management Facilities.
Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish maintenance standards to ensure that
after stormwater management facilities have been properly designed and constructed, they
continue to function properly. Continued proper functioning is highly dependent upon the
proper maintenance of the facilities.
Design of facilities. Maintenance costs over a period of years will generally surpass the costs
of initially constructing water management facilities. The applicant and the administrative
officer should utilize all appropriate methods, approaches and techniques to design and
construct these facilities in such a manner that fulfills the requirements of this Article,
facilitates their inspection and minimizes future maintenance costs.
Maintenance responsibilities. The growth of noxious weeds, the creation of conditions which
support the growth of mosquitoes and other insects and the decrease in available storage by
accumulated sediments shall be controlled. The cleanup of accumulated debris, flotsam and
other materials after runoff events have subsided shall be assured.
Detention facilities, when mandatory, are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer
installation and/or grading. Since these facilities are intended to control increased runoff,

they must be partially or fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation. Silt
and debris connected with early construction shall be removed periodically from the
detention area and control structure in order to maintain close to full storage capacity.
All stormwater detention facilities shall be contained within a stormwater easement,
dedicated to the City and the party(ies) responsible for management and maintenance of
the system.
The responsibility for maintenance of stormwater management facilities in single-lot
development projects shall remain with the owner, developer and general contractor until
final inspection of the development is performed and approved and a legal occupancy
permit, where applicable, is issued. After legal occupancy of the project, the maintenance
of stormwater management facilities shall be vested with the property owner.
The responsibility for maintenance of stormwater management facilities in subdivision
projects shall remain with the developer until such time as responsibility is transferred,
under appropriate legal arrangements, to the private individual owners in the subdivision,
the City or such other maintenance entity or authority as may be proposed and approved
by the Board of Aldermen.
If responsibility is to be transferred to the private individual owners in the subdivision, the
developer shall assure perpetual maintenance of the drainage management facilities,
including detention systems, if any are included, through the adoption of maintenance
agreements or covenants for any facilities that remain in private ownership. Such
agreements or covenants shall be subject to the approval of the administrative officer.
If the responsibility is to be transferred to the trustees of the subdivision, the developer
shall establish a suitable indenture of trust. Upon release of escrow required for the
subdivision development, the responsibility for maintenance shall be vested in the
trustees of the subdivision by virtue of the trust indenture. The indenture of trust shall
clearly indicate resident responsibility for maintenance and shall be subject to the
approval of the administrative officer.
Responsibility for maintenance of closed systems is transferable to the City providing the
system to be maintained by the City shall have adequate dedicated easements,
dedicated to the public for stormwater management use, to permit the City to inspect and
enter upon the property, as necessary, to maintain the system.

user may construct, maintain, own, control or use facilities in the rights-of-way without a
franchise or ROW agreement with the City as provided herein. A franchise shall be
obtained in conformance with all applicable franchise procedures for any ROW user
seeking to use the rights-of-way for purposes of providing cable television service or
distribution of electricity, gas, water, steam, lighting or sewer public utility service in the
City.

specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other rights
to use the rights-of-way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems
appropriate, subject to all applicable law. The granting of an agreement or franchise shall not
be deemed to create any property interest of any kind in favor of the ROW user. All franchises
and agreements shall be approved by ordinance of the Board of Aldermen on a nondiscriminatory
basis provided that the applicant is in compliance with all applicable
requirements. Such franchises and agreements shall be deemed to incorporate the terms of
this Article and other applicable laws of the City, except as may be expressly stated in such
agreements and franchises.

Excavations made in or under streets, walks or driveways are to be backfilled with granular
material thoroughly compacted into place as specified in the City Engineer's "Specifications for
Excavation Work" and the pavement surface restored to its original best condition. In such
locations, excavation materials are to be removed from the site of the work as soon as practical
after excavation is made and no such material unduly allowed to accumulate on the site. The
location of the work shall be swept and cleaned following the excavation work.
Approved granular backfill material shall be composed of either crushed rock or crushed gravel,
free of clay lumps, trash or dust-sized particles. The maximum size shall not exceed one (1) inch.
Quarry materials or gravel are to be placed in horizontal layers no greater than a loose thickness
of ten (10) inches and shall be densified by mechanical tamping or vibration. The minimum density
of such material shall be not less than one hundred five (105) pounds per cubic foot dry weight
basis. The contractor shall present written documentation from an acceptable testing laboratory to
the Field Operations Supervisor that such compaction has been achieved. As an alternative to the

placement of "lean mix backfill", a mixture of Portland cement, granular aggregates, water and fly
ash, mixed and applied as specified in the City Engineer's "Specifications for Excavation Work". In

corporation is not sufficiently qualified to perform resurfacing work as determined by the Field
Operations Supervisor, the City Street Department may contract to have such work done and make the
necessary changes as outlined in this Article. Contractors and utility companies engaged in the
construction, replacement or repair of utility lines in paved areas shall be required to perform backfilling
and repaving operations as part of the construction or replacement project and to furnish the City
satisfactory guarantee covering performance of the work in accordance with City specifications.

When the restoration work referred to in Section 520.160 is completed by the person, firm or
corporation making or causing to be made the excavation, the street surfacing so replaced shall, for a
period of one (1) year following the date of restoration, be the responsibility of the excavator who shall
bear all costs of maintenance on the repaired portion for such time. Failure to comply with the
requirements of this Section shall constitute a violation of this Article and the City may, in addition to
prosecution for violation, use such portion of the bond deposit provided in Section 520.120 as is
necessary to maintain or repair unsatisfactory replacement of a street surface and no further permits
shall be issued to any person, firm or corporation whose bond deposit has been thus depleted or
diminished.

or travel upon the streets, avenues, sidewalks or other public use places when possible. When such
use is unavoidably obstructed, the person making the excavation shall exercise all reasonable dispatch
in prosecuting the work so that the public use will not be obstructed beyond a reasonable time. In
cases where excavations are made entirely across a public highway and adequate detour for traffic is
not available, a substantial driveway shall be maintained across such excavation until such excavation
is refilled. Detours may not be established except on special permit from the Field Operations
Supervisor and then only after notice to the Fire Department, Police Department and ambulance
service of the City. All sidewalks, crosswalks, curbs, gutters, streets, avenues, alleys or public places
disturbed, interfered with or injured in making any excavation shall be restored, replaced and repaired
to as good condition as they were before such excavation was made.

carried in a firm or corporation which has been licensed or permitted to carry on such business in the
State of Missouri and shall be kept and maintained continuously in force and effect so long as the

required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and
to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analysis involved
will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls or a premise is appropriate
or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH analyses are determined from periodic grab samples.)
No statement contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by
the industrial concern.

Section 715.130. Review of User Charge System.
[Ord. No. 3647 §3, 12-29-2009]
The City of Ste. Genevieve shall review the user charge system annually and revise user charge
rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates adequate revenues to pay the costs of
operation and maintenance including replacement and that the system continues to provide for the
proportional distribution of operation and maintenance including replacement costs among users
and user classes.
The City will notify each user at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate being
charged for operation and maintenance including replacement of the treatment works.
Section 715.140. Sewer Charges and Billing.
[Ord. No. 3647 §5, 12-29-2009; Ord. No. 3727 §2, 4-14-2011; Ord. No. 3755 §1, 9-22-2011; Ord. No.
3825 §1, 9-13-2012]
Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on their use of the treatment
works as determined by water meter(s) acceptable to the City.
For residential contributors, monthly user charges will be based on average monthly water usage
during the months of January, February and March. (Water usage for these months includes little
use for such activities as lawn watering, car washing and other seasonal consumptive uses. The
winter quarter average should not be used in areas that experience large seasonal fluctuations in
population and/or usage.) If a residential contributor has not established a January, February, and
March average, their monthly bill shall be the median charge of all other residential contributors.
For industrial and commercial contributors, user charges shall be based on water used during the
current month. If a commercial or industrial contributor has a consumptive use of water or in some
other manner uses water which is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user
charge for that contributor may be based on wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s)
installed and maintained at the contributor's expense and in a manner acceptable to the City.
The minimum charge for sewer service per customer shall be at least six dollars seventy cents
($6.70). In addition, each customer shall pay a user charge for operation and maintenance
including replacement of at least four dollars four cents ($4.04) per one thousand (1,000) gallons
of water, or $.0302 per cubic feet. A customer that has one (1) water meter that serves multiple

dwelling units shall be charged by taking the number of units times the minimum rate of six dollars
seventy cents ($6.70), plus the operation and maintenance including replacement fee of four
dollars four cents ($4.04) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water, or $.0302 per cubic feet.
Thereafter, the rates shall be set according to the following schedule, with the same procedure
being used for meters serving multiple dwelling units at the applicable rates, subject to annual
ratification by the Board of Aldermen which shall occur commensurate with the approval of the
annual budget:

2017 $7.69 $4.63 ($.0346)/cu.ft.)
2018 $7.84 $4.73 ($.0353/cu.ft.)
For those contributors which contribute wastewater, the strength of which is greater than normal
domestic sewage, a surcharge in addition to the normal user charge will be collected. The
surcharge for operation and maintenance including replacement is:
$ .549598 per pound of BOD
$ .549598 per pound of SS
Any user which discharge any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing
the effluent or the sludge from the City's treatment works, or any user which discharges any
substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the
cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for such
increased costs. The charge to each user shall be as determined by the responsible plant
operating personnel and approved by the Board of Aldermen.
The user charge rates established in this Section shall apply to all users of the City's treatment
works regardless of the user's location.
Section 715.150. Billing and Payment.
[Ord. No. 3647 §6, 12-29-2009]
All users shall be billed monthly. All sewer bills shall be due and payable on the fifteenth (15th) of
the month and shall become delinquent on the sixteenth (16) of the month. If any bill rendered by
the City is not paid by the end of said month, the City may discontinue services to such customer.
When service is disconnected due to non-payment, the total amount of the outstanding bill, plus
applicable reconnection charges, shall be paid before the service is rendered.
A late payment penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the user charge bill will be added to each
delinquent bill for each fifteen (15) days of delinquency. When any bill is thirty (30) days in default,
rendition of water and/or sewer service to such premises shall be discontinued until such bill is
paid following due notice and opportunity of hearing.
