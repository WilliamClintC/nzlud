record or vote to be closed from the public in violation of any provision
in Chapter 610, RSMo., such latter member shall state his or her
objection to the motion at or before the time the vote is taken on the
motion. The public governmental body shall enter in the minutes of the
public governmental body any objection made pursuant to this
Subsection. Any member making such an objection shall be allowed to
fully participate in any meeting, record or vote that is closed from the
public over the member's objection. In the event the objecting member

time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the
actual cost of research time. Based on the scope of the request,
the City shall produce the copies using employees of the City
that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research
and duplication time. Prior to producing copies of the requested
records, the person requesting the records may request the City
to provide an estimate of the cost to the person requesting the
records. The custodian shall receive, or may require, payment prior
to duplicating documents.
2. Upon request, the public government body shall certify in writing
that the actual cost of record search and duplication is fair,
reasonable and does not exceed the actual cost incurred by the
public governmental body.
3. The City may furnish documents without charge or at a reduced
charge when the City determines that waiver or reduction of the
fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities
of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requestor.
4. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films,
pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches shall include only the cost of copies, staff time,
which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for staff of
the City required for making copies and programming, if necessary,
and the cost of the disk or tape or other medium used for the
duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats that require special
expertise to duplicate may include the actual rate of compensation
for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps,
blueprints or plats. If programming is required beyond the
customary and usual level to comply with a request for records or
information, the fees for compliance may include the actual costs of
such programming.
A. As used in this policy, the following terms shall have these prescribed
meanings:

exempt from disclosure, the Clerk shall separate the exempt and nonexempt
material and make the non-exempt material available for
examination and copying in accord with the policies provided herein.
When designing a public record the Clerk shall, to the extent
practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting
to inspect or receive copies of the form, the Clerk shall generally
describe the material exempted unless that description would reveal
the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of
the exemption.
C. Maintenance Of Closed Records. [Ord. No. 5396, 12-3-2018]
1. Records required to be closed shall not be destroyed; they shall be
inaccessible to the general public and to all persons other than the

executive order.
2. These records shall be made available only for the purposes and to
the entities listed in this Section. Upon receipt of a request for
criminal history information under its control, the Police
Department may require positive identification, to include
fingerprints of the subject of the record search, prior to releasing
closed record information. Dissemination of closed and open
records from the Missouri criminal records repository shall be in
accordance with Section 43.509, RSMo. All records which are
closed records shall be removed from the records of the courts,
administrative agencies, and law enforcement agencies which are
available to the public and shall be kept in separate records which
are to be held confidential and, where possible, pages of the public
record shall be retyped or rewritten omitting those portions of the
record which deal with the defendant's case. If retyping or
rewriting is not feasible because of the permanent nature of the
record books, such record entries shall be blacked out and recopied
in a confidential book.
D. Police Records. If the person arrested is charged but the case is
subsequently nolle prossed, dismissed or the accused is found not guilty
or imposition of sentence is suspended in the court in which the action
is prosecuted, official records pertaining to the case shall thereafter be
closed records when such case is finally terminated except as provided
in Section 610.120, RSMo., and except that the court's judgment or
order or the final action taken by the prosecutor in such matters may be
accessed. If the accused is found not guilty due to mental disease or
defect pursuant to Section 552.030, RSMo., official records pertaining
to the case shall thereafter be closed records upon such findings,
except that the disposition may be accessed only by law enforcement
agencies, child-care agencies, facilities as defined in Section 198.006,

A public governmental body or record custodian in doubt about the legality
of closing a particular meeting, record or vote may, subject to approval by
the City Council, bring suit in the Circuit Court for the County of St. Louis
to ascertain the propriety of such action. In addition, subject to approval
by the City Council, the public governmental body or custodian may seek a
formal opinion of the Attorney General or an attorney for the City regarding
the propriety of such action. In such events, the proposed closed meeting or
public access to the record or vote shall be deferred for a reasonable time
pending the outcome of the actions so taken.

feasible because of the permanent nature of the record books, such
record entries shall be blacked out. Entries of a record ordered
expunged pursuant to Section 610.123, RSMo., shall be removed from
all electronic files. All records ordered to be expunged pursuant to
Section 610.140, RSMo., shall be closed in the manner established
therein and in Section 610.120, RSMo. [Ord. No. 5396, 12-3-2018]
State Law References — As to similar provisions, §§ 610.120, 610.124,
RSMo.
A. Policy Statement. While it is legally permissible for members of the
City's public governmental bodies to attend meetings and vote via
videoconference transmission, a member's use of videoconference
attendance should occur only sparingly. Because it is good public policy
for citizens to have the opportunity to meet with their elected officials
face to face, elected members of a public governmental body should
endeavor to be physically present at all meetings. The primary purpose
of attendance by videoconference connection should be to
accommodate the public governmental body as a whole to allow
meetings to occur when circumstances would otherwise prevent the
physical attendance of a quorum of the body's members. A secondary
purpose of attendance by videoconference should be to ensure that all
members may participate in business of the public governmental body
that is emergency or highly important in nature and arose quickly so as
to make attendance at a regular meeting practically impossible. Except
in emergency situations, all reasonable efforts should be expended to
ensure that a quorum of the members of the public governmental body
be physically present at the normal meeting place of the body.
Section
130.070
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
130.090
AO:60
B. Videoconference Defined. For purposes of this Section,
"videoconference" or "videoconferencing" shall refer to a means of
communication where at least one (1) member of a public governmental
Body participates in the public meeting via an electronic connection
made up of three (3) components: (1) a live video transmission of the
member of the public governmental body not in physical attendance; (2)
a live audio transmission allowing the member of the public
governmental body not in physical attendance to be heard by those in
physical attendance; and (3) a live audio transmission allowing the
member of the public governmental body not in physical attendance to
hear those in physical attendance at a meeting. If at any time during a
meeting one (1) or more of the elements of a videoconference becomes
compromised (e.g., if any participants are unable to see, hear, or fully
communicate), then the videoconference participant is deemed absent,
and this absence should be reflected in the minutes.
C. Frequency Of Use Of Videoconference Attendance. A member of a
public governmental body shall not attend more than two (2) meetings
via videoconference in a rolling twelve-month period. Attendance via
videoconference should only occur sparingly and for good cause. Such
good cause shall be at the discretion of the member seeking to attend
by videoconference, but shall include reasons such as serious illness or
injury of the member or a member of his or her immediate family,
including father or mother, spouse, sibling, child, or grandchild.
D. Physical Location. The City shall cause there to be provided at the
physical location communication equipment consisting of an audio and
visual display, and a camera and microphone so that the member(s)
participating via videoconferencing, the members of the public
governmental body in physical attendance, and the public in physical
attendance may actively participate in the meeting in accordance with
rules of meeting decorum. The communication equipment at the
physical location of the meeting should allow for all meeting attendees
to see, hear, and fully communicate with the videoconferencing
participant.
E. Voting. Elected members of a public governmental body attending a
public meeting of that body via videoconference are deemed present for
purposes of participating in a roll call vote to the same effect as elected
members of a public governmental body in physical attendance at a
public meeting of that governmental body are deemed present. If any
component of the videoconference communication fails during the
meeting, the member attending the meeting by videoconference whose
connection failed shall be deemed absent immediately upon such
failure. If the public governmental body was in the act of voting, the
voting shall stop until all of the components of videoconference
attendance are again restored and the videoconference participant's
presence is again noted in the minutes, or the member is determined to
be absent.

[Ord. No. 5332 § 2, 9-19-2016]
F. Closed Meetings. In a meeting where a member of a public
governmental body is participating via videoconferencing and the
meeting goes into a closed session, all provisions of Missouri law and
City ordinances relating to closed sessions apply. Upon the public
governmental body's vote to close the meeting, all members of the
general public shall not be present. Likewise, a member of a public
governmental body participating via videoconferencing must ensure
there are no members of the public present at his or her location to see,
hear, or otherwise communicate during the closed session. The member
must also take all reasonable precautions to guard against interception
of communication by others.
G. Minutes. In any open or in closed session, the minutes taken should
reflect the member, if any, participating via videoconference, the
members in physical attendance, and members, if any, absent.
H. Emergency Meetings. In the event that emergency circumstances
create impossibility for the members of a public governmental body to
physically attend, the body as a whole may meet and vote by
videoconference. Examples of such emergency circumstances include,
but are not limited to, war, riot, terrorism, widespread fire, or natural
disaster such as earthquake, tornado, hurricane, flood or blizzard. To
the extent reasonably possible in such circumstances, the public
governmental body shall use reasonable efforts to cause a physical
location to be provided for public attendance and participation.
A. Crime scene photographs and video recordings, including photographs
and video recordings created or produced by a State or local agency or
by a perpetrator or suspect at a crime scene, which depict or describe a
deceased person in a state of dismemberment, decapitation, or similar
mutilation including, without limitation, where the deceased person's
genitalia are exposed, shall be considered closed records and shall not
be subject to disclosure under the provisions of this Chapter unless
otherwise ordered by court or required by law; provided, however, that
this Section shall not prohibit disclosure of such material to the
deceased's next of kin or to an individual who has secured a written
release from the next of kin. It shall be the responsibility of the next of
kin to show proof of the familial relationship. For purposes of such
access, the deceased's next of kin shall be:
1. The spouse of the deceased if living;
2. If there is no living spouse of the deceased, an adult child of the
deceased; or
3. If there is no living spouse or adult child, a parent of the deceased.

conventional bidding process, the department head need not follow the
conventional bidding process exclusively. Such purchases shall be
documented by the department head and given prior approval by the
City Manager. Examples would include, but not be limited to,
circumstances where time is a crucial factor, when the procurement
involves high technology items, or when there is obvious economy in
purchasing from a particular vendor.
D. Cooperative Purchasing. Department heads are encouraged to use
cooperative purchasing programs sponsored by the State of Missouri or
other public agencies or jurisdictions. Cooperative purchasing can
prove advantageous to the City both by relieving personnel from
securing required bids and by taking advantage of large quantity
purchases made by cooperative government entities. Purchases made
through these programs have met the requirements of competitive
bidding and require no further documentation. Department heads are
encouraged to check with the State and other jurisdictions regarding
cooperative procurement contracts in effect prior to making any large
purchases. The City Manager has the authority to approve such
purchases.
E. Confidential Expenditures. Confidential expenditures such as payments
to informants, purchase of materials as evidence (such as narcotics), or
other uses as may be required by law enforcement personnel working in
an undercover capacity are not subject to normal purchasing
procedures. All such disbursements made shall be approved by the City
Manager and shall be documented by written vouchers showing date,
amount, nature of expenditure, signature of requesting officer or agent,
and approval of the Chief of Police.
F. Professional Services And Real Estate. Specifically excluded from the
provisions of the City's purchasing policy is the procurement of real
estate and professional services. Solicitation of professional services
shall comply with Missouri Revised Statutes.

required, or the person poses a danger to a victim, the community or
any other person. When such a determination is made, the Municipal
Judge may impose any combination of the following conditions of
release which will reasonably assure the appearance of the person
as required, taking into account available information, without regard

Municipal Judge or the Clerk of the Court by the officer approving and
taking the same.
F. If the person is not released or does not meet the conditions of release,
they shall be committed to jail until discharged by due course of law.
There shall be a presumption that releasing the person under any
conditions shall not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as

unlawfully present in the United States. If such presumption exists, the
person shall be committed to the County Jail until such person provides
verification of their lawful presence in the United States or otherwise
rebuts such presumption. If the person adequately proves their lawful
presence or otherwise rebuts such presumption, the Judge shall review
the issue of release, without regard to previous issues concerning
whether the person is lawfully present in the United States. If the
person cannot prove their lawful presence or otherwise rebut such
presumption, the person shall continue to be committed to the jail and
remain until discharged by due course of law.
A. Any person arrested and charged with violating any of the traffic
ordinances of the City may at the discretion of the officer authorized by

violating a traffic ordinance of the City may, if afforded the opportunity
to deposit his/her motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to this
Section in lieu of bail, decline to do so and instead post bail of fifty

subdivision, and shall have the same immunity as if acting within their
own jurisdiction.

No. 5096 §1, 2-17-2009; Ord. No. 5174 §1, 6-20-2011]
As used herein, the following terms shall have these prescribed meanings:
BOARD OF TRUSTEES — The Board provided for in this Article III to
establish policy and rules for the administration of the Fund.
FUND — The Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement Fund.
PLAN — The retirement plan established pursuant to this Article III.
RETIREMENT BASE PAY — The average base pay of the employee from
the City for the three (3) years prior to the date of such employee's death
or retirement, whichever occurs first. In cases of disability or death prior
to three (3) years' service, the retirement base pay shall be the average
base pay of the employee for the period of employment by the City. The
retirement base pay for pension benefits of retirees or survivors shall be
increased annually beginning July 1, 1987, by the percentage of average
per-member increase in base pay for the entire Police or Fire Department
during the previous fiscal year of the City. Such increase shall not occur
once the member reaches the age when said member qualifies for one
hundred percent (100%) of his/her Social Security retirement benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement base pay taken into account
in determining benefit accruals in any plan year shall not exceed the amount
set forth in Code Section 401(a)(17), as adjusted for cost of living increases
by the Secretary of the Treasury. (For 2010, $245,000.00; and for 2011,
$245,000.00). "Annual retirement base pay" means retirement base pay
during the plan year or such other consecutive twelve (12) month period
over which compensation is otherwise determined under this Article III
(hereinafter defined as the "determination period"). The cost of living
adjustment in effect on January first (1st) of any calendar year shall apply
to any determination period beginning in such calendar year. For this
purpose, the term "determination period" as used herein is any period not
exceeding twelve (12) months over which compensation is determined. If a
determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the Section
401(a)(17) limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of
which is twelve (12).
Compensation for purposes of determining retirement base pay for periods
of Qualified Military Service, as defined for purposes of the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA")
after December 12, 1994, shall be at the rate of compensation the employee

would have had thirty (30) years' service. Persons receiving the nonduty
disability benefit shall be required to report to the Board of

A. Annual Benefit.
1. Effective date. The limitations of this Section 200.460 apply in
"limitation years" beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as
otherwise provided herein.
2. Annual benefit. The "annual benefit" otherwise payable to a
participant under this Article III at any time shall not exceed the
"maximum permissible benefit".
3. Other rules applicable. The limitations of this Section 200.460 shall
be determined and applied taking into account the rules in
Subsection (C).
B. Definitions. For purposes of this Section 200.460, the following
definitions apply.
ANNUAL BENEFIT — A benefit that is payable annually in the form
of a "straight life annuity". Except as provided below, where a benefit
is payable in a form other than a "straight life annuity", the benefit
shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent "straight life annuity" that
begins at the same time as such other form of benefit and is payable on
the first (1st) day of each month, before applying the limitations of this
Section 200.460. For a participant who has or will have distributions
commencing at more than one (1) annuity starting date, the "annual
benefit" shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and
shall satisfy the limitations of this Section 200.460 as of each such
date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits
Section
200.440
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
200.460
AO:119
commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the
determination of whether a new annuity starting date has occurred
shall be made without regard to U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.415(b)1(b) (1)(iii)(B) and (C).
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for:
Survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified
joint and survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be
payable if the participant's benefit were paid in another form;
1.
Benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such
as a qualified disability benefit, pre-retirement incidental death
benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or
2.
The inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase
feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Code Section
417(e)(3) and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this Section
200.460, and this Article III provides that the amount payable
under the form of benefit in any "limitation year" shall not exceed
the limits of this Section 200.460 applicable at the annuity starting
date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section
415(d). For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is
included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for
automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.
The determination of the "annual benefit" shall take into
account Social Security supplements described in Code
Section 411(a)(9). Effective for distributions in plan years
beginning after December 31, 2003, the determination of
actuarial equivalence of forms of benefit other than a "straight
life annuity" shall be made in accordance with the following:
The "straight life annuity" that is actuarially equivalent to the
participant's form of benefit shall be determined hereunder if
the form of the participant's benefit is either:
1. A non-decreasing annuity (other than a "straight life
annuity") payable for a period of not less than the life of
the participant (or, in the case of a qualified pre-retirement
survivor annuity, the life of the surviving spouse), or
2. An annuity that decreases during the life of the participant
merely because of:
a. The death of the survivor annuitant (but only if the
reduction is not below fifty percent (50%) of the benefit
payable before the death of the survivor annuitant), or
b. The cessation or reduction of Social Security
supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined
in Code Section 401(a)(11)).

whichever of the following produces the greater
annual amount:
(a) The interest rate and mortality table (or other
tabular factor) used by this Article III for
adjusting benefits in the same form; and
(b) Five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and
the applicable mortality table as established by

July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent "straight life
annuity" is equal to the greater of:
(a) The annual amount of the "straight life annuity"
(if any) payable to the participant under this
Article III commencing at the same annuity
starting date as the participant's form of benefit;
and
(b) The annual amount of the "straight life annuity"
commencing at the same annuity starting date
that has the same actuarial present value as the

immediately commencing "straight life annuity" under
this Article III at the participant's annuity starting
date is the annual amount of such annuity payable
to the participant, computed disregarding the
participant's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but
including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial
adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the
adjusted immediately commencing "straight life

payable under this Article III to a hypothetical
participant who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same
accrued benefit as the participant.
Notwithstanding the other requirements of this definition, no
adjustment shall be made to the "defined benefit dollar
limitation" to reflect the probability of a participant's death
between the annuity starting date and age sixty-two (62), or
between age sixty-five (65) and the annuity starting date, as
applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the
participant prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent
benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting
date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no
forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the participant's

providing a qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity, as
defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the participant's death.

Military Service) provided under the plan as if the participant had
resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.
Moreover, the plan will credit the participant's Qualified Military

Section 415(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. Section 1.415(c)-2; and (iii) the plan
shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision
described in Code Section 414(u)(1)(C) by reason of any contribution or
benefit which is based on the differential wage payment. Differential
wage payments (as described herein) will also be considered
compensation for all plan purposes. Subsection (iii) applies only if all
employees of the City performing service in the uniformed services
described in Code Section 3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive
differential wage payments (as defined in Code Section 3401(h)(2)) on

permit; and
b. That the keeping and handling of chickens may cause health
hazards and that adequate health precautions are the
responsibility of the owner.

of notice of the variance application is sent to all adjoining property
owners. Requests for variances from the provisions of

consent by all adjacent property owners directly affected by any
encroachment.

discretion of the City Manager or his or her designee, an
investigation of any potential violations shall be made by the City
Manager or his or her designee. If the investigation substantiates
the existence of a violation of such conditions, a letter shall be sent
by regular mail to the property owner notifying the property owner
of such violation and that same shall be corrected within not less
than five (5) days and that such property owner shall be responsible
for notifying the City Manager or his or her designee by certified
mail, or other reasonable methods approved by the City Manager,
that such violations have been corrected and seeking a reinspection
to verify that such violations have been corrected. In the
event the property owner shall fail to notify the City Manager or his
or her designee of such correction within five (5) days or in the
event that a re-inspection does not verify such correction, the
permit shall be revoked.
C. Permit revocations under this Section may be appealed as follows:
1. Appeals must be filed within five (5) days after the revocation
notice is mailed by regular mail or other methods as designated by
the City Manager.

Chapter. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or
supersede, any other applicable buffer or floodplain requirements
established under State law and approval or exemption from these

Land Development Requirements
Section 243.300. Land Development Requirements. [Ord. No. 5075
§1, 7-2-2008]
A. Buffer And Setback Requirements. All land development activity
subject to this Chapter shall meet the following requirements:
1. For streams depicted as a solid blue line on the U.S.G.S. map, an
undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty
(50) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of
the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. For all
other streams subject to this Chapter, an undisturbed natural
vegetative buffer shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet,
measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream
as measured from the top of the stream bank.
2. An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet,
measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative
buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading,
filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
3. No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within
the buffer or the setback.
B. Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback
requirements may be granted in accordance with the following
provisions:
1. Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this
Chapter and its shape, topography or other existing physical
condition prevents land development consistent with this Chapter,
and the Richmond Heights Building Department finds and
determines that the requirements of this Chapter prohibit the
otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Board of
Adjustment of Richmond Heights may grant a variance from the
buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such
variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any
proposed land development on the parcel.
2. Except as provided above, the Board of Adjustment of Richmond
Heights shall grant no variance from any provision of this Chapter
without first conducting a public hearing on the application for
variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an
affirmative vote of the Board of Adjustment. The Board of
Adjustment shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation within Richmond Heights. The
Board of Adjustment shall require that a notice of the proposed
variance and the public hearing be sent to all property owners
within three hundred (300) feet of the subject parcel.

Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a. When a property's shape, topography or other physical
conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this Chapter
prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b. Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal
buffer requirements in the Chapter would create an extreme
hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following
adoption of this Chapter, actions of any property owner
of a given property have created conditions of a
hardship on that property.
3. At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following
information:
a. A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands,
floodplain boundaries and other natural features as
determined by field survey;
b. A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils,
vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c. A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and
proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of
all existing and proposed land disturbance both inside and
outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to
be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d. Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be
maintained;
e. At least one (1) alternative plan which does not include a buffer
or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan
is not possible;
f. A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed
intrusion;
g. A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
h. Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is
proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none
is being proposed.
4. The following factors will be considered in determining whether to
issue a variance:
a. The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other
physical characteristics of the property;

property boundaries;
c. The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback
intrusion;
d. Whether alternative designs are possible which require less
intrusion or no intrusion;
e. The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the
proposed variance; and
f. Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of
natural resources and the environment.
A. Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks
hereunder must include the following:
1. A site plan showing:

A. No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or required to be
registered in this State shall operate the vehicle, or authorize any other
person to operate the vehicle register or maintain registration of a
motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle, upon
the streets or the alleys of this City, unless the owner maintains the
financial responsibility as required in this Section which conforms to
the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the
owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such person
has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the
other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this
Subsection if he or she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a
motor vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall
mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in
any one (1) accident, and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury
to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident, and in the
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
C. Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
1. An insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer
or by the Director of Revenue of the State of Missouri for selfinsurance.
A motor vehicle liability insurance policy, a motor
vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the
name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the
named insured, the policy number, the effective dates of the policy
and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five
(5) digits of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if
the insurance policy covers five (5) or more motor vehicles shall be
satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
2. A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit
according to Section 303.240, RSMo.
3. A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.

Confiscation of False Evidence, Misdemeanor.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer
knowing there is no valid liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle
as required pursuant to this Article, or knowing the evidence of insurance is
illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance.
D. Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the
insured motor vehicle or by the operator of the motor vehicle if the
proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator rather
than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall
exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the
officer's or inspector's duties.
E. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the
operator demonstrates to the court that he or she met the financial
responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo. at the time the
peace officer wrote the citation.
F. Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of
an ordinance violation and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished
by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00) for each and every violation.
A. Whenever a court convicts a person of a violation of Section 303.025,
RSMo., or enters an order of court-ordered supervision, the Clerk of the
court shall within ten (10) days forward a report of the conviction or
order of supervision to the Director of Revenue in a form prescribed by
the Department of Revenue. In any case where the person charged with
the violation fails to appear in court, the procedures provided in Section

conventional zones; to encourage a more imaginative and innovative
Section
405.250
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.260
AO:571
design of projects; to promote a more desirable community
environment; and to retain maximum control over both the structure
and future operation of the development.
The City Council, upon receiving recommendations of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, may by ordinance authorize a Planned
Development District when the proposed development or use of a
specific tract of land or area warrants greater flexibility, control and
density than is afforded under the general regulations of standard
zoning districts. These planned development regulations are not
intended to allow excessive densities or the development of
incompatible land uses, either within the development or as the
development relates to the general neighborhood. The standards
contained in the following provisions must be strictly adhered to by the
applicant.
The City may, upon proper application, approve a planned development
for a site of at least two and one-half (2.5) acres to facilitate the use of
flexible techniques of land development and site design, by providing
relief from zone requirements designed for conventional developments
in order to obtain one (1) or more of the following objectives:
1. Environmental design in the development of land that is of a higher
quality than is possible under the regulations otherwise applicable
to the property.
2. Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the
relationship of uses, structures, open space and height of
structures in developments intended as cohesive, unified projects.
3. Functional and beneficial uses of open space areas.
4. Preservation of natural features of a development site.
5. Creation of a safe and desirable living environment for residential
areas characterized by a unified building and site development
program.
6. Rational and economic development in relation to public services.
7. Efficient and effective traffic circulation, both within and adjacent
to the development site.
B. Relationship Of Planned Development Districts To Zoning Map.
1. A mapped district. The "PD" designation is not intended to be
attached to existing use districts as an overlay.
2. Plan approval required. Although the "PD" designation may be
applied to parcels of land as a mapped zoning district, it is the
intent of this Chapter that no development or redevelopment of the
property encompassed by the "PD" designation take place until an
acceptable development plan has been reviewed and approved in

uses within the area encompassed by the "PD" designation
shall have the status of non-conforming uses, as outlined in Section
405.380 until such time as they are included in an approved
development plan.
3. Types of planned developments. All areas of the City subject to the
"PD" designation shall be assigned one (1) of the following
subclassifications which shall be considered a separate use district
and subject to the specific restrictions and limitations outlined in
this Section.

months each upon written request of the original applicant if
the application submitted is substantially the same as the
initially approved application. However, the City Council has
the power in such cases to attach new conditions to approval.
At such time as the period of validity of an approved final
development plan lapses, the final development plan and all
uses, terms and conditions thereof shall be considered null and
void. No further development of the site shall be permitted
except by application in accordance with the procedural
requirements of this Section, whereby it shall be considered an
entirely new application.
c. Should a request for extension of an approved final
development plan contain substantial changes, as determined
by the Council, the Council shall require the applicant to refile
his/her application subject to the requirements of this Section
as if it were an entirely new application.

A. Definition — Overlay Districts. Overlay districts are special zones
placed "on top" of existing zoning and planning regulations. An overlay
district provides specific regulations and/or relief from the City's zoning
requirements for a specific area. This approach allows the City to
maintain the current zoning ordinance while addressing the special
needs of a targeted area. Overlay districts are common zoning tools
used to help revitalize downtowns, aging commercial areas or a
particular corridor without making extensive amendments to the zoning
ordinance.
B. Petition For An "MU" Overlay District Approval. A petition for rezoning
to a "MU" Overlay District shall include the following:
1. A fully executed change in zoning petition signed by the property
owner(s) identified by the current deed with all required
information and accompanying documentation.
2. A copy of the current deed(s) for the property(ies) involved.
3. The legal description(s) of all properties to be encompassed in said
district.
4. Evidence of unified ownership or control by the petitioner of all
properties encompassed in said petition, if there is more than one
(1) owner.
5. Statement of petitioner's experience and background in real estate
development and residential or commercial construction.
6. A refundable review fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Fee is to
defray review costs by the City or its consultants. Any portion not
used may be refunded or applied to a building permit fee.
7. A preliminary site development plan measuring no more than
twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches and bearing the
seal and signature of a licensed professional engineer, surveyor,
landscape architect or architect. The site development plan shall
include the following information:
a. The number, type(s), use, height and dimensions of all
proposed buildings.
b. Provisions for stormwater control and drainage including preand
post-development drainage maps (including contributory
off-site drainage), detention and clean water facilities including
preliminary capacity computations, storm water pollution
prevention plan and other information and documentation as
required in the City's stormwater ordinance.
Section
405.265
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
405.265
AO:582
c. A pre- and post development grading plan with topographic
intervals at no greater than two (2) feet and extending one
hundred (100) feet beyond the perimeter of the subject site.
d. The number of dwelling units contemplated.
e. The total floor area by floor of all buildings.
f. Preliminary utility locations.
g. The outboundaries, bearings and dimensions of the property
described in the legal description with respect to the
surrounding community.
h. The locations and improvements of all streets and properties
complete with dimensions and ownership information within
one hundred (100) feet from the perimeter of the site.
i. A computation of the total land area in square feet and as a
percentage of the entire site used for buildings, roadways,
other pavements, recreation, landscape/green space and other
major land uses.
j. A preliminary architectural elevation showing all sides of all
buildings with dimensions, materials, colors and architectural
treatments.
k. Locations of all vehicular service entrances, parking areas,
loading areas, refuse containers, ground-mounted utilities,
HVAC, etc.
l. Other information as may be reasonably necessary to
understand the character, scope and impact of a development
proposal.
C. "MU" Overlay District Petition Review Procedure. Rezoning to the "MU"
Overlay District is initiated by a petition submitted by a person(s) or
entity with a valid and demonstrable legal interest in the lots or tracts
of land involved with the petition. The procedures for application,
review and approval shall be as follows:
1. A petition shall be submitted to the City that consists of the
application form available from the City and the required
information, documents and submittal information as set forth
above in Subsection (B).
2. The petition shall be reviewed for compliance with the minimum
submittal requirements and provisions of the applicable ordinances
of the City. If the petition is properly submitted and in compliance
with the minimum submittal requirements, the City shall advertise
the public hearing and place the petition on an upcoming agenda of
the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration.

thirty (30) day period, the petition shall be deemed to have been
properly submitted and shall be advertised for public hearing and
placed on an upcoming agenda of the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
5. Initially, only one (1) copy of the petition documents must be
submitted. After submission is determined to be in compliance with
the minimum submittal requirements, twenty-five (25) sets of the
folded plans, drawings and other documents on paper not
exceeding twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches must be
submitted.
6. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing
for all "MU" Overlay District rezoning petitions. The procedures
and requirements shall be the same as required for changes and
amendments to the zoning regulations pursuant to Section 405.580
of the City's Zoning Code.
7. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the petition for
consistency with the general guidance of the goals, policies and
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan, compliance with the
"MU" Overlay requirements and other applicable Zoning Code
requirements and consider the comments and testimony from the
petitioner's presentation, the public hearing, the petition review
report and make findings accordingly. The findings should then be
submitted, in writing, to the City Council.
8. The petition and the findings of the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall be placed on the next available Council agenda
for approval.
D. Final "MU" Overlay Zoning District Approval.
1. The "MU" Overlay District shall be approved by ordinance by the
City Council. The governing ordinance approving the "MU" Overlay
shall approve the site development plan and set forth the permitted
use(s), building bulk, setback and density limits and other
restrictions or limitations to the uses and requirements of the
underlying zoning districts. The overlay district is intended to set
the general development parameters and conditions upon which
permits for grading and construction are contingent.
2. Minor changes and adjustments to the approved site development
plan may be made without subsequent Planning and Zoning
Commission or Council approval as long as such changes are within
Section
405.265
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
405.265
AO:584
the scope of the provisions of the approving ordinance. The City
shall be responsible for determining if proposed changes are within
said scope or constitute a substantial deviation from the ordinance.
3. Upon final approval of a fully engineered final site development
plan by the City of Richmond Heights and all agencies with
jurisdiction over the site, the petitioner shall provide mylar copies
for recording and four (4) paper copies and a digital copy on DVD
or CD of the final site plan for the City's records.
4. No building permit shall be issued for any structure in the "MU"
Overlay District that does not conform to the final site development
plan and governing ordinance as approved by the City Council.
E. When Underlying Regulations Apply. The governing ordinance shall
specify site development regulations. Where the governing ordinance is
silent on such matters, the underlying zoning district and development
regulations will control.
F. "MU" Overlay Zoning District Amendment. The owner of any tract of
land or project for which a "MU" Overlay District governing ordinance
has been approved by the City Council, who desires to make a change
that is a substantial deviation from the ordinance, may petition for a
"MU" ordinance amendment in accordance with the petitioning
procedures established for approving the original petition as
established in this Section.
G. Shared Parking Recommendations. Shared parking is encouraged
whenever adjacent uses have varying hours of operation. All requests
for shared parking must be included in the "MU" rezoning petition. The
final arrangement and shared parking configuration shall be approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. The burden
should be placed on the petitioner to demonstrate how the shared
parking arrangement will work. Applicants shall submit a shared
parking feasibility study to identify the number of shared parking
spaces needed and solutions to avoid any major conflict between the
operating hours of the uses that share parking. Finally, an agreement,
executed by the all parties involved, stating the terms and conditions of
the shared parking arrangement shall be provided at the time of the
"MU" Overlay approval.
H. Designated overlay districts and their specifics — Dale Avenue mixed
use overlay district: For the purposes of Dale Avenue, the locations of
the overlay were centered at roadway intersections (aka nodes) where
non-residential uses were already established. The mapped boundaries
of the overlay district are shown on the future land use plan. Please
note, the boundaries of overlay districts do not necessarily coincide
with other zoning district, parcel lines or right-of-way boundaries.
1. Purpose. The purpose of the Dale Avenue Mixed Use Overlay
District ("MU") is to implement the guidelines established in the
2008 Dale Avenue Future Land Use Plan adopted as part of the
Section
405.265
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.265
AO:585
City's Comprehensive Plan. The "MU" Overlay District promotes
development that provides a blend of retail, commercial service,
office and residential activities that help preserve and enhance the
underutilized or aging commercial or mixed use areas along Dale
Avenue.
2. Intent. The intent of the Dale Avenue "MU" District is to allow the
development of land that is consistent with the City's
Comprehensive Plan and to promote the following development
objectives:
a. Allow flexibility in the utilization of land use regulations by
allowing greater variety and market responsiveness in the site
design, the arrangement of site improvements, building
locations and land uses. This may include a wavier, approved
by the City Council for any modifications to the underlying
district regulations provided the development is consistent
with the stated purpose provided in Subsection (G)(1)(a).
b. To provide minimum standards for design that establishes an
acceptable level of continuity between existing and proposed
development and preserves the scale and character of the
buildings, homes and transportation network along Dale
Avenue.
c. Promote the installation of pedestrian features and encourage
walking and biking as an alternative to vehicular travel.
3. When required. The Dale Avenue Mixed Use Overlay District
applies to any new use or change in use located in an area
identified on the Dale Avenue future land use map as "mixed use
overlay" with the following exceptions:
a. New additions to legally existing structures provided no
waivers or modification to any underlying zoning district or
other regulation is needed.
b. The change is not detrimental to the neighboring properties or
community, does not materially alter or impact traffic, public
improvements or public financial burdens, and is otherwise
consistent with all established City plans, policies and
ordinances.
4. Permitted uses. All uses permitted in the underlying district are
permitted within the Dale Avenue "MU" District with the following
exceptions:
a. New uses or changes in use of an existing building are
permitted, provided the proposed use is permitted in the
underlying zoning district and does not otherwise detract from
the character of the Dale Avenue corridor.
Section
405.265
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
405.265
AO:586
b. All ground floor uses of a non-residential or mixed-use building
must be retail, restaurant or commercial service in nature for
seventy-five percent (75%) of the floor area and one hundred
percent (100%) of the frontage of the building. All other
ground floor uses permitted shall be limited to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total ground floor area and shall not be
located in the front of the building, which includes any building
face that fronts a street.
c. Dwellings located above the ground floor shall be permitted by
right (i.e. without a conditional use permit), subject to the
following:
(1) There shall be no limit on the maximum number of units
other than the limits imposed by the building size or unit
size requirements.
(2) The average dwelling size shall not be less than nine
hundred (900) square feet per unit and no unit shall be less
than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet.
5. Building bulk regulations.
a. Structure height. The minimum building height for any nonresidential
or mixed use structure shall be two (2) stories. No
structure shall exceed three (3) stories or forty-five (45) feet,
whichever is less, unless approved by the Planning
Commission.
b. Maximum site coverage. There is no maximum site coverage
limitation in the "MU" Overlay District; however, each site shall
contribute street plantings, street lighting and other
pedestrian amenities as approved by the Planning Commission.
c. Maximum square footage. New development or expansions to
an existing building should not result in a gross floor area over
ten thousand (10,000) square feet.
6. Setbacks.
a. Front. The required front setback is a maximum of ten (10)
feet. This is intended to provide public space in the form of
sidewalks, plaza areas and landscaping between the street and
the building. The maximum front yard setback may be modified
or waived by the Planning Commission upon approval of the
site development plan depicting the proposed setback
modifications.
b. Rear. The minimum rear setback shall be thirty (30) feet. The
setback may be reduced to fifteen (15) feet if a functioning
alley is present and provides secondary access.
Section
405.265
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.265
AO:587
c. Side. There are no minimum or maximum side setback
requirements, except where a site abuts a residentially zoned
property, in which case the minimum side setback should be
the same as required in the underlying zoning district of said
abutting residential district.
7. Vehicle and driveway access. No additional curb cuts along Dale
Avenue should be allowed for lots that are already served by a
driveway off Dale Avenue. Lots that front Big Bend or Hanley Road
are subject to St. Louis County's access standards. All future
development should provide public right-of-way improvements as
needed for safe, convenient vehicular and pedestrian accessibility.
8. Off-street parking.
a. No off-street parking requirement is required for nonresidential
uses, unless the use exceeds one thousand (1,000)
square feet of gross floor area, in which case off-street parking
is required for all uses with a floor area in excess of one
thousand (1,000) square feet at a ratio of five (5) stalls per one
thousand (1,000) square feet of finished floor area.
Additionally, one (1) off-street parking space is required for
each residential dwelling unit.
b. The purpose of exempting certain uses from compliance with
the City's existing off-street parking requirements and allowing
shared parking (see below) is to incentivize the revitalization of
the City's commercial nodal areas along Dale Avenue.
Reducing and consolidating parking also helps maintain the
area's traditional neighborhood character. The rationale for
recommending relief from the City's conventional parking
requirements is based on the fact the commercial nodal areas
are served by on-street parking and are close to residential
neighborhoods, the Heights, MetroLink and other destinations
that increase the likelihood people will make more trips on foot
or bicycle, thus reducing the demand for off-street parking. To
ensure parking blends with the existing character of Dale
Avenue, the following parking standards are required for all
new uses or changes to an existing use:
(1) On-street parking should be utilized where site design and
traffic patterns permit.
(2) Off-street parking spaces should be located to the rear of
the principal building or screened, landscaped and/or
buffered to minimize visibility from major rights-of-way,
residential units and adjoining properties. All parking
structures shall be architecturally compatible with the
adjacent buildings.
Section
405.265
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
405.265
AO:588
(3) Perimeter landscape buffers and curbed planting islands
shall be required for all parking lots with five (5) or more
spaces.
(4) All parking lots shall be screened from public streets and
sidewalks, public open spaces and adjacent properties by
complying with one (1) of the following landscaping
options, and a two (2) foot car overhang area shall be
provided in any planting area adjacent to parking stalls not
intended for parallel parking.
(a) The outside perimeter of all parking areas and drive
aisles should include a landscaped area between five
(5) to twelve (12) feet in width offering a mixture of
deciduous trees, evergreen trees and shrubs.
(b) A three (3) to five (5) foot wide perimeter-landscaped
area with metal ornamental fencing or a masonry wall
supplemented with clusters of shrubs or a continuous
hedge row interspersed with deciduous or evergreen
trees.
(5) All planting areas within or adjacent to a parking lot or
vehicular use area should include in-ground irrigation.
(6) Unless part of a rain garden or similar runoff collection
system, all landscaped areas shall be delineated by a
vertical concrete curb.
(7) The use of low impact development techniques is
encouraged. Low impact development (LID) includes, but
is not limited to, the use of permeable pavers, indigenous
landscaping, rain gardens, etc.
9. Shared parking recommendations. Shared parking is encouraged
whenever adjacent uses have varying hours of operation. All
requests for shared parking must be included in the "MU" rezoning
petition. The final arrangement and shared parking configuration
shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Council. The burden should be placed on the petitioner to
demonstrate how the shared parking arrangement will work.
Applicants shall submit a shared parking feasibility study to
identify the number of shared parking spaces needed and solutions
to avoid any major conflict between the operating hours of the uses
that share parking. Finally, an agreement, executed by the all
parties involved, stating the terms and conditions of the shared
parking arrangement shall be provided at the time of the "MU"
Overlay approval.
10. Design guidelines. The intent of the following architectural design
guidelines is to ensure that major alterations to existing structures
Section
405.265
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.265
AO:589
and the construction of new buildings are compatible with the
established design, scale and general character of Dale Avenue.
a. Architectural continuity. New buildings and additions to
existing buildings shall relate to the other buildings on the
street in regards to the material and color of the wall and roof,
the type and slope of the roof and the proportion of the
fenestration (i.e., windows and doors).
b. Articulation. Designs should utilize massing offsets and
shadow lines to help articulate or break up large expanses of
unadorned facades. Architectural details used to articulate the
structure may include changes in the building plane (off-sets),
columns, balconies and other three-dimensional details that
create shadow lines and break up the flat surfaces of the
facade.
c. Roof and eaves. Roof line offsets and changes in plane should
be used to create architectural interest and variety to the
massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single, long
roof. The use of eaves, alternating dormers, stepped roofs,
gables or other roof elements should be used to add visual
relief and physical articulation to the overall facade. Flatroofed
designs should include architectural details such as
cornices and decorative eaves to provide interest to the roof
line.
d. Window and entryway treatments. Decorative lintels, sills,
glazing, door design, moldings or framing details should be
used on windows and entryways located on facades facing or
adjacent to public streets to create architectural interest and
enhance the pedestrian realm.
(1) Primary building entries should be parallel to the front
property line and include a stylized entryway such as a
recessed entrance, an extruded entrance, truncated
corner entryway or other design that creates an enhanced
sense of entry.
(2) Building frontages and sides of buildings oriented to the
street should incorporate a combination of awnings,
building-mounted lighting, pedestrian level display
windows, storefronts and entrances.
(3) Upper story windows should be vertically aligned with the
location of windows and doors on the ground level,
including storefront or display windows.
e. Building materials. The use of external insulating finishing
system ("EIFS"), corrugated metal, aluminum siding and vinyl
siding should be limited to accent features only. EIFS and vinyl
siding should not be used on the bottom four (4) feet of the
Section
405.265
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
405.265
AO:590
building facade or other areas where it could be easily
damaged by yard equipment or constant contact by vegetation
or pedestrians. The use of highly reflective or glossy materials
or coatings should be limited to building accents only.
f. Awnings and canopies. Non-residential buildings should have
an awning or canopy over building entrances that abut a public
right-of-way. Awnings emphasize a store or restaurant's
entrance, provides shade and weather protection, adds texture
to the streetscape and adds interest and variety to the building
facade.
g. Height. Taller buildings should step down to provide a height
transition to existing single-story buildings.
11. Outdoor seating.
a. Outdoor seating areas must be accommodated on site and shall
not conflict or otherwise interfere with the operation of
neighboring uses. Businesses requesting seating areas located
off site shall file an agreement at City Hall executed by all
applicable parties.
b. No live music shall be permitted without a special event permit
approved by the City for any outdoor seating area.
c. Clear and unobstructed walkways shall be provided to allow
access to all tables within an outdoor seating area during
operating hours. All ingress, egress and walkways accessing
the tables shall be in compliance with ADA.
d. Use of an outdoor seating area shall not extend past 10:00
P.M., unless specifically authorized by the City.
e. The serving of any alcoholic beverage in an outdoor seating
environment shall require a conditional use permit.
f. In addition to the minimum parking stalls required to
accommodate the maximum indoor seating capacity, parking
shall be provided for the maximum capacity of patrons the
outdoor seating area can accommodate.
12. Signs. Mixed use development proposals shall include a sign
package illustrating the design, placement and size of all signage.
No signage shall obstruct any public right-of-way, including
pedestrian pathways, or introduce visual clutter to the streetscape.
All signage shall comply with the underlying sign requirements and
reinforce the pedestrian scale and character of the Dale Avenue
corridor. All signage shall be approved by the Planning
Commission.

7. Any exterior mounted satellite dish-type antenna used to receive or
transmit television, radio or other electronic signals shall be
subject to the following requirements and shall be permitted only
upon compliance with them:
a. Definition. As used herein, the term "satellite dish-type
antenna" shall mean any device incorporating a reflective
surface that is solid, open mesh, or bar configured and is in the
shape of a shallow dish, cone, horn, cornucopia or flat plate,
which is used or may be used to receive or transmit television
signals, radio or electromagnetic waves between terrestrially
and/or orbitally based units. This definition is meant to include,
but not be limited to, what are commonly referred to as
satellite earth stations, satellite receivers, satellite discs,
satellite dishes, direct broadcast systems (DBSs), television
reception only systems (TVROs), and satellite microwave
antennas.
b. Building permit requirements. A building permit shall be
required for any satellite dish-type antenna, and such permit
shall conform to the following standards and criteria:
Section
405.270
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.270
AO:595
(1) No such antenna may be erected or maintained which is
larger than six (6) feet in any linear dimension or which
has any part more than eight (8) feet in height above
ground level.
(2) No more than one (1) such antenna may be located upon
any building lot, except for commercial and industrial lots
in the "C-1", "C-2", "PD-MxD" and "PD-C" Districts.
(3) In any residential zones, the antenna installation shall be
groundmounted and shall be located only in the buildable
area of a rear yard of a lot and not in the required setback
areas of the lot, and in no case closer than eight (8) feet
from any property line. In the case of the "R-5" Multi-
Family District, one (1) master receiving antenna may be
permitted to service the entire development at any
location subject to the approval of the City Council. Roofmounting
of antennas shall be permitted upon commercial

are neither bright nor metallic.
(6) All satellite dish-type antennas shall be screened from
view from the public and private streets or otherwise
located on the building lot area in such a manner as to
eliminate their visibility from the public and private
streets. Screening materials may consist of such items as
walls, fences, buildings, mature plant materials or earth
berms, if and to the extent such items are otherwise
permitted under this Chapter. Screening shall not be
required to the extent it would block incoming reception or
outgoing transmission signals from the antenna in
question.
(7) No advertising in any form shall be permitted on any part
of the satellite dish-type antenna, except for a six (6) inch

permit and satellite dish approval pursuant hereto shall
include a dimensioned site plan depicting the proposed
location, adjacent properties, screening provisions, and the
manufacturer's and installer's installation requirements and
product specifications; a drawing or picture of the proposed
antenna with all its pertinent dimensions; and a drawing of the
proposed method of installation, including footings and base
supports. The building permit official for the City may require
any additional information from the applicant which would
assist in determining visual intrusion, signal reception or
transmission requirements and structural safety.
e. Additional requirements. In addition to the aforementioned
construction performance standards, the construction and
installation of each satellite dish-type antenna shall conform to
all requirements of the City of Richmond Heights's adopted
Building and Electrical Codes.
f. Variances for signal requirements. Applicants may request
variances from the requirements of this Chapter where and to
the extent necessary to obtain reasonable satellite signal
transmission or reception. Said request for variances shall be
heard by an administrative review board consisting of the
Building Commissioner, Zoning Administrator and City
Manager. Applicants shall submit any information required by
Section
405.270
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section

the administrative review board to substantiate the need for a
variance.
C. Visibility At Intersections. On a corner lot in any district, development
shall conform to the requirements of the sight triangle in which nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as
to materially impede vision between a height of two (2) feet and eight
(8) feet above the grades at the back of the curb of the intersecting
streets, within the triangular area formed by the right-of-way lines and
a line connecting them at points thirty (30) feet from their point of
intersection or at equivalent points on private streets, except that the
sight triangle shall be increased for certain uses when deemed
necessary for traffic safety by the City Council.
D. General Bulk Regulations.
1. Continued conformity. No legally required yards, courts, other open
space or minimum lot area allocated to any structure shall, by
virtue of change of ownership or for any other reason, be used to
satisfy yards, courts, legally required parking areas, other open
spaces or minimum lot area requirements for any other structure,
and there shall be no permitted obstructions in required yards
except as otherwise set forth herein.

For every use, activity or structure permitted by this Chapter and for
all buildings or structures erected in accordance herewith, there shall
be provided sufficient space for access and off-street standing, parking,
circulation, unloading and loading of motor vehicles that may be expected
to transport their occupants, whether as patrons, residents, customers,
employees, guests or otherwise, to an establishment, activity or place of
residence at any time under normal conditions for any purpose. When a
use is expanded, accessory off-street parking and loading shall be provided
in accordance with the regulations herein for the area or capacity of such
expansion in combination with the previously existing use, structure or
activity.
Section 405.310. Administrative Requirements. [Ord. No. 4238
§2(501.2), 10-3-1988]
A. Determination Of Required Number Of Spaces.
1. Fractional spaces. When determination of the number of off-street
parking spaces required by this regulation results in a requirement
of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half (½) less may be
disregarded, and a fraction in excess of one-half (½) shall be
counted as one (1) parking space.
2. Floor area. "Floor area", when used as a measurement for
determining the number of parking spaces for office,
merchandising or service uses, shall mean the gross floor area
used, or intended to be used, for service to the public as patrons or
patients, including areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used
for display or sale of merchandise. It shall not include areas used
principally for non-public purposes such as storage, processing or
packaging of merchandise, show windows, or rest rooms or
utilities, dressing, fitting or alteration rooms.
B. Parking For Multiple Use Buildings. The number of parking spaces
required for land or buildings used for two (2) or more purposes shall
be the sum of the requirements for the various uses, computed in
accordance with this Chapter. Parking facilities for one (1) use shall not
be considered as providing the required parking facilities for any other
use, except where shared parking provisions may be demonstrated in
accordance with Section 405.330(H).
C. Use Of Required Parking Spaces. Required accessory off-street parking
facilities provided for the uses hereinafter listed shall be solely for the
parking of motor vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants
or employees of such uses and shall not be used for the storage of other
vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile homes or materials. All

off-street vehicles shall be parked only on required accessory off-street
parking facilities.
D. Accessory Parking Lots. All required off-street parking or loading
spaces shall be provided on the same parcel of land occupied by the use
or building to which it is appurtenant; provided however, that where
there are, in the judgment of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
practical difficulties in satisfying the requirement for parking space
and/or if the public safety or convenience would be better served by
another location, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend authorization of an alternate location for any portion of the
required parking for a non-residential use which will adequately serve
the public interest, subject to the following conditions:
1. Required accessory off-street parking facilities may be provided
elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is
located, provided that the property occupied as parking is in the
same possession, either by deed, by easement, or by long-term
lease which has a term equal to or exceeding the projected life of
the facility occupied by the principal use, and further provided that
the owner shall be bound by covenants filed on record in the office
of the County Recorder requiring the owners, heirs or assigns to
maintain the required number of off-street parking spaces during
the existence of such principal use.
2. Pedestrian access shall be available within a walking distance of
not more than three hundred (300) feet measured from the nearest
point of public access to the building to the nearest part of the
accessory parking area.
3. Such separate parking space shall be usable without causing
unreasonable traffic congestion, detriment to any residential
neighborhood or hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic.
4. All accessory parking lots shall be located on property zoned within
the same or similar zoning district.
E. Changes In Use. No off-street parking space required under this
Chapter shall be used for any other purpose. Where a change in use
creates greater parking requirements than the amount being provided,
an occupancy permit shall not be issued until provision is made for the
increased amount of required off-street parking.
F. Additions To Structures, Buildings Or Uses. Where an addition is made
to an existing structure, building or use which does not comply with the
parking requirements cited for such structure, building or use, the
parking requirements supplied for the addition shall include those
spaces necessary to bring the structure, building or use as a whole into
conformance with the requirements of this Chapter.
G. Existing Parking. No parking area or parking space which exists at the
time this Chapter becomes effective (October 3, 1988) or which

employee on maximum shift, plus one (1) space for every two (2)
inpatients, plus one (1) parking space for each vehicle used directly
in the conduct of such facility, plus five (5) spaces per one thousand
(1,000) square feet of floor space if used for out-patient treatment.
G. Other Uses. The Zoning Administrator shall determine to which of the
preceding categories of parking regulations any unlisted use belongs.
H. Shared Parking.
1. Notwithstanding the parking requirements set out in Article VI of
this Chapter, the number of required parking spaces may be
reduced if a developer demonstrates that the proposed use is
designed and located so that shared parking within the proposed
development or within adjacent development meets the minimum
standards of this Section.
2. Calculation of shared parking. The number of required parking
spaces for a proposed development to be used on a shared basis
shall be calculated in accordance with the methodologies as
established in the Urban Land Institute (ULI) study entitled
"Shared Parking" (ULI Catalog No. S22). The calculation basis is
generally set forth as follows (but should not be considered allinclusive
or as a substitute for the ULI methodologies):
a. The square footage of each land use in the proposed shared
parking development shall be identified, together with a
description of anticipated hours of operation of each use.
b. The peak parking demand for each land use in the proposed
shared parking development shall be calculated on the basis of
seasonally adjusted peak demand with a reduction for:
(1) Alternative mode factor based on existing or projected
community transportation mode use conditions; and
(2) Captive market adjustment, if data is available on which to
estimate the captive market factor.
(3) Peak parking demand shall be employed to establish
hourly accumulation curves for the proposed shared
parking development.
(4) The hourly accumulation curves shall be cumulated to
establish the overall required parking spaces for the
proposed shared parking development.

the specifications for stormwater drainage specified herein.
2. Examples of detention approaches are: rooftop detention, parking
lot detention, dry ponds, etc.
A. Applicability. All uses shall be constructed, maintained and operated so
as to not be injurious or offensive to the occupants of adjacent premises
by reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration, smoke, dirt, or
other particulate matter, toxic or noxious waste materials, odors, fire,
and explosive hazard or glare.
B. Administration And Enforcement.
1. Whenever, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, there is a
reasonable probability that any use or occupancy violates these
standards, he/she shall give written notice of at least seven (7)
days' duration that said use or occupancy must be corrected. In
case of an emergency, he/she may take immediate action deemed
appropriate to correct the violations. He/she is hereby authorized
to employ a qualified technician or technicians to perform whatever
investigations and analyses are necessary to determine whether
they are in fact being violated.

violation actually exists, the Zoning Administrator may, as a
condition precedent to further investigation, require that the
complainant post an escrow deposit in the amount of two hundred
dollars ($200.00) to defray the cost of employing a qualified
technician or technicians to perform such investigations and
analyses as may be necessary to determine whether such violation
exists.
a. In the event that the complaint is substantiated, the escrow
deposit shall be refunded to the depositor, and the reasonable
fees associated with the investigation and analyses shall be
recovered in the manner provided above.
b. If the complaint proves unfounded, such fees shall be paid from
the complainant's escrow deposit. Any remainder of such
deposit shall be refunded to the complainant upon completion
of the investigation.
4. Noise. Every use shall be so operated in compliance with Section
215.380 concerning Noise Regulations.

inherently and recurrently generated is not perceptible without
instruments at any point on the property line of the property on
which the use is located.
6. Dust, dirt and other matter. Every use shall be so operated as to
prevent the emission into the air of dust, dirt, noxious acids, fumes,
gases, and other particulate matter, whatever its source, which
may cause damage to property and health of persons at or beyond
the lot line of the property on which the use is located.
7. Smoke and particulate matter. No operation or use in the City of
Richmond Heights shall cause, create or allow the emission for
more than three (3) minutes in any one (1) hour of air contaminants
which at the emission point or within the property are:
a. As dark or darker in shade as that designated No. 2 on the
Ringleman Chart as published by the United States Bureau of
Mines Information Circular No. 7118.
b. Of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree
equal to or greater than the smoke or contaminants in the
standard prescribed in No. 1 above except that when the
presence of uncombined water is the only reason for failure to
comply or when such contaminants are emitted inside a

Non-Conforming Uses
Section 405.380. Non-Conforming Uses — Procedures. [Ord. No.
4238 §2(604.0), 10-3-1988; Ord. No. 4269 §1, 4-17-1989; Ord. No.
4313 §4, 3-5-1990; Ord. No. 4890 §2, 3-1-2004]
A. Scope Of Provisions. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all
non-conforming uses of land, including structures and the use thereof.
A non-conforming use is one which existed lawfully, whether by
variance or otherwise, on the date this Chapter (October 3, 1988) or
any amendment thereto became effective and which, at that time, failed
to conform to one (1) or more of the applicable regulations of this
Chapter or such amendment thereto. Non-conforming uses are
incompatible with and detrimental to permitted land uses and
structures in the zoning districts in which they are situated; inhibit
present and future development of nearby properties; and confer upon
their owners and users a position of unfair advantage. The existence of
a non-conforming use shall be a question of fact which shall be decided
by the Zoning Administrator.
B. Statement Of Intent. Non-conforming uses are not to be expanded and
they should be eliminated or reduced to conformity as quickly as the
fair interests of the parties will permit.
C. Non-Conforming Uses May Be Continued — When. If, on the date of
adoption or amendment of this Chapter (October 3, 1988) a lawful use
of a parcel or lot, including a building or structure and the use thereof,
exists that is no longer permissible under the provisions of this Chapter
or, in the case of a building or structure, that could not be built under
the regulations of this Chapter by reason of restrictions upon lot area,
lot width, lot coverage, height, open spaces, off-street parking, loading
spaces or setback, or other characteristics, such use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
1. Enlargement. No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged,
expanded, altered or changed so as to occupy a greater area of land
than was occupied on the date of adoption or amendment of this
Chapter and no additional accessory use, building or structure
shall be established unless the non-conformity be eliminated,
except that lawfully established residential dwellings and private
garages, which are non-conforming due only to the yard setback or
minimum lot size requirements of this Chapter, may be enlarged,
expanded, extended or altered as long as the change is otherwise
permissible under this Chapter. In no case shall a greater
percentage of a residential lot be developed with structures than is
allowed for conforming lots. A one- or two-family dwelling, which
was lawfully constructed observing a side yard setback less than
that which is required under the current zoning designation, may
be expanded provided the expansion along the non-conforming side
Section
405.380
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.380
AO:623
yard follows the existing building's established side yard setback;
further, the height of the addition shall not exceed the height of the
existing building and shall have a roof line which is compatible to
the existing structure.
2. Relocation. No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or
in part to any other portion of such parcel or lot not so occupied on
the date of adoption of this Chapter, or an amendment thereto, or to
a parcel or lot not in conformance with this Chapter. A nonconforming
use of a structure shall not be moved to any part of the
structure not manifestly arranged and designed for such use and so
occupied on the date of adoption of this Chapter (October 3, 1988)
or an amendment thereto.
3. Change in use not permitted. An existing non-conforming use shall
not cause further departures from this Chapter. Although an
existing non-conforming use may be continued, except as herein
limited, it may not be changed to another use except to a use
permitted in the district in which it is situated and provided it
complies with the requirements of that district.
4. Discontinuance. Except as stated in Subsection (D), if such nonconforming
use ceases for any reason for a period of more than one
(1) year (except where government action causes such cessation),
the subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the
regulations and provisions set by this Chapter for the district in
which such parcel or lot is located.
D. Repairs And Maintenance — When. Nothing in this Chapter shall be
deemed to prohibit the restoration of any structure and its use where
such structure has been destroyed by any means out of the control of
the owner to an extent less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement
value (excluding the value of the land, the cost of preparation of land,
and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use) at the
time of destruction, provided the restoration of such structure and its
use in no way increases any former non-conformity, and provided
further that restoration of such structure is begun within six (6) months
of such destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion within
two (2) years following such destruction. Whenever such structure has
been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an
extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value
(excluding the value of the land, the cost of preparation of land and the
value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use) at the time of
destruction, as determined by the Code Enforcement Officer, or by any
means within the control of the owner to any extent whatsoever, the
structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with all
regulations of the district in which such structure is situated. When a
structure is determined to be substandard by the proper administrative
official of the City of Richmond Heights under any applicable ordinance
of the City and the cost of placing the structure in condition to satisfy
the standards of such ordinance shall exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
Section
405.380
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
405.380
AO:624
reconstruction cost of the entire structure, such non-conforming
structure shall not be restored for the purpose of continuing a nonconforming
use. However, none of the restrictions contained in this
Section shall limit the authority of the Board of Adjustment to grant
relief for reconstruction of a non-conforming structure, as provided in
Article XII of this Chapter.
E. Change Of Tenancy Or Ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership or management of an existing non-conforming use, provided
there is no change in the nature or character, extent or intensity of such
non-conforming use.
F. Completion Of Pending Construction And Building Permits. To avoid
undue hardships, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to require a
change in plans, construction or designated use of any building to
which a building permit has been issued, plans or final subdivision plats
have been approved by the Commission, or on which actual
construction was lawfully begun, and has been carried on diligently,
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
However, all such uses, buildings and structures shall remain subject to
the provisions of this Section which limit the ability to continue a nonconforming
use.
G. Conditional Uses. Any use existing at the time of adoption of this
Chapter and which is lawfully permitted as a conditional use in a
district under the terms of this Chapter shall be deemed a conforming
use in such district.
H. Substandard Non-Conforming Lots Of Record. In any district in which
single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Chapter, a single-family dwelling
and customary accessory buildings or structures may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to
meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. If
two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this Chapter, and if all or part of the lots do
not meet the requirements for lot width and area, as established by this
Chapter, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purpose of this Chapter and no portion of said parcel or
lot shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this Chapter, nor shall any division of the
parcel or lot be made which leaves remaining any parcel or lot with
width or area below the requirements stated in this Chapter.
I. Existing Unlawful Uses Not Validated. A use in violation of a provision
of the previous zoning ordinance of the City of Richmond Heights at the
Section
405.380
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.380
AO:625
time this Chapter was adopted, and not then qualifying as a nonconforming
use, shall not be validated as a non-conforming use by the
adoption of this Chapter.
J. Joint Use Of Buildings, Structures And/Or Land. Where a nonconforming
use exists and a conforming use is proposed, the nonconforming
use must cease upon initiation of the conforming use. No
joint use of buildings, structures and/or land shall be permitted.
K. Non-Conformity As Basis For Variance. The existence of a nonconformity
anywhere in the City shall not of itself be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance for other property.
L. Eventual Removal Or Correction Of Non-Conforming Use. Within five
(5) years of the date of the adoption of this Chapter (October 3, 1988),
or the date of adoption of any applicable amendments to this Chapter,
any use which is or becomes a non-conforming use shall be brought into
conformance with the standards established in Section 405.370.

Site Plan Review
Section 405.390. Site Plan Review — Procedure. [Ord. No. 4238
§2(604.2), 10-3-1988; Ord. No. 4274 §13, 6-5-1989; Ord. No. 4313
§5, 3-5-1990; Ord. No. 4346 §1, 7-2-1990; Ord. No. 4381 §1,
2-4-1991; Ord. No. 4504 §1, 7-19-1993]
A. Purpose. It is recognized by this Chapter that there is a value to the
public in establishing safe and convenient traffic movement to higher
density sites, both within the site and in relation to access streets; that
there is value in encouraging a harmonious relationship of buildings
and uses, both within a site and in relation to adjacent uses; further,
that there are benefits to the public in conserving natural resources.
Toward this end, this Chapter requires site plan review and approval by
the Planning and Zoning Commission for certain buildings, structures
and uses that can be expected to have a significant impact on natural
resources, traffic patterns, adjacent land usage, and the character of
future urban development.
The site plan is intended to demonstrate to the Commission the
character and objectives of the proposed development in adequate
detail for the Commission to evaluate the effect the proposed
development would have on the community, and to determine what
provisions, if any, should be included as part of the plan and be binding
on the use and development of the property.
B. Procedures. All such applications shall be set down for hearing before
the Commission not later than the second (2nd) regular monthly
meeting of the Commission from the date of filing the same. Any such
hearing may, for good cause at the request of the applicant or in the
discretion of the Commission, be continued. At least fifteen (15) days'
notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in an
official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation within the City.
1. The City will be responsible for notifying by mail all property
owners within the City limits whose property lies within three
hundred (300) lineal feet of that which has been requested to be
rezoned. Such notice shall be postmarked at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the hearing.
C. Buildings, Structures And Uses Requiring Site Plan Review. The Zoning
Administrator shall not issue a building permit for construction of the
following buildings and structures unless a detailed site plan has been
reviewed and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
such approval is in effect:
1. A multiple-family building containing three (3) or more dwelling
units;
Section
405.390
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.390
AO:627
2. More than one (1) multiple-family building on a lot, parcel or tract
of land, or on a combination of lots under one (1) ownership;
3. A planned development in accordance with the provisions of
Section 405.260;
4. Any building or structure or addition thereto in any commercial or
industrial district with a floor area greater than five hundred (500)
square feet;
5. More than one (1) building or structure (except a sign on a lot,
parcel or tract of land, or combination of lots under one (1)
ownership) in any commercial or industrial district; and
6. Any new parking area or expansion of an existing parking area of
more than five (5) parking spaces of accepted configuration.
D. Application And Fees. Any person who has an ownership or contractual
interest in the subject property may file a request for a site plan review
by the Commission by filing with the Zoning Administrator the
completed application upon the forms provided and payment of the
review fee. As an integral part of said application, the applicant shall
file at least twenty (20) copies of a site plan.
The Zoning Administrator, upon receipt of such site plan, other
necessary data, and payment of the required fee, shall forthwith
transmit the copies to the Commission prior to its next regularly
scheduled meeting, and the Commission shall undertake a study of
same and shall approve or deny the site plan. Written notice will be sent
to the applicant stating the time and place of review of the site plan by
the Commission.
E. Site Plan Data. Every site plan submitted for consideration shall contain
only the pertinent information from this Section to satisfy the scope of
review under Subsection (G) hereof for site plan review and/or for
findings of fact under Section 405.410(E) (if required) for conditional
use permits. The Commission or City Council may request specific
additional information of the petitioner from Subsection (D) hereof, if

other properties in the neighborhood, or
4. A potential for accidents or danger to public health or safety.
B. It is hereby declared that certain land uses and developments present
unique problems with respect to their proper location and relationship
to other land uses. Therefore, analysis and judgment of the
consequences of each development and use is necessary to preserve
and promote the public health, safety and general welfare. Such land
uses and developments are identified in each particular zoning district
under conditional uses.
A. General. The granting of a conditional use permit may be initiated by a
verified application of one or more of the owners of record or owners
under contract of a lot or tract of land, or their authorized
representatives, or by a resolution of intention by the Planning and
Zoning Commission or the City Council. Procedures for application,
review and approvals of a conditional use permit shall be as follows.
B. Application. Application for a conditional use permit for a specific tract

of this Chapter; and
d. Granting the variance will result in substantial justice for all.

a. Relief is necessary because of the unique character of the
property rather than for personal considerations;
b. Applying the strict letter of this Chapter would result in
practical difficulties for the applicant;
c. Imposition of the difficulties is not necessary for the
preservation of this Chapter; and

supports the conclusions required by Subsection (D) hereof, the Board
of Adjustment shall consider all the evidence. "Unnecessary hardship"
means that:
1. The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only
for a purpose allowed in the zone;
2. The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and not to
the general conditions in the neighborhood; and
3. The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the essential
character of the locality.

Adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the
property benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to comply with
the standards set out in Subsection (D) hereof to reduce or minimize
any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in
the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of
this Chapter. Failure to comply with any of these conditions or
restrictions shall constitute a violation of this Chapter punishable as
provided in Section 405.620.

1. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board of
Adjustment shall be necessary to grant any variance.

question is inappropriate or improper;
3. What major economic, physical or social changes, if any, have

(exclusive of streets and alleys) included in such proposed change,
or thirty percent (30%) of the owners within an area determined by
lines drawn parallel to and one hundred eighty-five (185) feet

district classification.
4. Approval of different classification. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend and the City Council may enact by
ordinance a zoning district classification other than that requested
in the petition, provided that the recommendation or ordinance is
for a district classification of the same use type as that requested
by the petitioner. District classification of the same type as referred
to in this Section shall include the "PD" Planned District when a
petitioner proposes a particular use and presents plans at or prior
to the public hearing which are substantially similar to those
required by the "PD" rezoning procedures.
5. Approval of requests involving site plan review. In those instances
where an application for rezoning involves site plan approval, the

Map is denied on final review by the City Council, reapplication for the
purposes of further review of the same application shall not be
accepted by the City until six (6) months following the date of final

new evidence not available during review of the original application will
be presented.

streets and minor streets, school and recreation sites, community
facilities, sanitation, water supply and drainage, and the relationship of
the proposal to other developments, existing or proposed, in the vicinity
should be determined in advance of the preparation of the preliminary
plat.
A. A subdivider desiring approval of a preliminary plat of a subdivision of
any land lying within the City of Richmond Heights shall submit to the
Planning and Zoning Commission a written application for such
approval. Such application shall be accompanied by plans and
information prepared in accordance with the requirements of this
Chapter. Twenty-four (24) copies of the completed form of application
for approval of preliminary subdivision plat, together with twenty-four
(24) prints of each drawing submitted as part of the preliminary plat,
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator no later than twenty-one
(21) days prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at
which consideration is desired. The Zoning Administrator shall review
said preliminary plat to ascertain whether all required information has
been furnished and, if so, the Zoning Administrator shall forthwith
transmit copies of the application to the Planning and Zoning
Commission along with the Zoning Administrator's report on the
application's sufficiency and recommendation for approval or
disapproval.
B. At the time of filing the application for approval of the preliminary plat,
a fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be paid to the City for each lot
appearing on the subdivision plat; provided however, that said amount
shall not be returned to the applicant upon failure to meet the
requirements of this Chapter or to submit a final plat in proper form but
shall be used to defray the administrative costs incidental to processing
the preliminary plat by the Council, the Planning and Zoning
Commission and their officers or employees.

A. Blocks should not normally exceed twelve hundred fifty (1,250) feet in
length unless unusual circumstances justify greater lengths.
B. Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two (2) tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a limited
access highway or railroad right-of-way.
C. No other specific rule is made concerning the shape of blocks, but
blocks must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision, and their
design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow and
public areas.
D. Within blocks of over seven hundred (700) feet in length, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may require, at or near the middle of the block,
a pedestrian way connecting adjacent streets or public areas, shopping
centers, etc. Such pedestrian way shall be at least ten (10) feet in width
of right-of-way and shall be dedicated to public use for pedestrian

as frontage on the right-of-way line.
B. Side lines of lots should be at approximately right angles to straight
streets and on radial lines on curved streets. Some variation from this
rule is permissible, but pointed or very irregular lots shall be avoided.
C. Double frontage lots should not be platted, except that where desired
along major streets, lots may face on an interior street and back on such
thoroughfare. In such an event, a planting strip or planting screen at
least twenty (20) feet in width shall be provided along the rear of the
lot.
D. Corner residential lots shall be wider than normal to permit appropriate
setbacks or front building lines on both streets.
E. Lots of a flag configuration which could place a dwelling unit behind a

status by passage of this Chapter.

Chapter, should any existing sign be enlarged, replaced or
reconstructed, it shall be considered a new sign. If an existing sign is
repainted or the sign panels replaced in connection with or subsequent
to a change in the occupancy of the property on which the sign is
located, it shall be considered a new sign. However, the repainting of a
sign for ordinary maintenance or the repair or restoration of an existing
sign to a safe condition after being damaged by storm or other
accidental act as shown in accordance with the original permit shall not
constitute such a change as to classify the sign as a new sign, subject to
the provisions of Subsection (A)(4) above.

for the erection of the relocated sign shall be granted by the Code
Enforcement Officer.

Officer before the Board of Adjustment as established and in
conformance with the requirements of Section 405.520 et seq., of the
Zoning Regulations, subject to the further requirements of this Section.
B. Grounds For Granting A Variance. The Board of Adjustment may grant
variances from this Chapter for any permitted form of signage where it
is found that strict compliance with this Chapter would subject the
applicant to undue hardship and/or practical difficulties, and to grant
such a variance would:
1. Be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Chapter;

hazard to persons or property because of being in an unsafe condition,
or which obstructs any fire escape, window or door, or any sign erected
in any location where, by reason of its location, it will obstruct the view
of any authorized traffic sign, signal or other traffic control device, or

Chapter 420
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Editor's Note — Ord. no. 4925 §1, adopted March 7, 2005, repealed ch.
420 "flood damage prevention" and enacted new provisions set out herein.
Former ch. 420 derived from CC 1984 §§7-90 — 7-94, 7-100 — 7-102; ord.
no. 3140 §§7-41 — 7-47, 7-49; ord. no. 3397 §1, 5-2-1977; ord. no. 3410 §§1
— 2, 6-6-1977; ord. no. 4169 §1, 4-6-1987; ord. no. 4419 §§1 — 2, 9-3-1991;
ord. no. 4692 §§1 — 3, 12-1-1997.
Section 420.010. Statutory Authorization. [Ord. No. 4925 §1,
3-7-2005; Ord. No. 5276 §1, 12-15-2014]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 89.020, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Richmond Heights,
Missouri, has adopted this Chapter 420 as follows.
Section 420.020. Findings of Fact. [Ord. No. 4925 §1, 3-7-2005;
Ord. No. 5276 §1, 12-15-2014]
A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of the City of Richmond Heights, Missouri, are subject to
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
1. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
2. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods,
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the
depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be

expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1)
year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS,
and illustrative materials for St. Louis County dated February 4,
2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section
420.020(B); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as
defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to
meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of
this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

AO:756
1. No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new
construction, substantial improvements, and other improvements,
including the placement of manufactured homes, within any
numbered or unnumbered A zones and AE zones, unless the
conditions of this Section are satisfied.
2. All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are
subject to inundation of the one-hundred-year flood; however, the
base flood elevation is not provided. Development within
unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this Chapter. If
Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the community shall
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or
floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other
sources.
3. Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be
permitted within any numbered A zone or AE zone on the FIRM,
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point
within the community.
4. All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial
improvements, prefabricated structures, placement of
manufactured homes, and other developments shall require:
a. Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
b. Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;
c. Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood
damages;
d. All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning

such proposals base flood elevation data.
5. Storage, material, and equipment.
a. The storage or processing of materials within the special flood
hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life
is prohibited.
b. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to
prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within
the time available after a flood warning.
6. Accessory structures. Structures used solely for parking and
limited storage purposes, not attached to any other structure on
the site, of limited investment value, and not larger than four
hundred (400) square feet, may be constructed at grade and wetfloodproofed,
provided there is no human habitation or occupancy
of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; a variance
has been granted from the standard floodplain management
requirements of this Chapter; and a floodplain development permit
has been issued.
B. Specific Standards.
1. In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and
AE zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as
set forth in Section 420.070(A)(2), the following provisions are
required:
a. Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structures, including
manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to one (1) foot above base flood elevation.
Section

RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
420.070
AO:758
b. Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1)
foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the
base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator
as set forth in Section 420.060(B)(9).
c. Require, for all new construction and substantial
improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage
in an area other than a basement and that are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
(1) A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
C. Manufactured Homes.
1. All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and
numbered A zones and AE zones on the community's FIRM shall be
required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize
flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are
not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
2. Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within unnumbered or numbered A zones and AE zones,
on the community's FIRM on sites outside of a manufactured home
park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
Section
420.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
420.070
AO:759
park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred
substantial damage as the result of a flood be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base
flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement.
3. Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE
zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the
provisions of Section 420.070(C)(2) of this Chapter, be elevated so
that either:
a. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot
above the base flood level; or
b. The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent
strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height
above grade and be securely attached to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
D. Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
Section 420.050(A) are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following
provisions shall apply:
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based
on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway
must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one
(1) foot at any point.
2. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, and other
development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
3. If Section 420.070(D)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of Section 420.070.

consecutive days;
b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or
c. Meet the permitting, elevation, and the anchoring
requirements for manufactured homes of this Chapter.
*A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
A. Establishment Of Appeal Board. The Board of Adjustment as
established by the City of Richmond Heights shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management
requirements of this Chapter.
B. Responsibility Of Appeal Board.

Section
420.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
420.080
AO:761
1. The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
2. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
6. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood
damage, for the proposed use;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets;
and bridges.
E. Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2)
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing items 2 through 6 below have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of
historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity
will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
Section
420.080
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
420.080
AO:762
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or Chapters.
6. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature
of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct
a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance
coverage and such construction below the base flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by
this Chapter.
F. Conditions For Approving Variances For Accessory Structures. Any
variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided
individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions
as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Section 420.080(D)
and (E) of this Chapter. In order to minimize flood damages during the
one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the
following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for
accessory structures that are constructed at grade and wetfloodproofed.
1. Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and
limited storage purposes in flood-prone areas only.
2. For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e.,
foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring,
etc.) below highest adjacent grade, must be built with floodresistant
materials in accordance with Section 420.070(A)(4)(b) of
this Chapter.
3. The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in
accordance with Section 420.070(A)(4)(a) of this Chapter. All of the
building's structural components must be capable of resisting

Chapter 421
LAND DISTURBANCE CODE
Section 421.010. Scope. [Ord. No. 4965 §1, 1-17-2006]
A. Title. These regulations shall be known as the "Land Disturbance Code"
of Richmond Heights, Missouri, hereinafter referred to as "this code".
B. Introduction. On construction or land disturbance sites, soil is highly
vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water
resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic
habitat for fish and other desirable species. Deposits of eroded soil also
necessitate maintenance of sewers and ditches and the dredging of
lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the
loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
Construction activities also utilize materials and generate wastes,
which if not properly controlled can pollute receiving waters.
C. Purpose. The purpose of this code is to safeguard persons, protect
property and prevent damage to the environment in Richmond Heights.
This code will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating
and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any
development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
results in the movement of earth on land in Richmond Heights.

In General
Section 425.010. Finding and Determination of Necessity. [Ord. No.
4263 §2, 2-6-1989]
It is hereby found, determined and declared by the City Council of the
City of Richmond Heights, Missouri, that in certain residential, commercial
and industrial portions of the City obsolete, deteriorating, substandard,
insanitary or blighted areas exist, occasioned by age, obsolescence,
inadequate planning, outmoded design or physical deterioration, excessive
or unproductive land coverage, lack or appropriate light, air, open space,
defective design or arrangement of building, lack of proper support
facilities or existence of obsolete, inadequate, outmoded and poorly
designed, or physically deteriorated buildings and have become economic
and social liabilities and such conditions are conducive to ill health,
transmission of disease, crime or inability to pay reasonable taxes, have
impaired the economic value of areas infecting them with blight
characterized by depreciated values, impaired investment, reduced income
and consequential inability to pay reasonable taxes; that the assembly
of buildings in blighted areas is essential for the clearance of blight,
replanning, reconstruction and redevelopment for the removal of blight;
that the existence of such conditions and the failure to clear, replan,
rehabilitate, reconstruct or redevelop these areas results in progressive
deterioration, cause a wasteful expenditure of public funds for policing and
occasions large outlays for the creation and maintenance of public facilities
and services; that such conditions require the employment of capital on
an investment basis and the redevelopment of such areas under proper
supervision with appropriate planning as to land use, traffic circulation and
construction; that the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction
and redevelopment of such areas on a substantial scale are necessary
for the removal of blight and for the public welfare; that such obsolete,
deteriorating, substandard, insanitary and blighted areas constitute a
menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the City. It
is necessary to encourage the removal of blight and to provide procedures
for its removal; the removal of blight and the procedures hereby adopted
are determined to be in the public interest.

fixed therein for the performance of the various stages thereof, the
Zoning Administrator, upon the written request of such
corporation, shall conduct an investigation, and if the Zoning
Administrator determines that the redevelopment project or such
stage thereof has been so completed, he/she shall recommend to
the City Council that a certificate of full compliance be issued to
such corporation for such stage or for the entire project, as the
case may be.

redevelopment project or any stage thereof has not been
completed, then the Council shall transmit notice by certified mail,

required by Subsections (1) and (2) of this Section shall not be

A corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of the real property
acquired by it for the purpose of a redevelopment project. The development
plan, the ordinance approving any development plan, and any contract
entered into pursuant thereto may provide that in the event of the sale
or other disposition of real property of a corporation by reason of the
foreclosure of any mortgage or other lien through insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings or by order of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by
voluntary transfer or otherwise, the partial tax relief provided under the

to use, operate and maintain such real property in accordance with the
provisions of the development plan, the Council may grant the partial tax
relief provided in the Urban Redevelopment Corporations Law. If such
real property shall not be used, operated and maintained in accordance
with the provisions of the development plan, or if the purchaser does not
desire the property to continue under the development plan, or if the
ordinance approving the plan provides for termination of tax relief under
such circumstances, the City Council may refuse to grant the purchaser
continuing tax relief, the real property shall be assessed for ad valorem
taxes upon the full true value of the real property and except as provided
by contract may be owned and operated free from any of the conditions,
restrictions or provisions of this Chapter and the development plan.

with, and so dependent upon the void Section that it cannot be presumed
the City Council would have enacted the valid Sections without the void
Section, or unless the court finds that the valid Sections standing alone

permit are impossible or impractical for applicant within the time
necessary and that a temporary occupancy permit is necessary
to prevent undue hardship to the occupant and will not create
health and/or safety risks for applicant. The temporary permit
shall be granted only for such time as the building commissioner
deems reasonably necessary to achieve full compliance, and in any

occupancy has been issued by the building commissioner.
Every owner, agent or manager of any building or addition
thereto shall inform the building commissioner whenever any
portion of said building becomes vacant and request an
inspection thereof under the provisions of this code. The

setting forth the reason(s) the premises cannot meet the
minimum occupancy standards before occupation and the
period of time requested by the applicant for temporary
occupancy permit of such premises. Failure to abate all code
deficiencies and to have the premises re-inspected before
expiration of the temporary occupancy permit will be a
violation of this Section and will be subject to the penalties set
forth in Section 100.150 of the Richmond Heights Municipal
Code.
The temporary occupancy permit shall be granted by the
building commissioner only upon his/her finding that total
compliance with the requirements for an occupancy permit
are impossible or impractical for applicant within the time
necessary and that a temporary occupancy permit is necessary
to prevent undue hardship to the occupant and will not create
health and/or safety risks for applicant. The temporary permit
shall be granted only for time as the building commissioner
deems reasonably necessary to achieve full compliance, and
in any event not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.

application for the temporary occupancy permit is not designed
to evade or avoid the minimum occupancy permit
requirements.

A. Every application for a building permit for a residential or other
building, buildings, fence or other structure which, in the opinion of the
Building Commissioner:
1. Indicates a residential or other building, buildings, fence or other
structure which is unsightly, grotesque and unsuitable, when
compared with surrounding residential or other buildings, fences
or structures;
2. Is detrimental to the stability of value and welfare and happiness of
the community; and
3. Does not conform in general to the surrounding property,
structures and residences,
shall be submitted by the Building Commissioner, along with
plans, elevations, detailed drawings and specifications, to the
Planning and Zoning Commission before being finally approved
by the Building Commissioner.
B. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall keep regular minutes of its

3. Receive and hear any other evidence that may be pertinent for the
purpose of the hearing.
B. The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether the proposed
structure, residence or other building will conform to proper
architectural standards, appearance and design of surrounding
structures, residences and other buildings, and that the same will not in
any way be unsightly, grotesque and unsuitable as detrimental to the
stability of values and welfare of surrounding property, structures and
residences and to the general welfare and happiness of the community.
C. Examples of criteria for review may be:
1. Detail. Detail and form should be used to provide visual interest.
Evaluation of the appearance of a project shall be based on the
quality of its design and relationship to surroundings. Additions
should relate to the existing buildings in design, details, colors and
material.
2. Scale and proportion. The height, scale and proportion of each
building should be compatible with its site and adjoining buildings.
Building components such as windows and doors should have
proportions appropriate to the architecture of the structure.
3. Proportion. Elements of building massing should relate to the size
and shape of those adjacent buildings.
4. Materials. Materials should be selected for suitability to the type of
building and the design in which they are used and for harmony
with adjoining buildings. Materials should be of durable quality.
5. Colors. Colors, including trim and accent colors, should be
harmonious and visually compatible with neighboring buildings.
6. Awnings, canopies and marquees. Awnings, canopies and
marquees should fit the character of the building and not interfere
with the appearance of the surrounding buildings.
7. Preservation of period detail. Original details on existing buildings
such as cornices, horizontal bands and decorative elements should
be preserved where practicable.
8. Screening. Facilities, including, but not limited to, trash dumpsters
and rooftop and mechanical units, should be visually screened with
materials harmonious with the building.
9. Lighting. Exterior lighting, when used, should be of a design and
size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Excessive
brightness should be avoided.
10. Landscaping. Landscape treatment, where appropriate, should be
provided to enhance architectural features and provide visual

[Ord. No. 4930 §1, 4-4-2005]
interest. Landscape materials may include plants, trees, fences,
walls and pavings.
A. In addition to the general review criteria of Section 505.030(C), the
following guidelines shall be observed for in-fill housing. "In-fill
housing" is development on a vacant or substantially vacant tract of
land surrounded by existing development. The intent of these
guidelines is to ensure that in-fill redevelopment responds to the
established character and variation within the various neighborhoods
by utilizing complementary design characteristics, setbacks, massing
and building heights.
1. Site.
a. Surface water. No alteration in the flow of the existing surface
water may occur which will result in increased water flow onto
any adjoining residential property, nor may the natural surface
water flow be altered in a way which will obstruct the flow and
cause the water to back up on adjoining property. The intent is
for the surface water to drain to either approved storm inlets,
natural drainage ways or be conveyed by swales or pipes onto
the street.
b. Roof drains, sump pumps or other piped water system shall not
be discharged onto adjacent property but shall be drained as
noted in Subsection (A) above.
c. No more than sixty percent (60%) of the required front yard
setback shall be covered by impervious material.
d. No more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the required rear
yard may be covered by impervious materials.
2. Trees — recommendation. At least one (1) tree should be planted
for each fifty (50) foot of street frontage. The tree should be planted
in the front yard with a minimum of two hundred (200) square feet
of planting area surrounding the tree. The tree shall be from the list
of preferred large canopy trees listed in the Richmond Heights City
Design Guidelines. If the tree cannot be planted with at least
twenty (20) feet of horizontal clearance to overhead utility lines, an
approved understory tree may be substituted.
3. Building design.
a. Height. No building shall exceed the height restrictions
described for the zoning district in which the lot is located.
b. Any structure, which exceeds the height of the principal
structure on an abutting side property by more than twelve
Section
505.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
505.035
AO:843
(12) feet, shall provide a fifty percent (50%) increase to the
required side yard setback or the house shall "step-down"
to meet the height of the adjacent structure. Information
detailing the height of the adjacent structures shall be
submitted with the application for a building permit.
c. Excessive similarity to other structures within two hundred
(200) feet of the subject property shall be avoided. No single
architectural style should be imposed upon the buildings and
each should reflect its own individual style. Excessive
dissimilarity in relation to other residential structures within
two hundred (200) feet of the subject property shall be
avoided.
In evaluating the proposed building's ability to conform in
general to surrounding structures and residences,
comparisons of the following design features shall be
considered:
(1) Landscaping.
(2) Combination of materials.
(3) Texture of materials.
(4) Site development.
(5) Location of garages and carports.
(6) Use of brick and stone. Note: If the predominate exterior
finish material on the houses within two hundred (200)
feet is of brick, conformance with this Section shall require
a substantial use of brick.
(7) Height of building.
(8) Type and shape of roof.
(9) Size, quality and placement of doors and windows.
(10) Use of architectural design features to create visual
interest.
(11) Use of porches.
d. Garages.
(1) For lots over fifty (50) feet in width, as measured along the
front lot line, no attached front entry garages shall be
permitted. The garages shall be side or rear entry or
detached from the principle structure. [Ord. No. 5370,

For corner lots fronting on two (2) streets, a front entry
garage on a lot over fifty (50) feet in width shall not
be allowed on the street front for which the majority of
the neighboring homes are oriented. A front entry garage
that does not protrude past the primary plane of the
house may be erected to the side of the house which is
not oriented to the neighboring homes' front entrance.
Orientation for the purpose of this Section shall mean the
plane where a majority of neighboring homes have their
front entrance.
(2) For lots fifty (50) feet in width or less as measured along
the front lot line, front entry garages shall only be
permitted for below grade access. A "below grade" access
garage shall normally access the house at the basement
level and shall not access the home at the level of the main
pedestrian street front entrance. The below grade vehicle
door shall be of material and designed to complement the
structure and shall include raised design features and
windows to break up the monotony of the door. The garage
door shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in width or fifty
percent (50%) of the building width.
(3) Below grade front entry garages shall not protrude past
the primary plane of the front façade of the structure.
EXCEPTION: Grade front entry garages are permitted for
lots of fifty (50) feet in width or less provided they do
not protrude more than eight (8) feet past the primary
plane of the front façade of the dwelling and the dwelling
shall have a covered front porch that extends the depth
of the garage protrusion and runs the full length or front
of the house. The vehicle door for the protruding garage
shall not exceed eight (8) feet in width or thirty percent
(30%) of the building width, whichever is smaller. The
vehicle door shall be of material and design to complement
the structure and shall include raised design features and
windows to break up the monotony of the door.
(4) Any lot which is located on an improved alley way shall
access the required off-street parking from the alley.
A. At the meeting and after the hearing, or at any meeting within fifteen
(15) days subsequent thereto, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall, by majority vote, approve the application if, in its opinion, the
proposed structure will conform to proper architectural standards of

Building Commissioner without disapproval under Section 505.040, or
if the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to act within sixty (60) days
after the Building Commissioner has delivered the plans to the Planning

power of the City including, but not limited to, all powers regarding
zoning, supervision of construction, assurance of equal
employment opportunities, control of rights-of-way and consumer
protection.
2. Registration hereunder shall not deprive any person of any rights
or obligations imposed by any previously existing franchise, license
or contract, nor shall it impose any obligations on any such person
additional to those included in any previously existing franchise,
license or contract, except to the extent allowed by law.
3. Nothing in this code shall be construed to prohibit the grant or
renewal of any franchise by the City as may be allowed or required
by State or Federal law.
4. Nothing in this Code shall be construed or deemed to supersede
any applicable State or Federal law or any applicable regulation
issued by a State or Federal agency including, but not limited to,
the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Federal
Communications Commission. In the event of any conflict between
such laws or regulations and this Code, the applicable State or
Federal law or regulation shall apply.

way and restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to
the City and charge the person the costs therefor, including by
placing a lien on the person's property as provided in connection
with abating nuisances; or
4. Take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law.
Additionally, such person may also be subject to the imposition of
penalties as provided herein.

AO:896
Section 520.530. Registration Procedures. [Ord. No. 4811 §1,
2-4-2002]
1. Because of unique facilities, wireless transmission providers shall
be exempt from registration but shall be required to enter into a
license or franchise agreement with the City for facilities to be
located within the rights-of-way. Such license or franchise
agreement may deviate from the requirements of this code to
accommodate or address the unique facilities of wireless
transmission providers, but nothing herein shall be construed to
require either the placement of such facilities in the ROW or a
license or franchise agreement for such placement. The license or
franchise agreement also may require payment of a reasonable and
appropriate rental fee as may be allowed by law. Exemption from
registration does not authorize a wireless transmission provider to
perform any ROW work unless the wireless transmission provider
either obtains a ROW permit as provided herein or performs such
work as may be specified in a license or franchise agreement. The
facilities of wireless transmission providers may also be subject to
such other lawful regulation as the City deems appropriate.
2. Governmental entities having facilities within the ROW need not
register hereunder, but such entities shall be subject to Sections
520.540 and 520.550 of this Code and such other Sections or
provisions as may be appropriate to their presence in the ROW.
A. Requirements And Processing.
1. Registration shall be accomplished in the form of a letter to the City
filed with the City Clerk.
2. To be valid, the registration letter must be signed by an authorized
representative of the registering person, contain all required
information and be accompanied by a filing fee established in the
City's pertinent schedule of fees.
3. At any time the City determines a registration letter does not
comply with this code, the City may return it to a point of contact
identified therein with a written explanation of the reason(s) for
such return. Filing fees shall not be refunded. Failure to return a
registration letter shall not validate an incomplete or otherwise
invalid or void registration letter.
B. Contents Of Registration Letter. A registration letter shall contain or be
accompanied by the information required herein. All such information
received by the City shall remain confidential insofar as permitted by
the Missouri Open Meetings Law and other applicable State and
Federal law. The information required shall include:
1. Name, address and legal status of the registering person;
Section
520.520
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.530
AO:897
2. Name, title, address, telephone number, e-mail address and fax
number of individual(s) authorized to serve as the point of contact
between the City and the registering person so as to make contact
possible at any time (i.e., twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7)
days per week);
3. Description of the general uses made or to be made of the facilities
located within the rights-of-way by the registering person, e.g.,
provision of service(s), transfer or lease of facilities (or portion
thereof, including bandwidth) to another person, use of the
facilities to transverse the City, construction of facilities to be used
at a later date, etc.;
4. Description of all services provided or to be provided by the
registering person to any person located in the City through
facilities located within the rights-of-way and an explanation of the
registering person's legal qualifications to provide such services,
including copies of supporting documentation such as relevant
certificates or orders from the Federal Communications
Commission, Missouri Secretary of State and/or Missouri Public
Service Commission or pertinent rules or Statutes;
5. Name and address of any and all other persons providing service(s)
to any person located in the City through the registering person's
facilities located within the rights-of-way and a general description
of such service(s); and
6. Current certificates of insurance in accordance with this Code.
C. Notice Of Change. Within thirty (30) days of any changes in the
information set forth in or accompanying its registration letter, a
registered person shall notify the City of any such change. Such notices
shall be submitted and processed in the same manner as an initial
registration, except the filing fee established in Section 520.530(A)(2)
shall not be required.
D. Registration Index. The City Clerk shall maintain an index of all
registered persons and their point(s) of contact.
E. Termination Of Registration.
1. The City shall have the right to terminate a registration for a
substantial and ongoing failure to comply with this code or other
applicable law or for defrauding or attempting to defraud the City.
To invoke the provisions of this Section, the City Manager shall give
the person written notice of such intent. If within thirty (30)
calendar days following such written notice from the City the
person has not completed corrective action or corrective action is
not being actively and expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of
the City Manager, the City Manager may commence a proceeding
to consider terminating the person's registration giving written
notice of the reasons therefor.
Section
520.530
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section

AO:898
Section 520.540. Rights-of-Way ("ROW") Permits. [Ord. No. 4811
§1, 2-4-2002]
2. Prior to terminating a registration, the City Manager shall hold a
hearing, after giving at least ten (10) calendar days' notice to the
person, at which time the person shall be given an opportunity to
be heard. Following the hearing, the City Manager may determine
whether to terminate the registration based on the information
presented at the hearing and other information of record. If the
City Manager determines to terminate a registration, the decision
shall be in writing setting forth the reasons therefor. The City
Manager may make such decision conditional on a person's failure
to resolve outstanding problems or take appropriate steps to
resolve such problems within a specific period of time. A copy of
such decision shall be provided to the person.
3. Once a registration has been terminated by the City Manager, the
person may not register again except upon express written
approval by the City Manager, which approval shall be withheld
absent clear and convincing evidence that the person has remedied
all previous violations and is in full compliance with all laws and
will not in the future violate this code or defraud the City.
A. ROW Permit Requirements.
1. Any person desiring to perform ROW work must first apply for and
obtain a ROW permit in addition to any other building permit,
license, easement, franchise or authorization required by law. In
the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the person
conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify the City of
the location of the work and shall apply for the required ROW
permit as soon as practicable following the commencement of the
work, not to exceed the third (3rd) business day thereafter. The
Director may design and issue general permits for emergency ROW
work for several different locations or throughout the City.
2. No person having facilities within the ROW who has failed to
register with the City shall be granted a ROW permit, except as
otherwise provided or allowed by ordinance, franchise, license or
written contract with the City.
3. All applications for ROW permits shall be submitted to the Director.
The Director may design and make available standard forms for
such applications, requiring such information as allowed by law
and as the Director determines in his or her discretion to be
necessary and consistent with the provisions of this code and to
accomplish the purposes of this code. Each application shall at
minimum contain the following information for the proposed ROW
work, unless otherwise waived by the Director:
Section
520.530
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.540
AO:899

the work;
b. If different from the applicant, the name of the person on
whose behalf the proposed work is to be performed;
c. A description of the proposed work, including a conceptual
master plan and, when applicable, an engineering site plan or
other technical drawing showing the nature, dimensions and
location of the applicant's proposed work or facilities, their
proximity to other facilities that may be affected by the
proposed work, and the number of street crossings and their
locations and dimensions;
d. Projected commencement and termination dates and
anticipated duration of the work or, if such dates are unknown,
a representation that the applicant shall provide the Director
with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are
determined;
e. If the applicant is, or is acting on behalf of, a person having
facilities within the ROW or a person desiring to become a
person having facilities within the ROW, verification that the
applicant or such person has registered with the City and that
the information included in that registration is accurate as of
the date of the application; and
f. Copies of any required certificates of insurance or
performance/maintenance bonds.
g. For wireless transmission providers:
(1) Technical information, including:
(a) A detailed description of the physical dimensions and
appearance of the proposed facilities;
(b) The chemical composition of any battery contained
within the proposed facilities;
(c) Any hazardous material contained within the proposed
facilities;
(d) The potential for interference with the facilities of
other wireless transmission providers;
(e) The potential for exposure to electromagnetic fields;
and
Section
520.540
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.540
AO:900
(f) Such other information as may be reasonably required
by the Director and consistent with Subsection
520.540(B)(4) hereof; and
(2) Certification, by a duly authorized representative of any
person owning a facility, utility pole or other structure
within the ROW upon which the applicant's facility is to be
attached or secured, that
(a) The applicant has permission from such person to
install the facility,
(b) The person is not in default of any franchise, license or
other agreement with the City, and
(c) The person is not in substantial violation of any
provision of this code.
4. The information required by the application may be submitted in
the form maintained by the applicant, provided it is responsive to
the application's requirements, and the applicant shall be allowed a
reasonable amount of time to complete the application based on
the amount of data or information requested or required.
5. Each such application shall be accompanied by the following
payments:
a. An application fee, as approved by the City Council and
established in the City's pertinent schedule of fees, to cover the
cost of processing the application;
b. Any applicable degradation fee, established in the City Council
and established in the City's pertinent schedule of fees, but the
Director may waive the degradation fee for any excavation in
the rights-of-way undertaken within twelve (12) calendar
months immediately preceding the scheduled improvement or
reconstruction of such rights-of-way; and
c. Any other amounts otherwise due to the City from the
applicant including, but not limited to, prior delinquent permit
fees and costs, delinquent rental fees and any loss, damage or
expense suffered by the City because of the applicant's prior
excavations of the rights-of-way or for any emergency actions
taken by the City, but the Director may modify this requirement
to the extent the Director determines any such fees to be in
good-faith dispute or beyond the ability of the applicant to
control.
B. ROW Permit Application Review And Determination. [Ord. No. 5260
§2, 9-2-2014]
1. The Director shall promptly review each completed application for
a ROW permit and shall grant or deny all such applications as
Section
520.540
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.540
AO:901
provided herein within thirty-one (31) days of receipt thereof. Upon
a failure to act on an application for a ROW permit within thirtyone
(31) days, it shall be deemed approved. Unless the application
is denied, the Director shall issue a ROW permit upon determining
that the applicant has submitted all necessary information, has
paid the appropriate fees and is in full compliance with this Article
and all other City ordinances. The Director may establish
procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic
payment of fees to avoid excessive processing and accounting
costs.
2. It is the intention of the City that interference with, damage to,
excavation or disruption of, or the placement of facilities within, the
City's rights-of-way should be minimized and limited in scope to the
extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of this Article. When
reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the
Director may recommend as alternatives to the proposed ROW
work either less disruptive methods or different locations for
facilities, provided that any required alternative shall not increase
expenses by more than ten percent (10%) of the applicant's costs
for the work as proposed, shall not result in a decline of service
quality, and shall be competitively neutral and non-discriminatory.
The Director shall justify to the applicant that the required
alternative is reasonable and necessary.
3. Upon receipt of an application for a ROW permit, the Director shall
determine whether any portion of the rights-of-way will be affected
by the proposed ROW work and whether the interference or
disruption will be more than minor in nature. In determining
whether the proposed ROW work is more than minor in nature, the
Director shall consider the nature and scope of the work, its
location and duration, and its effect on the rights-of-way and the
use thereof.
a. If the applicant can show to the Director's reasonable
satisfaction that the work involves no or only minor
interference, disruption or damage to the rights-of-way or that
the work involves time-sensitive maintenance, then the
Director shall promptly grant the ROW permit.
b. If the Director determines that the effect on the rights-of-way
will be more than minor in nature and no exemption under the
above Subsection (a) or any other provision of this code
applies, the Director shall schedule and coordinate the work
and grant the ROW permit accordingly. When reasonable and
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this code, the Director
may postpone issuance of a ROW permit and may give public
notice of the application in an attempt to identify whether
other person(s) intend to do work in the same area within a
reasonable period of time so that all ROW work in the area can
be coordinated. Due regard shall be accorded applicants that
Section
520.540
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.540
AO:902
are required by any law, rule, regulation, license or franchise
to provide service to the area defined in the application. The
Director shall not impose any coordination or scheduling
requirements that prevent or unreasonably delay an
applicant's access to the ROW or that create a barrier to entry.
c. Applicants shall participate in any joint planning, construction
and advance notification of such work, including coordination
and consolidation of any excavation of or disturbance to the
rights-of-way, as directed by the Director. When deemed
necessary to accomplish the goals of this Section and to the
extent permitted by law, the City reserves the right, when
feasible and reasonable, to require the sharing of facilities by
ROW users. Applicants shall cooperate with each other and
other ROW users and the City for the best, most efficient, most
aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the rights-of-way.
d. The Director shall establish procedures allowing applicants to
ascertain whether existing capacity may be available from
other persons utilizing the rights-of-way along the intended
path of any proposed work. The Director shall also maintain
indexes of all ROW permits issued, both by the ROW user and
by the affected rights-of-way.
4. In addition to the foregoing and in addition to any other standards
or requirements imposed by this code with regard to an application
filed by a wireless transmission provider, the Director shall ensure
compliance with the following provisions:
a. The design, location and nature of all facilities shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Director as provided herein.
Such review shall be non-discriminatory and competitively
neutral, and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld.
b. Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright,
reflective or metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be considered
neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the
proposed equipment. Facilities shall be located in such a
manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. Screening may
be appropriate and any screening materials shall be
maintained and replaced as needed.
c. Facilities shall comply with the regulations established in the
City's Zoning Ordinance to the extent such regulations
reasonably apply. If the facilities consist of or require a tower,
otherwise defined as an antenna support structure, then the
application shall obtain a special antenna permit as provided in
said ordinance.
Section
520.540
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.540
AO:903
d. The Director may designate certain locations or facilities in the
ROW to be excluded from use by the applicant for its facilities
including, but not limited to:
(1) Ornamental or similar specially-designed street lights,
(2) Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that do not
have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the
proposed facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or
wind loading thereof,
(3) Facilities, equipment, structure or location that in the
reasonable judgment of the Director is/or are incompatible
with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe
or unstable by the installation, and
(4) Facilities, equipment, structure or location that have been
designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise
available for use by the applicant due to engineering,
technological, proprietary, legal or other limitations or
restrictions.
e. If the application of this Section 520.540(B)(4) excludes
locations for facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts
with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the
Director shall cooperate in good faith with the application to
attempt to find suitable alternatives, but such alternatives may
exceed the cost increase limitation established by Section
520.540(B)(2) and the City shall not be required to incur any
financial cost or to acquire new locations for the application.
f. The grant of a ROW permit shall not eliminate the need of a
wireless transmission provider to have obtained a license,
permit or other agreement for attaching facilities to other
facilities, poles or other structures, whether owned by the City
or other person.
g. Nothing in this code shall be construed to require that the City
grant wireless transmission providers access to any City
facilities or the City's proprietary property, but the City may
enter into separate agreements with wireless transmission
providers to allow such access. Such agreements may include
the payment of reasonable attachment fees for use of City
facilities or other City property. All such agreements shall be
non-discriminatory and competitively neutral among wireless
transmission providers.
5. Each ROW permit shall include:
a. Projected commencement and termination dates or, if such
dates are unknown at the time the ROW permit is issued, a
provision requiring the ROW user to provide the Director with
Section
520.540
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.540
AO:904
reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are
determined;
b. Length of affected rights-of-way, number of road crossings and
identification and description of any pavement or curb cuts
included in the work;
c. Information regarding scheduling and coordination of work, if
necessary;
d. The location of any of the applicant's facilities, both those
proposed and existing, and the location of any known facilities
owned by another person that may be affected by the proposed
work;
e. An acknowledgement and representation by the applicant to
comply with the terms and conditions of the ROW permit and
this code; and
f. Such conditions and requirements as are deemed reasonably
necessary by the Director:
(1) To protect structures and other facilities in the rights-ofway
from damage,
(2) For the proper restoration of such rights-of-way, structures
and facilities,
(3) For the protection of the public and the continuity of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and
(4) For the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
6. An applicant receiving a ROW permit shall promptly notify the
Director of any material changes in the information submitted in
the application. The Director may issue a revised ROW permit or
require that the ROW user reapply for a ROW permit in accordance
with all requirements of this code.
7. ROW permits inure to the benefit of the applicant, and the rights
granted thereunder may not be assigned or transferred to any
other person without the written consent of the Director.
8. The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in
the public interest, for the following reasons:
a. Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;
b. Failure to provide information required by the application or
this code;
c. The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this code or
other pertinent and applicable City ordinances;
Section
520.540
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.540
AO:905
d. Failure to return the ROW to its previous condition under
previously issued ROW permits or after prior excavations by
the applicant;
e. For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity, as
defined by applicable Federal, State or local law, of land within
the scope of the application;
f. For an applicant's refusal to comply with alternative ROW work
methods or locations required by the Director pursuant to this
code; and
g. For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, provided that:
(1) Such denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of
the Missouri Public Service Commission,
(2) Such denial does not interfere with a ROW user's right of
eminent domain of private property, and
(3) Such denial shall is imposed on a competitively neutral
and non-discriminatory basis.
9. For the purposes of Subsection 520.540(B)(8), the term "applicant"
shall also include, when applicable, the person on whose behalf the
applicant is to perform the ROW work. The Director may consider
good-faith disputes with, or circumstances beyond the control of,
the applicant or such person in determining whether to grant or
deny the application.
C. ROW Permit Revocation And Code Violation Prosecution.
1. The Director may revoke a ROW permit without fee refund after
notice and an opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the ROW permit.
Prior to revocation the Director shall provide written notice to the
ROW user identifying any substantial breach and allowing a
reasonable period of time not longer than thirty (30) days to cure
the problem, which cure period may be immediate if certain
activities must be stopped to protect the public safety. The cure
period shall be extended by the Director on good cause shown by
the ROW user. A substantial breach includes, but is not limited to,
the following:
a. A material violation of a provision of the ROW permit;
b. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
ROW permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any
fraud or deceit upon the City or its residents;
c. A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW permit
application;
Section

RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.540
AO:906
Section 520.550. Work in The Rights-of-Way. [Ord. No. 4811 §1,
2-4-2002]
d. A failure to complete ROW work by the date specified in the
ROW permit, unless an extension is obtained or unless the
failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the ROW
user's control; and
e. A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to
cure as specified by the Director, work that does not conform to
applicable national safety codes, industry construction
standards or the City's pertinent and applicable ordinances
including, but not limited to this code, provided that City
standards are no more stringent than those of a national safety
code.
2. Any breach of the terms and conditions of a ROW permit shall also
be deemed a violation of this code, and in lieu of revocation the
Director may initiate prosecution of the ROW user for such
violation as provided in Section 520.580(H) hereof.
A. Jurisdiction, Inspection And Stop Work Orders.
1. All facilities and ROW work shall be subject to inspection by the
City and the supervision of all Federal, State and local authorities
having jurisdiction in such matters to ensure compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations.
2. The Director shall have full access to all portions of the ROW work
and may issue stop work orders and corrective orders to prevent
unauthorized work, including work not meeting the standards
established in Subsection (F) hereof. Such orders:
a. May be delivered personally or by certified mail to the address
listed on the application for the ROW permit, the person in
charge of the construction site at the time of delivery or the
registered person's point of contact;
b. Shall state that work not authorized by the ROW permit is
being carried out, summarize the unauthorized work and
provide a period of not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the
problem, which cure period may be immediate if certain
activities must be stopped to protect the public safety; and
c. May be enforced by equitable action in the Circuit Court of St.
Louis County, Missouri, and in such case the person involved in
the work shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by
the City in enforcing such orders, including reasonable
attorney's fees in addition to any and all penalties established
in this code.
B. Installation Of Facilities.
Section
520.540
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.550
AO:907
1. In conjunction with the City's long-standing policy favoring
underground construction, no person may erect, construct or
install new poles or other facilities above the surface of the rightsof-
way without the written permission of the City. Such permission
may be granted through a ROW permit when other similar facilities
exist above ground or when physical conditions are such that
underground construction is impossible, impractical or
economically unfeasible, as determined by the City, and when in the
City's judgment the above ground construction has minimal
aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed.
2. During installation of facilities and to the extent authorized by law,
existing underground conduits shall be used whenever feasible and
permitted by the owner thereof.
3. In the case of new construction or property development, the
developer or property owner shall give to all persons registered
hereunder reasonable written advance notice of the particular date
on which open trenching will be available for installation of
facilities. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring
facilities within the development shall be borne by the developer or
property owner; except that if the facilities are not installed within
five (5) working days of the date the trenches are available, as
designated in the notice given by the developer or property owner,
then once the trenches are thereafter closed, the cost of new
trenching shall be borne by the person installing the facilities.
C. Relocation Of Equipment And Facilities.
1. In the event of an emergency, or where construction equipment or
facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger to
health, safety or property, the City may, to the extent allowed by
law, remove, relay or relocate such construction equipment, or the
pertinent parts of such facilities, without charge to the City for
such action or for restoration or repair. The City shall attempt to
notify the owner of the construction equipment or facilities prior to
taking such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent same.
Thereafter, the City shall notify the owner of the construction
equipment or facilities as soon as practicable.
2. Should the grades or boundaries of the rights-of-way be changed at
any time, a ROW user shall, if necessary, at its own cost and
expense, relocate or change its facilities so as to conform with the
new grades or boundaries. This requirement shall not apply when
the ROW user holds a valid easement that existed prior to the date
when the area in question became rights-of-way. The ROW user
shall bear the burden of establishing to the City's satisfaction the
fact of the pre-existing easement.
Section
520.550
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.550
AO:908
3. At the City's direction, all facilities shall be moved underground
and the cost shall be solely the obligation of the owners (or as
otherwise allowed or required by law).
4. Any ROW user shall, on the request of the City or any person
authorized by the City, temporarily relocate facilities to permit the
moving of buildings or oversized vehicles.
5. Any ROW user shall, within a reasonable time specified by the City,
protect, support, disconnect, relocate or remove, at its own
expense, construction equipment or discrete portions of its
facilities when required by the City by reason of traffic conditions;
public safety; rights-of-way construction, maintenance or repair
(including resurfacing or widening); change of rights-of-way grade;
construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any type of government-owned
communications system, public work or improvement or any
government-owned utility; rights-of-way vacation; or for any other
purpose where the convenience of the City would be reasonably
served thereby.
6. If any action under Subsections (4) or (5) is reasonably required of
a ROW user to accommodate a person or another ROW user, the
ROW user shall, after reasonable advance written notice, take
action to effect the necessary actions requested, and the actual
cost, reasonably incurred, of such actions shall be paid by the
person or ROW user upon whose behalf the action is requested.
The ROW user taking such action shall have the authority to
require such payment in advance.
7. Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW
user may abandon the facilities if approved by the City as provided
in Subsection (E) hereof.
8. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property, and no
person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location
of any facilities within the rights-of-way shall be a vested interest.
D. Property Repair And Alterations.
1. During any ROW work, the person doing the work shall protect
from damage any and all existing structures and property
belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all rights-ofway,
public property or private property disturbed or damaged
during the work shall be repaired or replaced by the person doing
the work or the person on whose behalf the work is being done, and
such person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of the
damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed
within a reasonable time specified by the Director and to the
Director's satisfaction.
Section
520.550
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.550
AO:909
2. Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage
system or to any City, State or other public structures or facilities in
the rights-of-way required on account of the construction,
installation, repair or maintenance of facilities within the rights-ofway
shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such
facilities.
E. Removal, Abandonment And Transfer Of Facilities.
1. If a registration is terminated, the City may require that the person
having facilities within the ROW remove its facilities from the
rights-of-way at the person's expense. In removing its facilities the
person shall obtain a ROW permit and restore any excavation that
shall be made by it as required by this code. The liability, indemnity,
insurance and bonding requirements as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during and after the period of
removal and restoration and until full compliance by the person
with the terms and conditions of this Subsection and the
requirements of this code.
2. If the person having facilities within the ROW fails to remove the
facilities and restore the ROW within a reasonable period of time,
the City may, to the extent permitted by law, have the removal done
at the person's expense.
a. Alternatively, the City may permit the abandonment, without
removal, of any facilities if the Director determines that
abandonment will not result in interference with the use or
maintenance of the rights-of-way or if ownership of the
facilities is transferred as provided herein.
b. The City may decide that the ownership of the facilities shall
revert to the City or to such person as directed by the City. In
either case the owner of the facilities, if required by the City
and permitted by law, shall submit a written instrument,
satisfactory in form to City, transferring to the City, or to such
person as directed by the City, ownership of the facilities. The
City may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the facilities
reverting to the City.
3. If a person having facilities within the ROW
a. Discontinues use of any facility for a continuous period of
twelve (12) months,
b. Has installed the facilities without complying with the
requirements of this code, or
c. Declares the facilities abandoned, or if such facilities are
(1) No longer in active use,
Section
520.550
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.550
AO:910
(2) No longer capable of being used for the same or similar
purpose for which the facilities were installed, or
(3) Are physically disconnected from any other facility that is
in use or in service, the facilities may be deemed
abandoned. If such abandonment occurs, the City may
require the removal of the facilities, remove the facilities
at the expense of the person having facilities within the
ROW, allow the abandonment of the facilities without
removal or require the transfer of the facilities, all as
provided in this Subsection (E).
4. The City shall not remove any facilities unless the existence of such
facilities prevents or significantly impairs the use, repair,
excavation or construction of the ROW. The City shall not remove or
seek to possess or transfer the facilities until thirty (30) days have
passed following written notice to the person having facilities
within the ROW of the City's intent to so act. The City may choose
not to act on good cause shown by the person having facilities
within the ROW.
F. Standards For ROW Work.
1. Except for emergency ROW work as provided in Section
520.540(A)(1), ROW work shall be performed only upon issuance
and in accordance with the requirements of a ROW permit. At all
times during the work, ROW permits shall be conspicuously
displayed at the work site and shall be available for inspection by
the Director.
2. If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the ROW work
shall differ from that allowed by the ROW permit, the ROW user
shall inform the Director. The Director may issue a waiver, an
extension or a revised ROW permit, or require that the ROW user
reapply for a ROW permit in accordance with all requirements of
this code.
3. ROW users shall not open or encumber more of the rights-of-way
than is reasonably necessary to complete the ROW work in the
most expeditious manner or allow excavations to remain open
longer than is necessary to complete the work.
4. All ROW work that affects vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be
properly signed, barricaded and otherwise protected at the ROW
user's expense. The ROW user shall be responsible for providing
adequate traffic control to the area surrounding the work as
determined by the Director.
5. The ROW user shall perform the ROW work at such times that will
allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the
peace and quiet of the neighborhood, as permitted by the Director.
Unless otherwise provided by the Director in the permit, non-
Section
520.550
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.550
AO:911
emergency ROW work on arterial and collector streets may not be
accomplished during the hours of 7:00 A.M. to 8:30 A.M. and 4:00
P.M. to 6:00 P.M. in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow.
6. The ROW user shall notify the City no less than three (3) working
days in advance of any ROW work that would require any street
closure or would reduce traffic flow to less than two (2) lanes of
moving traffic for more than four (4) hours. Except in the event of
emergency ROW work, no such closure shall take place without
notice and prior authorization from the City.
7. All ROW work shall be in accordance with all applicable Sections of
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National
Electrical Safety Code, and other Federal, State or local laws and
regulations that may apply including, without limitation, local
health, safety, construction and zoning codes and laws and
accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or
adopted. In the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the
most stringent code or standard shall apply (except insofar as that
code or standard, if followed, would result in facilities that could
not meet requirements of Federal, State or local law).
8. All facilities shall be installed and located to cause minimum
interference with the rights and convenience of property owners,
other ROW users and the City. Facilities shall not be placed where
they will disrupt or interfere with other utility facilities or public
improvements or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various
utilities serving the residents and businesses in the City or public
improvements.
9. All facilities shall be of good and durable quality.
10. All ROW work shall be conducted in accordance with good
engineering practices, performed by experienced and properly
trained personnel so as not to endanger any person or property or
to unreasonably interfere in any manner with the rights-of-ways or
legal rights of any property owner, including the City, or
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
11. All safety practices required by law shall be used during ROW
work, including commonly accepted methods and devices to
prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injury or nuisance to the public.
12. Any contractor or subcontractor of a ROW user must be properly
licensed under laws of the State and all applicable local ordinances,
and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same
obligations with respect to its work as a ROW user would have
pursuant to this code. A ROW user:
a. Must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all
employees performing ROW work are trained and experienced,
Section
520.550
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.550
AO:912
b. Shall be responsible for ensuring that all work is performed
consistent with the ROW permit and applicable law,
c. Shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of
contractors or subcontractors,
d. Shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions
by any contractor or subcontractor, and
e. Shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the
work is properly performed.
G. Restoring And Maintaining The Rights-Of-Way.
1. To complete any ROW work the ROW user shall restore the ROW
and surrounding areas, including, but not limited to, any pavement,
foundation, concrete slabs or curbs, in accordance with the
standards of Subsection (F) hereof and the reasonable conditions of
the Director. Restoration of the ROW shall be completed within the
dates specified in the ROW permit unless the Director issues a
waiver, extension or a new or revised ROW permit.
2. If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the date specified
either by the ROW permit or any extension thereof as granted by
the Director, the City may perform its own restoration. The City
may also opt to perform its own restoration regardless of any
failure by the ROW user, in which case the ROW permit, or any
amendment or revision thereto, shall note such option. In either
event, if the City performs the restoration, the ROW user shall be
responsible for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual
restoration costs within thirty (30) days of invoice.
3. Every ROW user to whom a ROW permit has been granted shall
guarantee for a period of four (4) years the restoration of the ROW
in the area where the ROW user conducted excavation and
performed the restoration. During this period the ROW user shall,
upon notification from the Director, correct all restoration work to
the extent necessary as required by the Director. Said work shall be
completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30)
calendar days from receipt of the Director's notice unless otherwise
permitted by the Director. If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW
within the time specified, the City may perform the work and the
ROW user shall be responsible for reimbursing the City's
reasonable actual restoration costs within thirty (30) days of
invoice. The Director may extend the cure period on good cause
shown.
4. A ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete the
necessary right-of-way restoration and maintenance because of
payment of a degradation fee or the existence of a performance
bond pursuant to Subsection (I) hereof.
Section
520.550
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.550
AO:913
H. Mapping Requirements. After the completion of ROW work, the ROW
user shall provide to the City as-built drawings, maps or other
comparable records as determined by the Director, drawn to scale and
certified to the City as reasonably depicting the location of all facilities
constructed pursuant to the ROW permit. Such records may be
provided to the Director in the form maintained by the ROW user, but
when available to the ROW user, shall be submitted in AUTOCAD.DXF,
AUTOCAD.DWG, MICROSTATION DGN (or comparable, as allowed by
the Director) automated formats, or in hard copy otherwise.
I. Performance And Maintenance Bonds.
1. Prior to any ROW work a ROW user shall establish in the City's
favor a performance and maintenance bond in an amount to be
determined by the Director to ensure the restoration of the rightsof-
way. The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of twenty-four (24) months following completion of the work. The
Director shall have the authority to extend the maintenance bond
period for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months in the same
manner as provided in Section 520.550(G)(2) hereof. The Director
may waive this requirement when the work involves no or only
minor disruption or damage to the rights-of-way. The Director shall
waive this requirement when the ROW user has twenty-five million
dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a history
of non-compliance with the provisions of this code.
2. In the event a ROW user fails to complete the ROW work in a safe,
timely and competent manner, or if the completed restorative work
fails within the time period for the bond (as determined by the
Director), then after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure,
there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal
and surety of the bond any damages or loss suffered by the City as a
result, including the full amount of any compensation,
indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property
of the ROW user and the cost of completing work within or
restoring the rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The City may also
recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a
security fund or letter of credit where such amount exceeds that
available under a security fund or letter of credit.
3. Upon completion of ROW work to the satisfaction of the Director
and upon lapse of the bond period, including any extension by the
Director, the City shall eliminate the bond.
4. The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of
insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition,
shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney and shall
contain the following endorsement:
Section
520.550
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.550
AO:914
Section 520.560. Open Books and Records. [Ord. No. 4811 §1,
2-4-2002]
"This bond may not be cancelled or allowed to lapse until sixty
(60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent
to cancel or not to renew."
5. In lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in
the City's favor such other security as the City Manager may
determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding
requirements including, but not limited to, an annual bond to be
maintained in the minimum amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00).
J. Miscellaneous.
1. Upon failure of a ROW user to commence, pursue or complete any
ROW work required by law or by the provisions of this code to be
done in any street within the time prescribed and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the City, the City may, at its option, after thirty (30)
days notice, cause such work to be done and the ROW user shall
pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by
the City to the ROW user within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such itemized report.
2. Upon ten (10) days' written notice and with the supervision of the
City, or as otherwise provided by law, a ROW user shall have the
authority to trim trees that overhang rights-of-way of the City so as
to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with
its facilities, at its own expense subject to the supervision and
direction of the City. Nothing in this Subsection shall authorize the
trimming of trees on private property without permission of the
property owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed.
3. During ROW work by a ROW user the City shall have the right to
install, and to thereafter maintain, at its own cost in any excavation
to or other applicable disturbance of the ROW any parallel facilities
of its own that do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
other facilities.
4. Nothing in this code shall be in preference or hindrance to the right
of the City and any board, authority, commission or public service
corporation of the City to use or occupy the rights-of-way or to
perform or carry on any public works or public improvements of
any description.
A. Persons subject to rental fees as provided herein shall maintain
sufficient records to document accurate payment of such rental fees
including, but not limited to, such plans, records or maps showing the
Section
520.550
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
520.560
AO:915
Section 520.570. Rental Fees. [Ord. No. 4811 §1, 2-4-2002; Ord. No.
5389, 8-20-2018]
approximate location and length of all facilities located within the
rights-of-way.
B. The City shall have the right to inspect at a location in the metropolitan
St. Louis area all records that are reasonably necessary to monitor
compliance with the terms of this code. A person having facilities within
the ROW shall be responsible for collecting and producing such
information and by registering affirms that it will do so.
C. The City Manager may require provision or retention of additional
information, records and documents from time to time as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the
rights, functions or duties of the City in connection with this code.
D. All records and information referenced herein shall be subject to
inspection and copying by the City, at no cost to the City, to ensure code
compliance. All records and information received by the City shall
remain confidential insofar as permitted by the Missouri Open
Meetings Law and other applicable State and Federal laws. If any
records cannot be copied for security or other reasons, the person
having facilities within the ROW shall nonetheless make such records
available for City inspection and shall reimburse the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in inspecting those records.
E. If any records are too voluminous, then the person may request that the
inspection take place at some other location outside the metropolitan
St. Louis area, provided that such person must pay all reasonable travel
expenses incurred by the City in inspecting those records.
A. Finding And Intent. The City finds that rights-of-way are valuable public
property acquired and maintained at great expense to taxpayers. The
City further finds that the grant of permission to locate facilities within
the rights-of-way is a valuable property right and eliminates the need to
invest substantial capital in the private location of such facilities. Any
person that places facilities within the rights-of-way after the effective
date of this code and any person that leaves existing facilities within the
rights-of-way more than ninety (90) days after the effective date of this
code shall be deemed to have agreed to pay compensation for such use
of the rights-of-way as established herein. It is the intent of this Section
that the rental fees provided for herein be applied to and be paid by
only those persons having facilities within the rights-of-way. This
Section codifies the City's long-established policy of imposing fees on
right-of-way users.
B. Payment To City. Any person having facilities within the ROW shall pay
to the City annual rent consisting of, depending on the facility, linear
foot fees and antenna fees for the use of the affected rights-of-way for
the applicable facilities.
Section
520.560
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.570
AO:916
C. Not A Tax Or In Lieu Of Any Other Tax Or Fee — Exemption Due to
Payment of Business License Taxes Or Gross Receipts Taxes.
1. The rental fees are not a tax, license or fee subject to any
requirement of voter approval, but rather constitute a charge for
special and individualized use of public property.
2. Rental fees are in addition to all other fees and all taxes and
payments that a person may be required to pay under any Federal,
State or local law, including any applicable property and
amusement taxes.
3. As provided by Section 67.1846, RSMo., no person shall be
obligated to pay rental fees if such person pays to the City gross
receipts taxes, business license fees, or business license taxes that
are more than nominal and that are imposed specifically on
communications-related revenues, services or equipment. Further,
no wireless provider shall be obligated to pay any antenna fee
hereunder.
D. Payments.
1. The rental fees shall be paid quarterly to the City and shall
commence as of the later of the effective date of this code or the
first day on which a person having facilities within the ROW places
facilities within the rights-of-way. The City shall be furnished at the
time of each payment with a statement certified by the payer's chief
financial officer or comparable officer or by an independent
certified public accountant reflecting the calculation of the total
amount of rental compensation for the payment period. Payments
shall be made to the City no later than forty-five (45) days following
the end of each calendar quarter.
2. In the event any rental fee or other payment due hereunder is not
made on or before the date specified herein, interest charges shall
also be due, computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal
to the commercial prime interest rate of the City's primary
depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed plus
a penalty of two percent (2%) of the amount.
E. No Accord Or Satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the City
shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any
claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable as rental
fees under this code or for the performance of any other obligation.
F. Audit. The City shall have the right to inspect all reasonably necessary
records and the right to audit and to recalculate any amounts
determined to be payable under this code. Persons subject to rental fees
hereunder shall be responsible for providing the records to the City at
an office located within the metropolitan St. Louis area except as
provided in Section 520.560(E). Such records shall be maintained for at
least five (5) years. The City's audit expenses shall be borne by the
Section

AO:917
Section 520.580. Insurance — Surety — Indemnification —
Penalties. [Ord. No. 4811 §1, 2-4-2002]
person audited if the rental fees paid during the audit period are less
than ninety-five percent (95%) of the amount owed according to the
audit. Any additional amounts due to the City as a result of the audit
shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the
person by the City of the underpayment, which notice shall include a
copy of the audit report. If recalculation results in an additional amount
to be paid to the City, such amount shall be subject to interest and
penalties as specified in Subsection (D)(2) above.
G. Exemption From Rental Fees.
1. Persons having facilities within the ROW pursuant to a duly issued,
lawful and applicable license or franchise shall be exempt from this
Section for the duration of such license or franchise, provided they
continue to pay on a timely basis all fees due under such license
and franchise.
2. Governmental entities having facilities within the ROW shall not be
liable for rental fees.
A. Insurance Required. All ROW users shall maintain for the duration of
any ROW work and, when applicable, for as long as the ROW user has
facilities within the rights-of-way at least the following liability
insurance coverage: Workers' Compensation and employer liability
insurance to meet all requirements of Missouri law and commercial
general liability insurance with respect to the construction, operation
and maintenance of the facilities, and the conduct of the ROW user's
business in the City, in the minimum amounts of:
1. Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for property damage resulting
from any one (1) accident;
2. Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal bodily injury or
death resulting from any one (1) accident; and
3. Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.
These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit
the liability of any person.
B. Qualifications Of Sureties. All insurance policies shall be with sureties
qualified to do business in the State of Missouri with an "A" or better
rating of insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty
Edition, and in a form approved by the City.
C. Policies Available For Review. All insurance policies shall be available
for review by the City and a ROW user having facilities within the
rights-of-way shall keep on file with the City current certificates of
insurance.
Section
520.570
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
520.580
AO:918
D. Additional Insureds — Prior Notice Of Policy Cancellation. All general
liability insurance policies shall name the City, its officers, boards,
board members, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees as
additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or
reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30) days' prior
written notice thereof has been given to the City Clerk. A ROW user
shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of
proof that it has obtained alternative insurance that complies with this
code.
E. Exemption From Insurance Requirements. The City Manager may
exempt in writing from the requirements of Sections 520.580(A)
through 520.580(D) any self-insured ROW user, provided that the ROW
user demonstrates to the City Manager's satisfaction that the ROW
user's self-insurance plan is commensurate with said requirements and
that the ROW user has sufficient resources to meet all potential risks,
liabilities and obligations contemplated by the requirements of this
code. The City Manager may require a security fund or letter of credit
as a condition to a self-insured's exemption. The City Manager shall
waive this requirement when the ROW user has twenty-five million
dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a history of
non-compliance with the provisions of this code.
F. Indemnification.
1. Any ROW user granted a ROW permit, and any person having
facilities within the rights-of-way, as partial consideration for the
privilege granted, shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify,
hold harmless and defend the City, its officials, boards, board
members, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees,
against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and
judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of:
a. Any ROW work including, but not limited to, the construction,
maintenance, repair or operation of facilities,
b. Failure to secure consents from landowners, or
c. Any actions taken or omissions made by the person pursuant to
the authority of this code.
2. The foregoing indemnity provisions include, but are not limited to,
the City's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against
any such claim, suit or proceeding prior to the person assuming
such defense. The City shall notify a person of claims and suits as
soon as practicable, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve
a person of its obligations hereunder. Once a person assumes such
defense, the City may at its option continue to participate in the
defense at its own expense.

b. Attributable to the City acting in a proprietary capacity to
deliver service(s) within the City.
G. Relation To Insurance And Indemnity Requirements. Recovery by the
City of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond or otherwise
does not limit a person's duty to indemnify the City in any way, nor shall
such recovery relieve a person of amounts owed to the City, or in any
respect prevent the City from exercising any other right or remedy it
may have.
H. Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this code shall, upon
conviction by the City's Municipal Court, be punished by a fine not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment not to
exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each
day the violation continues may be charged as a separate offense.
A. The Director shall make a final determination as to any matter
concerning the grant, denial or revocation of a ROW permit as provided
in this Article. On the request of an applicant or a ROW user and within
a reasonable period of time, the Director also shall make a final
determination as to any other issue relating to the use of the ROW, the
imposition of any fee or the application of any provision of this Article;
provided, however, that this review shall not apply to matters being
prosecuted in the municipal court. Any final determination of the
Director shall be subject to review as provided herein.
B. Any person aggrieved by the final determination of the Director may file
a petition for review pursuant to Chapter 536 of the Revised Statutes of
Missouri, as amended, in the Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis.

impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the power of eminent

enforce an exclusive contract for the provision of services with any
other person or demand the exclusive right to serve another person
or location as a condition of extending service to that person or
location or any other person or location.
2. No person shall engage in acts that have the purpose or effect of
limiting competition for the provision of services in the City, except
for such actions as are expressly authorized by law.

effective. In the event of a subsequent change in applicable law so that
the provision which had been held invalid is no longer invalid, said
provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect without further
action by the City and shall thereafter be binding.

excluded from evaluation for effects on historic properties under 47
CFR 1.1307(a)(4) of the Federal Communications Commission
rules, a wireless provider must use appropriate and reasonable,
technically feasible, non-discriminatory, and technologically
neutral design or concealment measures in a historic district, as
determined by the City Manager or his or her designee. Any such
design or concealment measures shall not have the effect of
prohibiting any provider's technology, nor shall any such measures
be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of
the size restrictions in the definition of small wireless facility.
7. Small wireless facility co-locations shall not interfere with or impair
the operation of existing utility facilities, or City or third-party
attachments. A wireless provider shall repair all damage to the
right-of-way directly caused by the activities of the wireless
provider in the right-of-way and shall return the right-of-way to its
functional equivalence before the damage under the competitively
neutral, reasonable requirements and specifications of the City. If
the wireless provider fails to make the repairs required by the City
within a reasonable time after written notice, the City may make
those repairs and charge the wireless provider the reasonable,
documented cost of such repairs.

certain individual small wireless facilities while denying
it as to others based on applicable requirements and
standards, including those identified in this Subsection.
The City's denial of any individual small wireless facility
or subset of small wireless facilities within an application
shall not be a basis to deny the application as a whole;
notwithstanding the foregoing, the FCC "shot clock"
review periods set forth in 47 CFR 1.6003 shall not be
exceeded regardless of the number of batched
applications.
l. Installation or co-location for which a permit is granted under
this Subsection shall be completed within one (1) year after the

rates, fees, and terms as provided in an agreement
between the City, or its agent, and the wireless provider
substantially in the form of Schedule C to this Section.168

a complete application. If applicable, make-ready work,
including any pole replacement, shall be completed by the City
within sixty (60) days of written acceptance of the good faith

Chapter 625
CABLE COMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY CODE
Section 625.010. General Provisions. [Ord. No. 4604 §1, 9-18-1995]
A. Title. This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Cable
Communications Regulatory Code".
B. Purpose. The City finds that further development of cable systems has
the potential to be of great benefit to the City and its residents and
businesses. Cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an
essential role as part of the City's basic infrastructure. Cable systems
extensively make use of scarce and valuable public right-of-ways, in a
manner different from the way in which the general public uses them,
and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide services to
the public, such as utility companies. A cable company currently
typically faces very limited competition; thus, the grant of a franchise
has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and
places the holder in a position of public trust. Because of these facts,
the City finds that public convenience, safety and general welfare can
best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the City or
such persons as the City so designates to protect the public and to
ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest. In
light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others, underlie the
provisions set forth in this Chapter.
1. Cable service should be available to as many City residents and
businesses as possible and provide the widest possible diversity of
information sources and services to the public.
2. A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present
and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the
community.
3. A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a
franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to
the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities, taking
into account all relevant factors including costs.
4. A cable system should grow and develop and be responsive to the
needs and interests of the community.
The City intends that all provisions set forth in this Chapter
be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing
public purposes, and that any franchise issued pursuant to this
Chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and
public purposes as integral parts thereof.

consideration of any kind or nature, received directly or indirectly, by
a franchisee or its affiliates or any person, arising from, attributable to
or in any way derived from the operation of a cable system to provide
cable services, including the studios and other facilities associated
therewith, within the City. "Gross revenues" include, by way of
illustration and not limitation, monthly fees charged subscribers for any
basic, optional, premium, per-channel, per-program or other service;
installation, disconnection, reconnection and change-in-service fees;
least channel fees; late fees and processing fees; franchise fees; fees
or payments received from programmers for carriage of programming
on the system (which does not include contributions to joint marketing

operations within and without the City of which no specific portion can
be attributed to operations in the City, "Gross revenues" with respect
to such revenues shall mean the portion thereof derived by multiplying
such revenues by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number

control of a franchisee include, but are not limited to, natural disasters,
civil disturbances, power outages in excess of two (2) hours in length,
telephone network outages and severe or unusual weather conditions.
Conditions that are within the control of a franchisee include, but

purposes for which it was dedicated, may be used for the purpose of
installing and maintaining a cable system. No reference herein, or in
any franchise agreement, to a "public right-of-way" shall be deemed to
be a representation or guarantee by the City that its interest or other
right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use
for such purposes, and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only those
rights to use as are properly in the City and as the City may have the
undisputed right and power to give.
RFP — Stands for request for proposal.
SALE — Any sale, exchange or barter transaction.
SERVICE INTERRUPTION — The loss of picture or sound on one (1) or
more cable channels.
SUBSCRIBER — Any person who legally receives any cable service

A. Grant Of Franchise. The City may grant one (1) or more cable television
franchises containing such provisions as are reasonably necessary to
protect the public interest, and each such franchise shall be awarded in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Chapter. This
Chapter may be amended from time to time, and in no event shall this
Section
625.020
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.030
AO:1066
Chapter be considered a contract between the City and a franchisee
such that the City would be prohibited from amending any provision
hereof; provided, no such amendment shall in any way impair any
contract right or increase obligations of a franchisee under an
outstanding and effective franchise except in the lawful exercise of the
City's Police power.
B. Franchise Required.
1. No person may construct, operate or maintain a cable system or
provide cable service over a cable system within the City without a
franchise granted by the City authorizing such activity. No person
may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise
agreement with the City pursuant to this Chapter. For the purpose
of this provision, the operation of part or all of a cable system
within the City means the use or occupancy by facilities of public
right-of-ways within the City whether or not any subscriber within
the City is served. A system shall be deemed as using or occupying
public right-of-ways even though such use or occupancy is solely by
reason of use of distribution facilities furnished by a telephone or
other company pursuant to tariff or contract. A system shall not be
deemed as operating within the City even though service is offered
or rendered to one (1) or more subscribers within the City, if no
public right-of-way is used or occupied. The location within the City
of a microwave or similar relay, interconnection or program
origination facility not involving the use or occupancy of public
right-of-ways shall not be deemed operation within the City. In all
respects, franchise agreements shall be issued so as to provide
equal protection under the law and to prevent unlawful disparate
treatment of persons which operate or construct cable systems or
provide cable services over a cable system.
2. To the extent a common carrier (or any other person) is providing
video programming to subscribers using radio communications,
such common carrier (or other person) must obtain a franchise as
required pursuant to this Chapter but shall not be subject to
requirements imposed by the Cable Act through this Chapter. To
the extent a common carrier is providing transmission of video
programming on a common carrier basis, such common carrier
must obtain a franchise as required pursuant to this Chapter but
shall not be subject to requirements imposed by the Cable Act
through this Chapter (but this Section shall not affect the treatment
of a facility of a common carrier as a cable system). To the extent a
common carrier (or any other person) is providing video
programming by means of an open video system pursuant to
certification approved by the FCC, such common carrier (or other
person) need not obtain a franchise pursuant to this Chapter but
shall be subject to requirements imposed by the Cable Act through
this Chapter as permitted by Federal law and shall pay to the City
fees on gross revenues for the provision of cable service equal to
Section
625.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.030
AO:1067
and in lieu of the franchise fee imposed hereunder on cable
operators in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. To
the extent that a common carrier is providing video programming
to its subscribers in a manner other than that described above in
this Subsection (2) such common carrier must obtain a franchise
as required pursuant to this Chapter and shall be subject to
requirements imposed by the Cable Act through this Chapter.
C. Length Of Franchise. No franchise shall initially be granted for a period
of more than twenty (20) years or less than four (4) years, except that a
franchisee may apply for renewal or extension pursuant to this Chapter.
D. Franchise Characteristics.
1. A franchise authorizes use of public right-of-ways for installing,
operating and maintaining cables, wires, lines, optical fiber,
underground conduit and other devices necessary and appurtenant
to the operation of a cable system to provide cable service within a
franchise area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a
franchisee to provide service to, or install a cable system on private
property without owner consent through eminent domain or
otherwise (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to and
consistent with Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section
541(a)(2), or to use publicly or privately owned poles, ducts or
conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
2. A franchise shall not mean or include any franchise, license or
permit for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business
within the City as generally required by the ordinances and laws of
the City other than this Cable Communications Regulatory Code, or
for attaching devices to poles or other structures, whether owned
by the City or other person, or for excavating or performing other
work in or along public right-of-ways. A franchise shall not confer
any authority to provide telecommunications services or any other
communications services besides cable services. A franchise shall
not confer any implicit rights other than those mandated by
Federal, State or local law.
3. A franchise is non-exclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly:
preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems
within the City; affect the City's right to authorize use of public
right-of-ways by other persons to operate cable systems or for other
purposes as it determines appropriate; or affect the City's right to
itself construct, operate or maintain a cable system with or without
a franchise.
4. Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by
the City and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall
constitute a valid and enforceable contract between the franchisee
and the City, and the terms, conditions, and provisions of such
franchise agreement, subject to this Chapter and all other duly
Section
625.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.030
AO:1068
enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and obligations
of the franchisee and the City relating to the franchise.
5. All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any
prior lawful occupancy of the public right-of-ways, and the City
reserves the right to reasonably designate where a franchisee's
facilities are to be placed within the public right-of-ways through its
generally applicable permit procedures without materially adding
to the obligations of the franchisee.
6. A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and
personal to the original franchisee. No franchise transfer shall
occur without the prior written consent of the City upon application
made by the franchisee pursuant to this Chapter and the franchise
agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
any purported franchise transfer made without application and
prior written consent shall be void and shall be cause for the City to
revoke the franchise agreement.
E. Franchisee Subject To Other Laws, Police Power.
1. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with
all applicable Federal, State and local laws, including this Chapter.
A franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the
Police power of the City, including but not limited to all rights the
City may have under 47 U.S.C. Section 552, all powers regarding
zoning, supervision of construction, assurance of equal
employment opportunities, control of public right-of-ways, and
consumer protection.
2. No course of dealing between a franchisee and the City, or any
delay on the part of the City in exercising any rights hereunder,
shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the City or
acquiescence in the actions of a franchisee in contravention of such
rights except to the extent expressly waived in writing or expressly
provided for in a franchise agreement.
3. The City shall have full authority to regulate cable systems,
franchisees and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully
permissible. Except where rights are expressly waived by a
franchise agreement, they are reserved, whether or not expressly
enumerated.
F. Interpretation Of Franchise Terms.
1. In the event of a conflict between this Chapter and a franchise
agreement, the provisions of the franchise agreement control
except where the conflict arises from the lawful exercise of the
City's Police power.
Section
625.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.030
AO:1069
2. The provisions of this Chapter and a franchise agreement will be
liberally construed in accordance with generally accepted rules of
contract construction and to promote the public interest.
G. Operation Of A Cable System Without A Franchise. Any person who
occupies public right-of-ways for the purpose of operating or
constructing a cable system or provides cable service over a cable
system and who does not hold a valid franchise from the City shall be
subject to all requirements of this Chapter, including but not limited to
its provisions regarding construction and technical standards and
franchise fees. In its discretion, the City at any time may by ordinance:
require such person to enter into a franchise agreement within thirty
(30) days of receipt of a written notice to such person from the City that
a franchise agreement is required; require such person to remove its
property and restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to the
City within such time period; grant a revocable permit to operate for a
period not to exceed two (2) years provided such period begins on the
expiration date of a franchise previously issued to such person; direct
municipal personnel to remove the property and restore the affected
area to a condition satisfactory to the City and charge the person the
costs therefor, including by placing a lien on the person's property as
provided in connection with abating nuisances; or take any other action
it is entitled to take under applicable law. In no event shall a franchise
be created unless it is issued by ordinance of the City pursuant to this
Chapter and subject to a written franchise agreement.

impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the City's power of eminent
domain.

serve a person or location, as a condition of extending service to
that or any other person or location.
2. No franchisee or other multichannel video programming

Transfer of Franchises. [Ord. No. 4604 §4, 9-18-1995; Ord. No. 4642
§1, 8-19-1996]
A. Written Application.
1. A written application shall be filed with the City Clerk for: grant of
an initial franchise; renewal of a franchise under 47 U.S.C. Section
546(a) — (g) or Section 546(h); modification of a franchise
agreement; or franchise transfer. An applicant shall demonstrate in
its application compliance with all requirements of this Chapter
and all applicable laws.
2. To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall
be submitted together with ten (10) copies. The application must be
accompanied by the required filing fees, conform to any applicable
request for proposals, and contain all required information. All
applications shall include the names, addresses and telephone
numbers of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant
with respect to the application.
3. All filed applications shall be made available by the City Clerk for
public inspection. Each filed application shall be reviewed promptly
by the City for completeness.
B. Application For Grant Of A Franchise, Other Than A Cable Act Renewal
Franchise.
1. Upon receipt of an application for a franchise other than a Cable
Act renewal franchise, the City Council may commence a
proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests
of the community. Upon completion of that proceeding, or after
receipt of the application if no such proceeding is commenced, the
City Council shall either evaluate the application or issue an RFP,
which shall be mailed to the applicant and made reasonably
available to any other interested person. The procedures,
instructions and requirements set forth in an RFP shall be followed
by each applicant as if set forth and required herein. The City may
seek additional information from any applicant and establish
deadlines for the submission of such information. If the City issues
an RFP, it shall evaluate all timely responses.
2. In evaluating an application for a franchise including a response to
an RFP, the City shall consider, among other things, the following
factors:
a. The extent to which the applicant substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any franchises in
other communities.
b. Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any
franchises in other communities, including signal quality,
Section
625.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.040
AO:1071
response to customer complaints, billing practices and the
like, was reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the
communities served.
c. Whether there is adequate assurance that the applicant has
the financial, technical and legal qualifications to provide cable
service in the City.
d. Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the City and is otherwise reasonably likely to
meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs
and interests.
e. Whether there is adequate assurance the applicant will provide
suitable public, educational and governmental access facilities.
f. Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted and in the public
interest considering the immediate and future effect on the
public right-of-ways that would be used by the cable system,
including the extent to which installation or maintenance as
planned would require replacement of property or involve
disruption of property, public services or use of the public
right-of-ways.
g. Whether the applicant or an Affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other cable system in the City, or whether grant of
the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the
delivery of cable service in the City.
3. If the City Council finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise considering the factors set forth above, the City shall
prepare a final written franchise agreement under this Chapter
that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by the
applicant and establish a deadline for the applicant to sign it and
submit it for approval. If the applicant signs the franchise
agreement and timely submits it for approval, the City shall issue a
franchise by ordinance adopted no less than thirty (30) days after
the filing of the original application.
4. If the City Council denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision
explaining why the franchise was denied.
5. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the City
Council shall hold a public hearing; however, the City may reject
without hearing any application that is incomplete or fails to
respond fully to an RFP.
6. This Chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant
standing to challenge the issuance of a franchise to another person,
or to limit such standing.
Section

RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section

AO:1072
C. Application For Grant Of A Cable Act Franchise Renewal. Applications
for franchise renewal under the Cable Act shall be received and
reviewed in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47
U.S.C. Section 546. If neither a franchisee nor the City activates in a
timely manner, or can activate, the renewal process set forth in 47
U.S.C. Section 546(a) — (g) (including, for example, if the provisions are
repealed), and except as to applications submitted pursuant to 47
U.S.C. Section 546(h), the provisions of Section 4(b) shall apply and a
renewal request shall be evaluated using the same criteria as any other
request for a franchise. The following requirements shall apply to
renewal requests properly submitted pursuant to the Cable Act:
1. Renewal requests.
a. If the provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 546 (a) — (g) are properly
invoked, the City Council shall, in accordance with the time
limits of the Cable Act, commence and complete a proceeding
to review the applicant's performance under the franchise
during the then current franchise term and to identify future
cable-related community needs and interests. Upon completion
of the proceeding, the City Council may issue a RFP. The City
Council, or its designee, shall establish deadlines and
procedures for responding to the RFP, may seek additional
information from the applicant, and shall establish deadlines
for the submission of such additional information.
Alternatively, an applicant can submit a proposal for renewal
on its own initiative.
b. Following receipt of renewal proposals (and such additional
information as may be provided in response to requests), the
City Council will provide prompt public notice of such
proposals and thereafter either determine that the franchise
should be renewed or make a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed. This determination shall be
made in accordance with the time limits established by the
Cable Act, including sufficient time to comply with the
following procedures.
c. If the City Council preliminarily determines that the franchise
should not be renewed, which determination can be made by
resolution, and the applicant that submitted the renewal
proposal notifies the City Clerk in writing within twenty (20)
days after receipt of the preliminary determination that it
wishes to pursue any rights to an administrative proceeding it
has under the Cable Act, then, if required, the City Council
shall commence an administrative proceeding after providing
prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the Cable Act.
The City may also commence such a proceeding on its own
initiative if it so chooses.
Section
625.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.040
AO:1073
d. If the City Council decides to grant renewal, which decision
shall be made by resolution, the City shall prepare a final
written franchise agreement that incorporates, as appropriate,
the commitments made by the applicant in the renewal
proposal and establish a deadline for the applicant to sign it
and submit it for approval. If the applicant signs the franchise
agreement and timely submits it for approval, the City shall
issue a franchise by ordinance. If the franchise agreement is
not so accepted and approved within the time limits
established by 47 U.S.C. Section 546(c)(1) and the City,
renewal shall thereupon be deemed preliminarily denied, and
if the applicant notifies the City Clerk in writing within twenty
(20) days after the expiration of the time limit established by
47 U.S.C. Section 546(c)(1) that it wishes to pursue any rights
to an administrative proceeding it has under the Cable Act,
then, if required, the City Council shall commence an
administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice
thereof, in accordance with the Cable Act. The City may also
commence such a proceeding on its own initiative if it so
chooses.
2. If an administrative proceeding is commenced pursuant to 47
U.S.C. Section 546(c), the applicant's renewal proposal shall be
evaluated considering such matters as may be considered
consistent with Federal law. The following procedures shall apply:
a. The City Council shall, by resolution, appoint an administrative
hearing officer or officers (referred to hereafter as "hearing
officer"). The City Council may appoint itself or one (1) or more
of its members as hearing officer or any other qualified person.
b. The hearing officer shall establish a schedule for proceeding
which allows for written discovery (requests for admissions,
production of documents and interrogatory responses),
production of evidence, and subpoenaing and crossexamination
of witnesses. Depositions shall not be permitted
unless the party requesting the deposition shows that written
discovery and hearing subpoena will not provide it an adequate
opportunity to require the production of evidence necessary to
present its case. The hearing officer shall have the authority to
require the production of evidence as the interests of justice
may require, including to require the production of evidence by
the applicant that submitted the renewal proposal and any
affiliate of such applicant. The hearing officer shall not prohibit
discovery on the ground that evidence sought is proprietary or
involves business secrets, but rather shall issue protective
orders which allow reasonable and necessary discovery
without making such information available to competitors. Any
order of the hearing officer may be enforced by imposing
Section
625.040
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.040
AO:1074
appropriate sanctions in the administrative hearing or by
action of the City Council.
c. The hearing officer may conduct a pre-hearing conference and
establish appropriate pre-hearing orders. The City and the
applicant shall be the only parties. The City may have special
counsel to represent its interests at the hearing so that the City
Attorney may advise the City Council as it makes its decision.
d. The hearing officer may require the City and the applicant to
submit prepared written testimony prior to the hearing. Unless
the parties agree otherwise, the applicant shall present
evidence first (1st), the City shall present evidence second
(2nd), and the applicant shall be allowed the opportunity to
present rebuttal evidence. Any reports or the transcript or
summary of any proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C.
Section 546(a) shall for purposes of the administrative hearing
be regarded no differently than any other evidence. The City
and the applicant must be afforded full procedural protection
regarding evidence related to these proceedings, including the
right to refute any evidence introduced in these proceedings or
sought to be introduced by the other party. Both shall have the
opportunity to submit additional evidence related to issues
raised in the proceeding conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C.
Section 546(a).
e. There shall be a transcribed proceeding during which each
party will be allowed to present testimony (live, or written if so
required) and cross-examine the witnesses of the other party.
f. Following completion of any hearing, the hearing officer shall
require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact with
respect to the matters that the City Council is entitled to
consider in determining whether renewal ought to be granted.
Based on the record of the hearing, the hearing officer shall
then prepare written findings with respect to those matters,
and submit those findings including a decision and the reasons
therefor, to the City Council and to the parties (unless the
hearing officer is the City Council, in which case the written
findings shall constitute the final decision of the City).
g. If the hearing officer is not the City Council, the parties shall
have thirty (30) days from the date the findings are submitted
to the City Council to file exceptions to those findings. The City
Council shall thereafter issue a written decision granting or
denying the application for renewal, consistent with the
requirements of the Cable Act, based on the record of such
proceeding, stating the reason for the decision. A copy of the
final decision of the City Council shall be provided to the
parties.
Section
625.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.040
AO:1075
h. The proceeding shall be conducted with due speed. Any
decision to renew a franchise shall be made by ordinance
enacted no less than thirty (30) days after the filing of the
application and subsequent to preparation of a written
franchise agreement consistent with the decision by the City
and signature thereof by the applicant.
i. In conducting the proceeding, and except as inconsistent with
the foregoing, the hearing officer will follow the Missouri
Administrative Procedures Act, as amended. The hearing
officer may request that the City Council adopt additional
reasonable and necessary procedures and requirements by
resolution.
3. This Section does not prohibit any franchisee from submitting or
the City from considering an informal renewal application pursuant
to 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h), which application may be granted or
denied in accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section
546(h). If such an informal renewal application is granted,
including during the course of formal renewal proceedings, then
the steps specified in Subsections (c) (1) and (c) (2) of this Section
need not be taken, notwithstanding the provisions of those
Subsections. However, the City will provide the public with
adequate notice before making a decision on such an application,
and will make any decision to renew by ordinance enacted no less
than thirty (30) days after the filing of the application, and
subsequent to the preparation of a written franchise agreement by
the City and signature thereof by the applicant. Unless otherwise
directed by the City, an informal renewal application shall contain
the information required under Section 625.040(D).
4. The provisions of this Chapter shall be read and applied so that
they are consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C.
Section 546, as amended.
D. Contents Of Franchise And Renewal Applications. An RFP for the grant
of a franchise, including for a franchise renewal shall require, and any

Section
625.040
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.040
AO:1078
b. The justification for the requested modification, including the
impact of the requested modification on subscribers and

review and make its decision by ordinance enacted no less than
thirty (30) days after the application is filed, subsequent to

prior written application to and written approval of the City Council
by ordinance enacted after a public hearing, and only then upon
such terms and conditions as the City Council reasonably deems
necessary and proper. Approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Any purported franchise transfer made without such
prior approval shall be void and shall be cause for the City to
revoke the franchise agreement. A grant of a franchise involves
personal credit, trust and confidence in the franchisee, and
franchise transfer without the prior written approval of the City
Section
625.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.040
AO:1079
Council shall be considered to impair the City's assurance of due
performance. The granting of approval for a franchise transfer
in one (1) instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any
subsequent franchise transfer.
2. Application.
a. The franchisee shall promptly notify the City Clerk in writing of
any proposed franchise transfer. If any franchise transfer
should take place without prior notice to the City, the
franchisee will promptly notify the City Clerk in writing that
such a franchise transfer has occurred.
b. At least one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the
contemplated effective date of a franchise transfer, the
franchisee shall submit to the City Clerk an application for
approval of the franchise transfer. Such an application shall
provide information on the proposed transaction, including
details on the legal, financial, technical, and other
qualifications of the transferee, any waivers required from the
City under applicable law, and on the potential impact of the
franchise transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a
minimum, the following information must be included in the
application:
(1) All information and forms required under Federal law;
(2) All information described in Sections 625.040(D)(1) — (5),
(9), (11), (13) — (15) of this Chapter, regarding the
transferee instead of the applicant, and regarding the
franchise transfer rather than initial or renewal franchise;
(3) A description of any business relationships or transactions
of any kind, past, present or anticipated, between the
franchisee, or its owners or affiliates, and the transferee,
or its owners or affiliates, other than the proposed
transaction;
(4) Any contracts, financing documents or other documents
that relate to the proposed transaction, and all documents,
schedules, exhibits or the like referred to therein;
(5) A description of the sources and amounts of the funds to
be used in the proposed transaction, indicating how the
debt-equity ratio of the system will change in the course of
the transaction; what entities will be liable for repayment
of any debt incurred; what interest, payment schedule, and
other terms or conditions will apply to any debt financing;
any debt coverages or financial ratios any potential
transferees will be required to maintain over the franchise
term if the proposed transaction is approved; what
Section
625.040
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.040
AO:1080
financial resources would be available to the system under
the control of the proposed transferee;
(6) Any other information necessary to provide a complete and
accurate understanding of the financial position of the
system before and after the proposed franchise transfer,
including but not limited to projected income statements
and cash flow statements, including capital investments,
for at least five (5) years after the proposed franchise
transfer, assuming the franchise transfer is approved,
stating specifically what assumptions are being made with
respect to any rebuild or upgrade of the system; and
(7) A statement that the franchisee is in compliance with its
franchise obligations over the term of the franchise, or
specific descriptions of any non-compliance of which the
franchisee or any potential transferee is aware.
c. For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a
franchise transfer, the City Council and its agents may inquire
into the qualifications of the prospective transferee and such
other matters as the City Council may deem necessary to
determine whether the franchise transfer is in the public
interest and should be approved or denied. The franchisee and
any prospective transferees shall assist the City Council in any
such inquiry, and if they fail to reasonably cooperate, the
request for approval of franchise transfer may be denied.
Proprietary information shall be protected from disclosure to
competitors to the extent permitted by law.
3. Determination by City.
a. In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny or
grant subject to conditions an application for approval of a
franchise transfer, the City Council shall consider the legal,
financial and technical qualifications of the transferee to
operate the system; whether any required waivers under
applicable law are in the best interests of the public; whether
the franchisee is in compliance with its franchise agreement
and this Chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's
commitment to cure such non-compliance; and whether
operation by the transferee on approval of the franchise
transfer would adversely affect the City's interest under this
Chapter, the franchise agreement, other applicable law, or the
public interest, or make it less likely that the future cablerelated
needs and interests of the community would be
satisfied.
b. The City shall make its determination in accordance with any
time limits imposed by Federal law, including under 47 U.S.C.
Section 537 (e).
Section
625.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.040
AO:1081
c. Any purported franchise transfer made without the City
Council's prior written approval shall be void, and shall make a
franchise subject to revocation at the City Council's sole
discretion, and make any other remedies available to the City
under the franchise or other applicable law. Acceptance of
filing of an application for approval of a franchise transfer later
than one hundred twenty (120) days before the purported
effective date of the franchise transfer shall not validate the
transaction or excuse the late filing, and in such an instance
the City shall retain the right to make its decision regarding
such a franchise transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days
unless action is required sooner by law.
4. Transferee's agreement. No application for approval of a franchise
transfer shall be granted unless and until the proposed transferee
submits an agreement in writing that it will abide by and accept all
terms of this Chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will
assume the obligations and liabilities, known and unknown, of the
previous franchisee under this Chapter and the franchise
agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless the City
Council approves a modification of the franchise agreement
pursuant to Section 625.040(E) in conjunction with its approval of
the franchise transfer, in which case the proposed transferee's
agreement shall refer to the franchise agreement as so modified.
5. Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the City Council
of a franchise transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of
any of the rights of the City under this Chapter or a franchise
agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the
franchise transfer; however, upon approval of a franchise transfer,
the former franchisee shall be released from prospective liability
under the franchise.
G. Filing Fees And Deposits. To be acceptable for filing, an application
under this Section 625.040 shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the
following amounts to cover the City's internal administrative costs
incidental to the franchising process:
1. For an initial franchise: $1,000.00.
2. For renewal of a franchise under 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) — (g):
$1,000.00.
3. For renewal of a franchise under 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h): $500.00.
4. For modification of a franchise agreement: $500.00.
5. For approval of a franchise transfer: $500.00.

9-2-1997]
public proceedings of the City shall be published and posted in
accordance with its usual practices.
I. Intergovernmental Cooperation. By resolution of the City Council, any
part or all of the process established by this Section 625.040 may be
conducted in concert with other political subdivisions served or to be
served by the applicant.
A. System Construction Schedule. Every franchise agreement shall specify
the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction,
upgrade or rebuild of the cable system. Failure on the part of a
franchisee to commence and diligently pursue such requirements and
complete the matters set forth in its franchise agreement or to comply
with the system design and construction plan submitted to the City,
including by providing the equipment specified (or its equivalent) and
by following generally accepted installation practices (except insofar as
those plans or practices, if carried out, would result in construction of a
system which could not meet requirements of Federal, State or local
law; and except for such minor modifications as are typical in the
industry), shall be grounds for revocation of its franchise under and
pursuant to the terms of Section 625.120(E); provided however, that the
City Council in its discretion may extend the time for the completion of
construction and installation for additional periods by resolution in the
event a franchisee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of
circumstances beyond its control and requests such an extension in
writing. A franchisee's failure to comply with provisions of the
construction plan approved by the City Council shall also be grounds for
imposition of penalties pursuant to Section 625.120(H).
B. Construction Procedures.
1. A franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain the cable system
subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the City who
have jurisdiction in such matters and in compliance with all laws,
ordinances, departmental rules and regulations affecting the
system.
2. The system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to periodic
inspection by the City.
3. No construction, reconstruction or relocation of the system or any
part thereof within the public right-of-ways shall be commenced
until written permits have been obtained from the proper City
Officials. In any permit so issued, such officials may impose such
conditions and regulations as a condition of granting of the permit
as are reasonably necessary for the purpose of protecting any
structures or facilities in the public right-of-ways and for the proper
Section
625.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.050
AO:1083
restoration of such public right-of-ways and structures and
facilities, and for the protection of the public and the continuity of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Such system construction permits
shall be applied for, issued, supervised and administered in
accordance with the procedures established for facilities work
permits under the Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Usage Code.
4. The City Council may by resolution or ordinance, from time to time,
issue such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the
construction, operation and maintenance of the system as are
consistent with the provisions of this Chapter and franchises issued
pursuant to this Chapter.
C. Construction Standards.
1. The construction, operation, maintenance and repair of a cable
system shall be in accordance with all applicable Sections of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical
Safety Code, the National Electric Code, National Cable Television
Association Standards of Good Engineering Practices; Obstruction
Marking and Lighting, Federal Aviation Administration;

regulations that may apply to the operation, construction,
maintenance or repair of a cable system, including, without
limitation, local zoning and construction Codes, and laws and
accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or
adopted. In the event of a conflict among Codes and standards, the
most stringent Code or standard shall apply (except insofar as that
Code or standard, if followed, would result in a system that could
not meet requirements of Federal, State or local law). The City may
adopt additional reasonable standards as required to ensure that
work continues to be performed in an orderly and workmanlike
manner, or to reflect changes in standards which may occur over a
franchise term.
2. All wires, cable lines and other transmission lines, equipment and
structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum
interference with the rights and convenience of property owners,
including the City.
3. All electronic equipment shall be of good and durable quality.

RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.050
AO:1084
applicable Federal, State or local laws, Codes and regulations, all
as hereafter may be amended or adopted.
5. Without limiting the foregoing, all of a franchisee's plant and
equipment including, but not limited to, the antennae site, headend
and distribution system, towers, house connections, structures,
poles, wires, cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, fixtures and
apparatuses shall be installed, located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained and
operated in accordance with good engineering practices performed
by experienced and properly trained maintenance and construction
personnel so as not to endanger any person or property or to
unreasonably interfere in any manner with the public right-of-ways
or legal rights of any property owner including the City or
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
6. All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A
franchisee shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices to prevent failures and accidents that are
likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
7. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where
they will interfere with any cable, gas, electric, telephone, water,
sewer or other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner
the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the City
of their use of any public right-of-ways.
8. Any and all public right-of-ways, public property or private property
disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair,
replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance or construction of

protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove
discrete portions of its property when required by the City by
reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way
construction; public right-of way maintenance or repair (including
resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade;
construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of governmentowned
communications system, public work or improvement or any
government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any
other purpose where the convenience of the City would be
reasonably served thereby; provided however, that the franchisee
may abandon any property in place if approved by the City in
writing, and provided further that the franchisee shall not be
required to make permanent changes in its facilities to
accommodate the installation of another cable system, nor should it
be required to make temporary changes solely to disrupt its
Section
625.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.050
AO:1085
business or otherwise provide an unfair advantage to a competitor.
No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of the property
of a franchisee and a franchisee shall not be entitled to any
compensation therefor. No location of any pole or wire-holding
structure of a franchisee shall be a vested interest.
10. If any action under the preceding paragraph is reasonably required
to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the
facilities of another person that is authorized to use the public
right-of-ways, a franchisee shall, after thirty (30) days' advance
written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes
requested. The franchisee shall be reimbursed by such other
person for costs reasonably incurred in taking such action. The City
Council may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs
associated with the removal, relaying or relocation of facilities as
among entities authorized to install facilities in the public right-ofways
if the parties are unable to do so themselves, and if the matter
is not governed by a valid contract between the parties.
11. In the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is
contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property,
the City may remove, relay or relocate the pertinent parts of that
cable system without prior notice. No charge shall be made by
franchisee against the City for restoration and repair.
12. A franchisee shall, on the request of the City or any person holding
a permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to
permit the moving of buildings or oversized vehicles. The expense
of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be
paid by the person requesting same, and the franchisee shall have
the authority to require such payment in advance, except in the
case where the request is made by the City on its own behalf, in
which case no such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall
be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice to
arrange for such temporary wire changes unless the City Council
has declared an emergency.
13. A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang a
public right-of-way of the City so as to prevent the branches of such
trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the
franchisee, at its own expense subject to the supervision and
direction of the City. Trimming of trees on private property shall
require written permission of the property owner. All cut materials
shall be properly disposed.
14. A franchisee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing
underground conduits or overhead utility facilities whenever
feasible and may not erect poles in public right-of-ways without the
express written permission of the City Council, which permission
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Copies of agreements for use of
Section
625.050
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.050
AO:1086
conduits or other facilities shall be filed with the City Clerk as
required by a franchise agreement or upon City request.
15. Trunk, feeder and drop cable may be constructed overhead where
poles exist and electric, cable television or telephone lines are
overhead, but where no overhead lines exist all trunk, feeder and
drop cable shall be constructed underground. Whenever and
wherever all electric lines and telephone lines are moved from
overhead to underground placement, all cable system cables shall
be similarly moved and the cost of movement of its cable shall be
solely the obligation of the franchisee. In cases of new construction
or property development where utilities are to be placed
underground, on request of franchisee the developer or property
owner shall give a franchisee reasonable notice of the particular
date on which open trenching will be available to franchisee for
installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults and laterals to be
provided at the franchisee's expense. The franchisee shall also
provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching
and easements required to bring facilities within the development
shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if
the franchisee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults
and laterals within five (5) working days of the date the trenches
are available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or
property owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five
(5) day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by the
franchisee.
16. The City shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge
upon any poles or within any conduit owned by a franchisee any
wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the
cable system operations of the franchisee.
17. Prior to construction or rebuild of a cable system, a franchisee shall
first submit to the City Council for approval a concise description of
the cable system proposed to be erected or installed, including
engineering drawings, if required by the City Council, together
with a map and plans indicating the proposed location of all such
facilities and obtain written approval therefor from the City
Council, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
18. Any contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction,
installation, operation, maintenance or repair of system equipment
must be properly licensed under laws of the State and all applicable
local ordinances, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have
the same obligations with respect to its work as a franchisee would
have under the franchise agreement and applicable laws if the
work were performed by the franchisee. The franchisee must
ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all employees who will
perform work for it are trained and experienced. The franchisee
shall be responsible for ensuring that the work of contractors and
subcontractors is performed consistent with the franchise and
Section
625.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.050
AO:1087
applicable law, shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions
of contractors or subcontractors, shall be responsible for promptly
correcting acts or omissions by any contractor or subcontractor,
and shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the
work is properly performed.
19. Upon failure of a franchisee to commence, pursue or complete any
work required by law or by the provisions of this Chapter to be
done in any street, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the City, the City may, at its option, after thirty (30)
days' notice to franchisee, cause such work to be done and the
franchisee shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized
amounts reported by the City to franchisee within thirty (30) days
after receipt of such itemized report.
20. The franchisee shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts except after
written permission has been give by the City, which permission
shall not unreasonably be withheld.
21. The franchisee shall install in conduit all cable passing under any
major roadway.
D. Area Served. A franchisee shall build and maintain its system so that
within a reasonable period of time, as established by the franchise, it is
able to provide service to all households desiring service located within
the franchise area without any construction charges (other than
standard connection charges and drop charges as indicated in Section
625.050(E)(2)). A franchisee must build and maintain its system so that
it can extend service to households desiring service located outside the
franchise area in accordance with Section 625.050(E)(1) through (4).
Connections to commercial customers shall be governed by Section
625.050(E)(5).
E. Line Extension Requirements.
1. a. a For areas within the City limits but outside the franchise
area, including areas annexed after the effective date of its
franchise, a franchisee shall upon request of the City Council
extend its trunk and distribution system to serve households
desiring service without any construction charge (other than
standard connection charges and drop charges as indicated in
Section 625.050(E)(2)), unless the franchisee demonstrates to
the City Council's satisfaction evidenced by written decision
that circumstances justify a specific charge, where: the new
subscriber requesting service is located within five hundred
(500) feet from the termination of the cable system, or the
number of potential subscribers to be passed by such extension
is equal to or greater than six (6) potential households per
quarter mile measured from any point on the system.
b. In the event that the requirements set forth in the foregoing
paragraph (a) are not met, the franchisee shall on request of
Section
625.050
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.050
AO:1088
the City Council extend its cable system based upon the
following cost-sharing formula. The franchisee shall contribute
an amount equal to the construction costs per mile multiplied
by the length of the extension in miles, multiplied by a fraction
where the numerator equals the number of potential
households per quarter mile at the time of the request and the
denominator equals six (6). Households requesting service as
of the completion of construction can be required to bear the
remainder of the total construction costs on a pro rata basis.
The "construction costs" are defined as the actual turnkey cost
to construct the entire extension including lines, materials,
electronics, pole make-ready charges and labor, but not the
cost of drops except as provided below. If the franchisee
proposes to require a household requesting extension to make
a contribution in aid of extension, it must (1) notify the City
Council in advance; (2) send the City Council a copy of the
invoice showing the amount actually charged each household
requesting extension; and (3) within thirty (30) days of
completion of the extension, furnish proof of the total cost of
the extension and make any appropriate refunds if the total
cost is less than the amounts charged in advance of
construction. At the end of each calendar year, the franchisee
must calculate the amount any contributing person would have
paid based on the number of persons served at that time and
pay back the difference between the amount actually collected
from that person and the amount which would then be owed.
The franchisee shall report such calculations and refunds to
the City Clerk by the end of January of the following year.
2. Installation of drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may
otherwise require, the franchisee shall not assess any additional
cost for service drops of one hundred fifty (150) feet or less unless
the franchise demonstrates to the City Council's satisfaction,
evidenced by written decision, that circumstances justify a specific
charge. Where a drop exceeds one hundred fifty (150) feet in
length, a franchisee may charge the subscriber for the difference
between franchisee's actual costs associated with installing a one
hundred fifty (150) foot drop, and the franchisee's actual cost of
installing the longer drop, provided that drop length shall be the
shorter of (1) the actual length of installed drop or (2) the shortest
practicable distance to the point where the franchisee would be
required to extend its distribution system.
3. Location of drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may
otherwise require, in any area where a franchisee would be entitled
to install a drop above ground, the franchisee will provide the
subscriber the option to have the drop installed underground but
may charge the subscriber the difference between the actual cost
Section
625.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.050
AO:1089
of the above-ground installation and the actual cost of the
underground installation.
4. Time for extension. A franchisee must extend service to any person
who requests it (1) within seven (7) days of the request within the
franchise area or where service can be provided by activating or
installing a drop within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the existing
distribution system; (2) within thirty (30) days of the request for
service outside the franchise area where an extension of one-half
(½) mile or less (but more than 150 feet) is required; or (3) within
six (6) months for service outside the franchise area where an
extension of one-half (½) mile or more is required.
5. Because existing conditions can vary dramatically, franchisee may
in its discretion require commercial customers to pay all
reasonable costs of connection (including time and materials) in
excess of the average cost of connection for residential services.
F. System Tests And Inspections.
1. Tests. A franchisee shall perform the following tests to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of the franchise and other
performance standards established by Federal law. All tests shall
be conducted in accordance with Federal rules and in accordance
with the most recent edition of NCTA's "Recommended Practices
for Measurements on Cable Television Systems" or, if no recent
edition exists, such other appropriate manual as the parties may
designate.
a. Pre-construction quality control on cable and equipment. A
franchisee shall perform preconstruction quality tests on
system components. In case of passive components, this will
include testing a significant sample of devices to verify
compliance with manufacturer's specifications.
(1) All trunk and distribution cable shall be sweep-tested on
the reels to verify compliance with manufacturer's
specifications for frequency response and loss.
(2) All trunk and distribution amplifiers shall be bench-tested
to verify compliance with manufacturer's specifications.
(3) No component shall be used in the system which fails to
meet manufacturer's specifications. A franchisee shall
maintain in the metropolitan St. Louis area records of all
pre-construction tests, which the City may inspect during
normal business hours on reasonable notice.
b. Acceptance tests. A franchisee shall perform acceptance tests
prior to subscriber connection. The tests shall demonstrate
that the system components are operating as expected. The
test results shall be submitted to the City Clerk for review by
Section
625.050
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.050
AO:1090
the City. The franchisee shall have the obligation, without
further notice from City, to take corrective action if any system
components are not operating as expected. Unless the City
determines test results are not adequate to demonstrate
system compliance with the standards described above and
objects within three (3) working days of receipt of the test
results, the portion of the system covered by the tests will be
deemed approved for subscriber connection.
c. Continuing tests.
(1) The franchisee shall select locations at the extremities of
the system to install equipment to establish sufficient
permanent test points in accordance with Federal law and
sound engineering practices. The franchisee shall perform
proof of performance tests at these locations at least once
every six (6) months through the life of the franchise
except as Federal law otherwise limits its obligation and at
other times and points where complaints indicate tests are
warranted. The tests shall demonstrate system compliance
with technical specifications established pursuant to
franchise or other applicable law. If the City requests to
witness the tests, it shall be notified in writing delivered to
the City Clerk at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of
any testing.
(2) A written report of all test results shall be filed with the
City Clerk within thirty (30) days of each test. If the
location fails to meet performance specifications, the
franchisee, without requirement of additional notice or
request from City, shall take corrective action, retest the
location and advise the City of the action taken and results
achieved by writing filed with the City Clerk. The City shall
have the option of witnessing such follow-up tests and
shall be notified in writing delivered to the City Clerk at
least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of any such followup
testing.
(3) At any time after commencement of service to subscribers
the City may require additional tests, full or partial repeat
tests, different test procedures, or tests involving a
specific subscriber's terminal. Requests for such
additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints
received or other evidence indicating an unresolved
controversy or significant non-compliance, and such tests
will be limited to the particular matter in controversy. The
City may conduct such tests independently on three (3)
days' advance notice to franchisee. The City will endeavor
to so arrange its requests for such special tests so as to
minimize hardship or inconvenience to the franchisee and
the subscriber(s).
Section
625.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.050
AO:1091
d. All reports of test results shall include executive summaries.
e. Test procedures used in verification of the performance
criteria set forth herein, if not as set forth in Section 76.609,
Subpart K of the FCC Rules and Regulations, shall be in
accordance with good engineering practice and shall be fully
described in an attachment to the annual certificate filed with
the City.
f. To the extent that the report of measurements as required
above may be combined with any reports of measurements
required by the FCC or other regulatory agencies, the City
shall accept such combined reports, provided that all
standards and measurements herein or hereafter established
by the City are satisfied.
2. Inspections. The City may conduct inspections of the system,
including to assess compliance with the construction and
installation practices manuals and design plans. The franchisee
shall be notified in writing of any violations found during the course
of inspections. The franchisee must bring violations into
compliance within thirty (30) days of the date notice of violation is
given and must submit a report to the City Clerk describing the
steps taken to bring itself into compliance. Inspection does not
relieve the franchisee of its obligation to build in compliance with
all provisions of the franchise.
G. Use Of Public Property.
1. Should the grades or boundaries of the public right-of-ways which
the franchisee is authorized to use and occupy be changed at any
time during the term of the franchise granted, the franchisee shall,
if necessary, at its own cost and expense, relocate or change its
system so as to conform with the new grades or boundaries.
2. Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage
system or to any City, State or other public structures or facilities in
the public right-of-ways required on account of the construction of
the system in the public right-of-ways shall be made at the sole cost
and expense of the franchisee. During any work of constructing,
operating or maintaining of the system, the franchisee shall also, at
its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures
and facilities belonging to the City and any other person. All work
performed by the franchisee pursuant to this Section shall be done
in such reasonable manner prescribed by the City or other officials
having jurisdiction thereover.
H. Interference With Public Projects. Nothing in this Chapter shall be in
preference or hindrance to the right of the City and any board,
authority, commission or public service corporation to perform or carry
on any public works or public improvements of any description.
Section
625.050
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.050
AO:1092
I. Publicizing Proposed Construction Work. Unless not possible due to
emergency circumstances, franchisee shall publicize proposed
construction work at least ten (10) days prior to commencement of that
work by causing written notice of such construction work to be
delivered to the City Clerk. In addition, unless not possible due to
emergency circumstances, before entering onto any person's property,
a franchisee shall contact the property owner or occupant at least one
(1) day in advance. If a franchisee must enter a private building, it must
have permission of the owner or occupant.
J. System Maintenance.
1. Interruptions to be minimized. A franchisee shall schedule
maintenance so that activities likely to result in an interruption of
service are performed during periods of minimum subscriber use of
the system.
2. Maintenance practices. In addition to its other obligations, a
franchisee shall:
a. Use replacement components of good and durable quality, with
characteristics better or equal to replaced equipment; and
b. Follow the more stringent of maintenance standards specified
in the franchise agreement, cable televisions industry
maintenance standards or franchisee's maintenance
standards.
K. Continuity Of Service.
1. It shall be the right of all persons in a franchisee's franchise area to
receive all available services from the franchisee as long as their
financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied, and
subject to reasonable construction standards and schedules, and
subject to availability of legal access to the location.
2. A franchisee shall make every reasonable effort to provide all
subscribers with continuous uninterrupted service. At the City's
request, a franchisee shall operate its system for a temporary
period under a revocable permit granted expressly by ordinance or
tacitly following the termination of its franchise or franchise
transfer as necessary to maintain service to subscribers and shall
cooperate with the City to assure an orderly transition from it to
another franchisee or system operator (the "transition period").
The transition period shall be no longer than the reasonable period
required for another franchisee to commence service and shall not
be longer than two (2) years. During the transition period, the
franchisee shall continue to be obligated to comply with the terms
and conditions of its franchise agreement and applicable laws and
regulations and will thereupon continue to receive operating
revenues during such transition period.

requirements as may be established through the application process
and incorporated in its franchise agreement including but not limited to
those pertaining to public, educational and governmental access
facilities, every franchisee shall comply with the conditions set forth in
this Section, except as prohibited by Federal law.
B. Full Service To Municipal Buildings. A franchisee shall, on request of
the City, install, at no charge, at least one (1) service outlet at all City
buildings and (all primary and secondary education public and private
schools within the private franchise area and shall install and charge
only its reasonable costs for any additional service outlets requested for
such locations, so long as such additional installations will not interfere
with the quality and operation of the franchisee's system or signal
thereon, and the quality and manner of installation of such additional
outlets shall have been approved by the franchisee (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall comply with all City, State
and Federal laws and regulations. The franchisee shall provide basic
cable service and expanded basic cable service to all outlets in such
buildings free of charge. A franchise may specify other requirements
regarding the availability of facilities for municipal use.
C. Cable Channels For Commercial Use, Local Commercial Television
Signals And Non-Commercial Educational Television. A franchisee shall
designate channel capacity for commercial and non-commercial use by
persons unaffiliated with the franchisee as required by Federal law,
consistent with the principle of fairness and equal accessibility to all
persons and the City to the extent they have a legitimate use for such
capacity.

capable of providing power to the system for a minimum of two (2)
hours in the event of an electrical outage, plus adequate portable
generators to cover longer outages. The obligation to provide
backup power supplies requires the franchisee to install equipment

time to interconnect or rescind its request to interconnect upon its
own initiative or upon petition by the franchisee to the City Council.

interconnection would cause an unreasonable increase in
subscriber rates.
4. No interconnection shall take place without prior written approval
of the City Council. A franchisee seeking approval for
interconnection shall demonstrate that all signals to be
interconnected will comply with FCC technical standards for all
classes of signals and will result in no more than a low level of
distortion.

less than three percent (3%) of the time. These standards shall be
met ninety percent (90%) of the time, measured quarterly. When
the business office is closed, an answering machine or service
capable of receiving and recording service complaints and

at a time convenient to the customer.
2. Subscribers who have experienced two (2) missed appointments
due to the fault of a franchisee shall receive installation free of
charge, if the appointment was for installation. If an installation

provided that a franchisee shall complete the work in the shortest
time possible where, for reasons beyond the franchisee's control,
the work could not be completed in those time periods even with
the exercise of all due diligence; the failure of a franchisee to hire

franchisee's failure to comply with this provision. Except as Federal
law permits, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this
service, unless required due to damage caused by a subscriber.

any Federal agency, State or franchising authority on the
transaction between the franchisee and the subscriber.
3. All franchisee promotional materials, announcements, and

charge, in order to receive the services selected. No charge may be
made for any service or product that the subscriber has not
affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive. Payment of the regular

franchisee shall, not later than thirty (30) days before such
premium channel is provided without charge, notify all subscribers

including the time period involved, notify all Subscribers they have
a right to request that the premium channel be blocked, and block
the premium channel upon the request of a subscriber. For

Ord. No. 4642 §1, 8-19-1996]
I. Subscriber Control. A franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws
regarding subscriber ability to block audio and/or video signals.
A. The City reserves the right to regulate service and equipment rates to
the maximum degree permitted by applicable State and Federal law.
Each franchisee shall comply with all such regulation provisions that
the City may adopt and all Federal laws regarding rates. Failure to
comply shall constitute a material violation of a franchise.
B. Ordinance No. 4656 establishes procedures and standards for the
regulation of rates for basic cable television and cable programming
services and equipment. These regulations are on file in the office of the
City Clerk.
A. Finding. The City finds that public right-of-ways of the City to be used
by a franchisee or any other person for the provision of cable service
over a cable system are valuable public property acquired and
maintained by the City at great expense to taxpayers. The City further
finds that the grant of a franchise to use public right-of-ways is a
valuable property right without which a franchisee would be required
to invest substantial capital.
B. Payment To City. As compensation for use of the public right-of-ways, a
franchisee and any other person providing cable service over a cable
system shall pay the City franchise fees. Every franchise agreement
shall specify the amounts a franchisee is initially required to pay as a
percentage of gross revenues, but if the specified amount is less than
the maximum or if the maximum amount permitted increases, the City
may increase it to any amount up to the maximum allowed by law after
sixty (60) days' notice to the franchisee, so long as the increase may by
law be passed on to subscribers.
C. Not A Tax Or In Lieu Of Any Other Tax Or Fee.
1. The franchise fee is not a tax, license or fee subject to any
requirement of voter approval, but rather is a rental charge for
special and individualized use of public property.
2. The franchise fee is in addition to all other fees and all taxes and
payments that a franchisee or other person may be required to pay
under any Federal, State or local law, including any applicable
property and amusement taxes, except to the extent that such fees,
taxes or assessments are a franchise fee under 47 U.S.C. Section
542.
D. Payments.
Section
625.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.100
AO:1107
1. The franchise fees and any other costs or penalties assessed by the
City against a franchisee or any other person shall be paid
quarterly to the City and shall commence as of the effective date of
a franchise. The City shall be furnished at the time of each payment
with a statement certified by the franchisee's or other person's
respective chief financial officer or an independent certified public
accountant reflecting the total amount of gross revenues for the
payment period. Payments shall be made to the City no later than
thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar quarter.
2. In the event any franchise fee or other payment is not made on or
before the date specified herein, the franchisee and any other
person shall pay interest charges computed from such due date, at
an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the
City's primary depository bank during the period such unpaid
amount is owed, plus two percent (2%) of the amount due to defray
the City's additional expenses by reason of the delinquency.
E. No Accord Or Satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the City
shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any
claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable as
franchise fees under this Chapter or for the performance of any other
obligation of a franchisee or other person.
F. Audit.
1. The City shall have the right to inspect all reasonably necessary
records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts
determined to be payable under this Chapter. The franchisee shall
be responsible for providing the records to the City at an office
located within the metropolitan St. Louis area. Such records shall
be maintained for at least five (5) years. The City's audit expenses
shall be borne by the franchisee if the franchise fees paid during
the audit period are less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of the
amount owed according to the audit. Any additional amounts due to
the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days
following written notice to the franchisee by the City of the
underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report. If recomputation results in additional revenue to be paid to
the City, such amount shall be subject to interest as specified in
Section 625.100(D)(2). All costs incurred by a franchisee
hereunder are not franchise fees and fall within one (1) or more of
the exceptions set forth in 47 U.S.C. Section 542(g)(2) and shall not
be passed on to the subscribers in any form.
2. A franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records and have
all relevant fiscal and financial records maintained by others on its
behalf in such a manner as to enable the City to determine the cost
of assets of the franchisee which are used in providing services
within the City and to determine gross revenues.

name and address of each and every person providing
telecommunications and other communications services over the
cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not
received by the franchisee, as well as all such services being
provided by the franchisee in addition to cable services unless
franchisee already has a separate written franchise or license from
the City to provide such other services.
A. Insurance Required. A franchisee shall maintain and by its acceptance
of a franchise specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the
entire length of the franchise period, at least the following liability
insurance coverage insuring the City and the franchisee: Workers'
Compensation and employer liability insurance to meet all
requirements of Missouri law and comprehensive general liability
insurance with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance
of the cable system, and the conduct of the franchisee's business in the

1. One million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for property damage resulting
from any one (1) accident;
2. Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal bodily injury or
death resulting from any one (1) accident; and
3. Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.
These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit
the liability of a franchisee for damages under any franchise
issued hereunder.
B. Qualifications Of Sureties. All insurance policies shall be with sureties
qualified to do business in the State of Missouri, with an B+7 or better
rating of insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/ Casualty
Edition, and in a form approved by the City.
C. Policies Available For Review. All insurance policies shall be available
for review by the City, and a franchisee shall keep on file with the City
certificates of insurance.
D. Additional Insureds — Prior Notice Of Policy Cancellation. All general
liability insurance policies shall name the City, its officers, boards,
board members, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees as
additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or
reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30) days' prior
written notice thereof has been given to the City Clerk. A franchisee
shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of
proof that the franchisee has obtained alternative insurance reasonably
satisfactory to the City Council which complies with this Chapter.

E. Failure Constitutes Material Violation. Failure to comply with the
insurance requirements set forth in this Section shall constitute a
material violation of a franchise.
F. Indemnification.
1. A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless and defend the City, its officials, boards, board members,
commissions, commissioners, agents and employees, against any
and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments
for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction,
maintenance or operation of its cable system; copyright
infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents
from the owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs
to be delivered by the cable system; the conduct of the franchisee's
business in the City; or in any way arising out of the granting of a
franchise or a franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a franchise
granted hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter
or a franchise agreement.
2. Specifically, but not by way of limitation on the scope of (1) above, a
franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the City, and in their capacity as such,
the officers, agents, and employees thereof, from and against any
and all claims, suits, actions, liability and judgments for damages or
otherwise subject to Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section
558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of the installation,
construction, operation or maintenance of its system, including but
not limited to any claim against the franchisee for invasion of the
right of privacy, defamation of any person, or the violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service
mark or patent, or of any other similar right of any person. This
indemnity does not apply to programming carried on any channel
set aside for public, educational or government use, or channels
leased pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 532, unless the franchisee was
in any respect engaged in determining the editorial content of the
program, or pre-screened the programming for the purported
purpose of banning or regulating indecent or obscene
programming.
3. The indemnity provision includes, but is not limited to, the City's
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such
claim, suit or proceeding prior to franchisee assuming such
defense. The City shall notify a franchisee of claims and suits as
soon as practicable, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve
a franchisee of its obligations hereunder. Once a franchisee
assumes such defense, the City may at its option continue to
participate in the defense at its own expense.

Section 625.120. Performance Guarantees and Remedies. [Ord. No.
4604 §12, 9-18-1995]
4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Chapter, the City shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in
relation to any amounts attributable to the City's own negligence,
willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, including in the
performance of its obligations under this Chapter or a franchise
agreement.
A. Security Fund.
1. Prior to a franchise becoming effective and on each anniversary
date thereafter during the franchise term including the date of
termination, the franchisee shall post with the City Clerk sufficient
funds to serve as a cash security deposit to be used as a security
fund to ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of and
compliance with all provisions of this Chapter, the franchise
agreement and other applicable law, and compliance with all
orders, permits, and directions of the City, and the payment by the
franchisee of any claims, liens, fees or taxes due the City which
arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of
the system. The amount of the security fund on deposit shall be
equal to three percent (3%) of the franchisee's projected annual
gross revenues for the upcoming year, or in the instance of the final
deposit, three percent (3%) of the actual gross revenues for the
preceding year.
2. In lieu of a cash security fund, a franchisee may file and maintain
with the City Clerk an irrevocable letter of credit with a surety
acceptable to the City in the amount specified in the preceding
paragraph to serve the same purposes as set forth therein. Said
letter of credit shall remain in effect for the full term of the
franchise plus an additional six (6) months thereafter, or longer if
there is any outstanding obligation or default on the part of the
franchisee, as determined by the City Council. The franchisee and
its surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the
letter of credit for the franchisee's failure to ensure its faithful
performance of and compliance with all provisions of this Chapter,
the franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance
with all orders, permits, and directions of the City, and the payment
by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the City
which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or
maintenance of the system. The letter of credit shall provide for
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the City of any intention on
the part of the franchisee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise
materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of a letter of credit with
the City, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the City
thereunder, shall be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by
the franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under the
Section
625.110
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.120
AO:1111
terms of its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the
letter of credit or otherwise.
3. The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are
in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by this
Chapter or authorized by other law or a franchise agreement, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such
security fund or letter of credit will affect any other right the City
may have.
4. The following procedures shall apply to drawing on the security
fund and letter of credit:
a. If the franchisee fails to make timely payment to the City of any
amount due as a result of a franchise, fails to make timely
payment to the City of any amounts due under a franchise
agreement or applicable law, fails to make timely payment to
the City of any taxes due, or fails to compensate the City within
ten (10) days of written notification that such compensation is
due for any damages, costs or expenses the City suffers or
incurs by reason of any act or omission of the franchisee in
connection with its franchise agreement or the enforcement of
its franchise agreement, the City may withdraw the amount
thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund
or from funds available under the letter of credit.
b. Within three (3) days of a withdrawal from the security fund or
under the letter of credit, the City shall mail, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, written notification of the amount,
date and purpose of such withdrawal to the franchisee.
c. If, at the time of a withdrawal from the security fund and under
the letter of credit by the City, the amounts available are
insufficient to provide the total payment towards which the
withdrawal is directed, the balance of such payment shall
continue as the obligation of the franchisee to the City until it
is paid.
d. No later than thirty (30) days after mailing of notification to the
franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
withdrawal under the security fund or letter of credit, the
franchisee shall deliver to the City for deposit in the security
fund an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn or shall
restore the letter of credit. Failure to make timely delivery of
such amount to the City or to restore the letter of credit shall
constitute a material violation of the franchise.
e. Upon termination of the franchise under conditions other than
those stipulating forfeiture of the security fund, the balance
then remaining in the security fund shall be withdrawn by the
City and paid to the franchisee within six (6) months of such
Section
625.120
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.120
AO:1112
termination, provided that there is then no outstanding
obligation or default on the part of the franchisee.
5. In addition to or in lieu of a security fund or letter of credit, a
franchise may require such guarantees as the City deems to be in
the public interest.
B. Performance Bond.
1. Prior to any cable system construction, upgrade, or other such
work in the public right-of-ways, a franchisee shall establish in the
City's favor a performance bond to ensure the franchisee's faithful
performance of the construction, upgrade or other work. The
amount of such performance bond shall be equal to ten percent
(10%) of the total cost of the work unless otherwise specified in the
franchise agreement.
2. In the event a franchisee subject to such a performance bond fails
to complete the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work
in the public right-of-ways in a safe, timely, and competent manner,
after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, there shall be
recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of
the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result,
including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or
cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee,
or the cost of completing or repairing the system construction,
upgrade, or other work in the public right-of-ways, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of
the bond. The City may also recover against the bond any amount
recoverable against a security fund where such amount exceeds
that available under a security fund.
3. Upon completion of the system construction, upgrade, or other
such work in the public right-of-ways and payment of all
construction obligations of the cable system to the satisfaction of
the City Council, the City Council shall eliminate the bond after a
time appropriate to determine whether the work performed was
satisfactory, which time shall be established considering the nature
of the work performed.
4. The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with an B+7 or
better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/
Casualty Edition; shall be subject to the approval of the City
Attorney; and shall contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be cancelled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty
(60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent
to cancel or not to renew."

AO:1113
C. Failure Constitutes Material Violation. Failure to maintain a required
security fund, letter of credit or performance bond shall constitute a
material violation of a franchise.
D. Remedies. In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity,
the City may apply any one (1) or a combination of the following
remedies in the event a franchisee violates this Chapter, its franchise
agreement, other applicable ordinances or applicable State or Federal
law:
1. Revoke the franchise or shorten the term pursuant to the
procedures specified in this Chapter.
2. Impose penalties available under Section 625.120(H) and other
applicable State and local laws for violation of City ordinances.
3. In addition to or instead of any other remedy, seek legal or
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
4. Apply any remedy provided for in a franchise agreement, including
enforcing provisions, if any.
E. Shortening, Revocation Or Termination Of Franchise.
1. The City shall have the right to shorten the term of a franchise to a
term not less than thirty-one (31) months from the date of the
action shortening the franchise term, or to revoke the franchise, for
a franchisee's substantial and ongoing failure to construct, operate
or maintain the cable system as required by this Chapter or a
franchise agreement; for defrauding or attempting to defraud the
City or subscribers; if the franchisee is declared bankrupt; or for
any other substantial and ongoing material violation of this Chapter
or substantial and ongoing material violation of a franchise
agreement. To invoke the provisions of this Section, the City
Council shall give the franchisee written notice of such intent. If
within thirty (30) calendar days following such written notice from
the City to the franchisee, the franchisee has not completed
corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and
expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of the City Council, the
City Council may give written notice to the franchisee of its
decision to commence a proceeding to consider shortening the
term of or revoking the franchise, stating its reasons; provided that
no opportunity to cure shall be afforded in the event the franchisee
is declared bankrupt. Revocation for bankruptcy shall be governed
by Section 625.120(E)(3).
2. Prior to shortening the term of or revoking a franchise, the City
Council shall hold a public hearing, after giving at least fifteen (15)
calendar days' notice by posting and publication, at which time the
franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
Following the public hearing, the City Council may determine
whether to shorten the franchise term or to revoke the franchise
Section
625.120
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.120
AO:1114
based on the information presented at the hearing and other
information of record. If the City Council determines to shorten a
franchise term or revoke a franchise, it shall make such decision by
ordinance setting forth the reasons for its decision. The City may
make such decision conditional on a franchisee's failure to resolve
outstanding problems or take appropriate steps to resolve such
problems within a specific period of time. A copy of such decision
shall be provided to the franchisee.
3. Any franchise may, at the option of the City Council following a
public hearing, be revoked by ordinance one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of
the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action
or proceeding, unless within that one hundred twenty (120) day
period:
a. Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been
vacated; or
b. Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this Chapter and the existing franchise
agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a
court of competent jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the
existing franchise agreement.
c. In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of a material
portion of the facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee
(other than pursuant to a pledge or mortgage which qualified
as a exception to the definition of a "franchise transfer" and
after which the franchise transfer was ultimately approved),
the City Council may revoke the franchise, following a public
hearing before the City Council, by serving notice on the
franchisee and the successful bidder, in which event the
franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be
revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after
serving such notice, unless:
(1) The City Council has approved the franchise transfer; and
(2) The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the
City to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions
of the franchise agreement and this Chapter.
4. If the City Council revokes a franchise, if a franchise expires, or if
for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to
operate or maintain service to its subscribers after notice and
reasonable opportunity to cure of at least thirty (30) days, the
following procedures and rights are effective:
Section
625.120
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
625.120
AO:1115
a. The City Council may require the former franchisee to remove
its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense.
If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable
period of time, the City Council may have the removal done at
the former franchisee's or surety's expense. In removing its
plant, structures and equipment, the franchisee shall refill, at
its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and
shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as
prevailed prior to the franchisee's removal of its equipment
and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone
cable wires or attachments. The City shall inspect and approve
the condition of the public ways and public places; and cables,
wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability,
indemnity and insurance as provided herein shall continue in
full force and effect during the period of removal and until full
compliance by the franchisee with the terms and conditions of
this paragraph and this Chapter. In the event of a failure by the
franchisee to complete any such work or any other work
required by City law or ordinance within the time as may be
established and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City, the
City may cause such work to be done and the franchisee shall
reimburse the City the reasonable cost thereof within thirty
(30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs.
b. At the expiration of the term for which any franchise is granted
(if renewal is either not sought or denied) the City, at its
election, shall have the right to purchase and take over all or
any part of a cable system located within the City upon the
payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to the fair market
value of the system or the part taken (based on system value as
a going concern). In the event of revocation, as provided for in
this Chapter, the City at its election shall have the right to
purchase and take over all or any part of a cable system
located within the City upon payment to franchisee of a sum
equal to an equitable price for the system or the part taken. If
the City elects to purchase only a part of the system, the fair
market value shall include both the fair market value of the
part purchased together with the diminution in value of the
part not purchased. The price for the cable system or the part
taken shall not include, and the franchisee shall not receive,
anything for the value allocated to the franchise itself unless
such valuation is now or subsequently provided for by the
Cable Act or in the franchise itself. Upon the exercise of the
option by the City and its service of an official notice of such
action upon the franchisee, the franchisee shall immediately
transfer to the City possession and title to all of the purchased
facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system
with any existing liens and encumbrances (provided the City
can require application of purchase price to such liens and
encumbrances at closing); and the franchisee shall execute
Section
625.120
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
625.120
AO:1116
such warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to
the City as shall be reasonably necessary for this purpose.
Each contract entered into by franchisee with reference to its
operations under the franchise shall be subject to the exercise
of this option by the City.
c. If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee during the
franchise term, or if the franchisee fails to operate its system in
accordance with this Chapter during any transition period, or
the franchisee otherwise terminates the franchise, upon
decision of the City Council made after providing the
franchisee reasonable notice of at least thirty (30) days and an
opportunity to be heard, the ownership of all portions of the
cable system in public right-of-ways shall revert to the City and
the City may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of
the system, or the City Council, at its option, may operate the
system, designate another entity to operate the system
temporarily until the franchisee restores service under
conditions acceptable to the City or until the franchise is
revoked and a new franchisee selected by the City is providing
service, seek an injunction requiring the franchisee to continue
operations, and/or seek to recover all damages sustained as a
result of such abandonment or failure to operate. A franchisee
retains all rights to contest such actions and all rights to
compensation provided by law.
A franchisee shall be deemed to have abandoned its system, or
failed to operate its system during any transition period, if:
(1) The franchisee fails to provide cable service in accordance
with its franchise over a substantial portion of the cable
system for ninety-six (96) consecutive hours, unless the
City Council authorizes a longer interruption of service in
writing; or
(2) The franchisee, for any period, willfully and without cause
refuses to provide Cable service in accordance with its
franchise over a substantial portion of the cable system.
5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, where the
City has issued a franchise requiring the completion of
construction, system upgrade, or other specific obligation by a
specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such
construction or upgrade, or to comply with such other specific
obligations as may be required, within such time limits, as same
shall be extended by the City Council for good cause shown by the
franchisee, will result in the forfeiture of the franchise upon
decision of the City Council made after providing the franchisee
with reasonable notice of at least thirty (30) days and an
opportunity to be heard.

Section 625.130. Rights of Individuals Protected. [Ord. No. 4604
§13, 9-18-1995]
F. Remedies Cumulative. All remedies under this Chapter and the
franchise agreement are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated.
The exercise of one (1) remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor
shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of penalties relieve a
franchisee of its obligations to comply with its franchise. Remedies may
be used alone or in combination as permitted by law; in addition, the
City may exercise any rights it has at law or equity.
G. Relation To Insurance And Indemnity Requirements. Recovery by the
City of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond, a security
fund or letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a franchisee's duty to
indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a
franchisee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed

thereupon return to full force and effect without further action by the
City and shall thereafter be binding on the franchisee and the City.
K. Effective Date. This Chapter shall become effective on the thirty-first

channels for non-commercial public, educational, or governmental

each such channel to subscribers. The City must deliver and submit
to the video service provider all transmissions of PEG content and
programming in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted
and transmitted by such video service provider holder over its
network without further alteration or change in the content or
transmission signal. Such content and programming must be
compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the video
service provider to deliver its video services. The video service
provider shall cooperate with the City to allow the City to achieve
such compatibility.
4. The City shall make the programming of any PEG access channel
available to all video service providers in a non-discriminatory
manner. Each video service provider shall be responsible for
providing the connectivity to the City's or its duly appointed agent's

2007. Where technically necessary and feasible, video service
providers shall use reasonable efforts and shall negotiate in good
faith to interconnect their video service networks on mutually
acceptable rates, terms, and conditions for the purpose of
transmitting PEG programming. A video service provider shall have
no obligation to provide such interconnection to a new video
service provider at more than one (1) point per headend, regardless
of the number of political subdivisions served by such headend. The
video service provider requesting interconnection shall be
responsible for any costs associated with such interconnection,
including signal transmission from the origination point to the
point of interconnection. Interconnection may be accomplished by
direct cable microwave link, satellite, or other reasonable method
of connection acceptable to the person providing the interconnect.

monetary and other support for PEG access facilities existing on
August 27, 2007, shall continue until the date of franchise
expiration (ignoring any termination by notice of issuance of a
video service authorization) or January 1, 2012, whichever is
earlier. Any other video service provider shall have the same
obligation to support PEG access facilities as the incumbent cable
operator, but if there is more than one (1) incumbent, then the
incumbent with the most subscribers as of August 27, 2007. Such
obligation shall be pro-rated, depending on the nature of the

B. ROW permits.
1. Application requirements.
a. Any person desiring to perform ROW work must first apply for
and obtain a ROW permit, in addition to any other building
permit, license, easement, franchise, or authorization required
by law. In the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the
person conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify
the City of the location of the work and shall apply for the
required ROW permit as soon as practicable following the
commencement of the work, not to exceed the third business
day thereafter. The Director may design and issue general
permits for Emergency ROW work for several different
locations or throughout the City.
b. An application for a ROW permit shall be submitted to the
Director. The Director may design and make available standard
forms for such applications, requiring such information as
allowed by law and as the Director determines in his or her
discretion to be necessary and consistent with the provisions of
this Chapter and to accomplish the purposes of this Chapter.
Each application shall at minimum contain the following
information for the proposed ROW work, unless otherwise
waived by the Director:
(1) The name, address and telephone number of a
representative whom the City may notify or contact at any
time (i.e., twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days
per week) concerning the work;
(2) If different from the applicant, the name, address, and
telephone number of the person on whose behalf the
proposed work is to be performed;
(3) A description of the proposed work, including a conceptual
master plan and an engineering site plan or other
technical drawing or depiction showing the nature,
dimensions, location, and description of the applicant's
proposed work or facilities, their proximity to other
facilities that may be affected by the proposed work, and
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1132
the number of street crossings and their locations and
dimensions, if applicable;
(4) Projected commencement and termination dates and
anticipated duration of the work or, if such dates are
unknown, a representation that the applicant shall provide
the Director with reasonable advance notice of such dates
once they are determined;
(5) Copies of any required certificates of insurance or
performance and maintenance bonds.
c. The information required by the application may be submitted
in the form maintained by the applicant, provided it is
responsive to the application's requirements, and the applicant
shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to complete the
application based on the amount of data or information
requested or required.
d. Each such application shall be accompanied by the following
payments:
(1) An application fee approved by the City to cover the cost of
processing the application;
(2) Any other amounts due to the City from the applicant,
including but not limited to prior delinquent fees, costs,
and any loss, damage, or expense suffered by the City
because of the applicant's prior work in the rights-of-way
or for any emergency actions taken by the City, but the
Director may modify this requirement to the extent the
Director determines any such fees to be in good-faith
dispute.
e. Applicants shall participate in any joint planning, construction
and advance notification of such work, including coordination
and consolidation of any excavation of or disturbance to the
rights-of-way, as directed by the Director. When deemed
necessary to accomplish the goals of this Section and to the
extent permitted by law, the City reserves the right, when
feasible and reasonable, to require the sharing of facilities by
ROW users. Applicants shall cooperate with each other and
other ROW users and the City for the best, most efficient, least
intrusive, most aesthetic, and least obtrusive use of the rightsof-
way.
f. The Director shall establish procedures allowing applicants to
ascertain whether existing capacity may be available from
other persons utilizing the rights-of-way along the intended
path of any proposed work. The Director shall also maintain
indexes of all ROW permits issued, both by the ROW user and
by the affected rights-of-way.
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.030
AO:1133
2. Application review and determination.
a. The Director shall promptly review each completed application
for a ROW permit and shall grant or deny all such applications
as provided herein within thirty-one (31) days of receipt
thereof. Unless the application is denied, the Director shall
issue a ROW permit upon determining that the applicant has
submitted all necessary information, has paid the appropriate
fees and is in full compliance with this Chapter and all other
City ordinances. The Director may establish procedures for
bulk processing of applications and periodic payment of fees to
avoid excessive processing and accounting costs.
b. It is the intention of the City that interference with, damage to,
excavation or disruption of, or the placement of facilities within
the City's rights-of-way should be minimized and limited in
scope to the extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of
this Chapter. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish
such purposes, the Director may require as alternatives to the
proposed ROW work either less disruptive methods or different
locations for facilities, provided that any required alternative
shall not increase expenses by more than ten percent (10%) of
the applicant's costs for the work as proposed, shall not result
in a decline of service quality, and shall be competitively
neutral and non-discriminatory. The Director shall justify to the
applicant that the required alternative is reasonable and
necessary.
c. Upon receipt of an application, the Director shall determine
whether any portion of the rights-of-way will be affected by the
proposed work and whether the interference, disruption, or
placement of facilities will be more than minor in nature. In
determining whether the proposed work is more than minor in
nature, the Director shall consider the nature and scope of the
work, its location and duration, and its effect on the rights-ofway,
the use thereof, and neighboring properties.
(1) If the applicant can show to the Director's reasonable
satisfaction that the work involves no interference,
disruption, excavation, or damage to, or only minor
interference with, the rights-of-way or that the work does
not involve the placement of facilities or involves timesensitive
maintenance, then the Director shall promptly
grant the ROW permit.
(2) If the Director determines that the effect on the rights-ofway
will be more than minor in nature and no exemption
under the above Subsection (B)(2)(c)(1) or any other
provision of this Chapter applies, the Director shall
schedule and coordinate the work and grant the ROW
permit accordingly. When reasonable and necessary to
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1134
accomplish the purposes of this Chapter, the Director may
postpone issuance of a ROW permit, and may give public
notice of the application in an attempt to identify whether
other person(s) intend to do work in the same area within
a reasonable period of time, so that all ROW work in the
area can be coordinated. Due regard shall be accorded
applicants that are required by any law, rule, regulation,
license, or franchise to provide service to the area defined
in the application. The Director shall not impose any
coordination or scheduling requirements that prevent or
unreasonably delay an applicant's access to the ROW or
that create a barrier to entry.
d. Each ROW permit issued by the Director shall include:
(1) Projected commencement and termination dates or, if such
dates are unknown at the time the permit is issued, a
provision requiring the ROW user to provide the Director
with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they
are determined;
(2) Length of affected rights-of-way, number of road crossings,
and identification and description of any pavement or curb
cuts included in the work;
(3) Information regarding scheduling and coordination of
work, if necessary;
(4) The location of any of the applicant's facilities, both those
proposed and existing, and the location of any known
facilities owned by another person that may be affected by
the proposed work;
(5) An acknowledgement and representation by the applicant
to comply with the terms and conditions of the ROW
permit and this Chapter; and
(6) Such conditions and requirements as are deemed
reasonably necessary by the Director to protect structures
and other facilities in the rights-of-way from damage, to
restore such rights-of-way, and any structures or facilities,
to ensure the reasonable continuity and sight lines of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and to protect property
values, the aesthetics of adjoining properties and
neighborhoods, and the public health, safety and welfare.
e. The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be
in the public interest, for the following reasons:
(1) Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.030
AO:1135
(2) Failure to provide information required by the application
or this Chapter;
(3) The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this
Chapter or other pertinent and applicable City ordinances;
(4) Failure to return the ROW to its previous condition under
previously issued ROW permits or after prior excavations
by the applicant;
(5) For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural
sensitivity, as defined by applicable Federal, State or local
law;
(6) For the applicant's refusal to comply with alternative ROW
work methods, locations, or other reasonable conditions
required by the Director; and
(7) For any other reason to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, provided that such denial does not fall within
the exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service
Commission or interfere with a ROW user's right of
eminent domain of private property, and provided further
that such denial is imposed on a competitively neutral and
non-discriminatory basis.
3. Permit revocation and ordinance violations.
a. The Director may revoke a ROW permit without fee refund
after notice and an opportunity to cure, but only in the event of
a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the permit
or this Chapter. Prior to revocation the Director shall provide
written notice to the ROW user identifying any substantial
breach and allowing a reasonable period of time not longer
than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure period
may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to
protect the public safety. The cure period shall be extended by
the Director on good cause shown by the ROW user. A
substantial breach includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(1) A material violation of a provision of the ROW permit or
this Chapter;
(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of
the ROW permit or this Chapter, or the perpetration or
attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or
its residents;
(3) A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW permit
application;
(4) A failure to complete ROW work by the date specified in
the ROW permit, unless an extension is obtained or unless
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1136
the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond
the ROW user's control; and
(5) A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and
opportunity to cure as specified by the Director, work that
does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances,
industry construction standards, this Chapter or any other
applicable ordinances, provided that City standards are no
more stringent than those of a national safety ordinance.
The duty to properly install any facilities to the standards
mentioned above shall remain with the installer.
b. Any breach of the terms and conditions of a ROW permit shall
also be deemed a violation of this Chapter, and in lieu of
revocation the Director may initiate prosecution of the ROW
user for such violation.
C. Work In The ROW.
1. Jurisdiction, inspection and stop-work orders.
a. All facilities and ROW work shall be subject to inspection by
the City and the supervision of all Federal, State and local
authorities having jurisdiction in such matters to ensure
compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, departmental
rules and regulations, and the ROW permit.
b. The Director shall have full access to all portions of the ROW
work and may issue stop-work orders and corrective orders to
prevent unauthorized work or substandard work as established
in Subsection (C)(7) hereof. Such orders:
(1) May be delivered personally or by certified mail to the
address(es) listed on the application for the ROW permit or
the person in charge of the construction site at the time of
delivery;
(2) Shall state that substandard work or work not authorized
by the ROW permit is being carried out, summarize the
substandard or unauthorized work and provide a period of
not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which
cure period may be immediate if certain activities must be
stopped to protect the public safety; and
(3) May be enforced by equitable action in the Circuit Court of
St. Louis County, Missouri, and in such case the person
responsible for the substandard or unauthorized work
shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the
City in enforcing such orders, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, in addition to any and all penalties
established in this Chapter.
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.030
AO:1137
2. Underground facilities.
a. In conjunction with the City's long-standing policy favoring
underground construction, no person may erect, construct or
install new poles or other facilities above the surface of the
rights-of-way without the written permission of the City, unless
the City's authority has been preempted by State or Federal
law. Such permission may be granted through a ROW permit
when other similar facilities exist above ground or when
conditions are such that underground construction is
impossible, impractical or economically unfeasible, as
determined by the City, and when in the City's judgment the
aboveground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the
area where the construction is proposed.
b. During installation of facilities and to the extent authorized by
law, existing underground conduits shall be used whenever
feasible and permitted by the owner thereof.
c. In the case of new construction or property development, the
developer or property owner shall give reasonable written
notice, to other potential ROW users as directed by the City, of
the particular date on which open trenching will be available
for installation of facilities. Costs of trenching and easements
required to bring facilities within the development shall be
borne by the developer or property owner; except that if the
facilities are not installed within five (5) working days of the
date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice
given by the developer or property owner, then once the
trenches are thereafter closed, the cost of new trenching shall
be borne by the person installing the facilities.
3. Aboveground facilities.
a. The Director may designate certain locations or facilities in the
ROW to be excluded from use by the applicant for its facilities,
including, but not limited to:
(1) Ornamental or similar specially designed street lights;
(2) Designated historic areas;
(3) Facilities, equipment, structures, or locations that do not
have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the
proposed facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or
wind loading thereof;
(4) Facilities, equipment, structures, or locations that in the
reasonable judgment of the Director are incompatible with
the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe or
unstable by the installation; and
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1138
(5) Facilities, equipment, structures, or locations that have
been designated or planned for other use or are not
otherwise available for use by the applicant due to
engineering, technological, proprietary, legal, or other
limitations or restrictions.
b. Aboveground facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be
bright, reflective, or metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be
considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with
the surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the
facilities. Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to
reduce or eliminate their visibility. A sight-proof landscape
screen may be required for any authorized aboveground
facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or covering in
excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such screening shall be
sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan
identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall
be approved by the Director prior to installation of any facility
requiring landscape screening. The person having facilities
within the ROW shall be responsible for the installation, repair,
or replacement of screening materials. Alternative screening
or concealment may be approved by the Director to the extent
it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements.
c. Aboveground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive
noise and shall comply with all other applicable regulations
and standards established by the City or State or Federal law.
d. If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for
aboveground facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts
with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the
Director shall cooperate in good faith with the applicant to
attempt to find suitable alternatives, but such alternatives may
exceed the cost increase limitation established by Section
630.030(B)(2)(b), and the City shall not be required to incur
any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the applicant.
4. Relocation of equipment and facilities.
a. In the event of an emergency, or where construction equipment
or facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger
to health, safety, or property, the City may, to the extent
allowed by law, remove, re-lay, or relocate such construction
equipment, or the pertinent parts of such facilities, without
charge to the City for such action or for restoration or repair.
The City shall attempt to notify the person having facilities
within the ROW prior to taking such action, but the inability to
do so shall not prevent same. Thereafter, the City shall notify
the person having facilities within the ROW as soon as
practicable.
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.030
AO:1139
b. At the City's direction, all facilities shall be moved
underground, and the cost shall be solely the obligation of the
person having facilities within the ROW (or as otherwise
allowed or required by law).
c. At the City's direction, a person having facilities within the
ROW shall protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or remove
facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to
accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion,
relocation, or maintenance of streets or other public works or
to protect the ROW or the public health, safety, or welfare.
d. A person having facilities within the ROW shall, on the
reasonable request of any person and after reasonable advance
written notice, protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or
remove facilities to accommodate such person, and the actual
cost, reasonably incurred, of such actions shall be paid by the
person requesting such action. The person having facilities
within the ROW taking such action may require such payment
in advance.
e. Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW
user may abandon the facilities if approved by the City as
provided in Subsection (C)(6) of this Section.
f. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property, and
no person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No
location of any facilities within the rights-of-way shall be a
vested interest.
5. Property repair and alterations.
a. During any ROW work, the person doing the work shall protect
from damage any and all existing structures and property
belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all rightsof-
way, public property, or private property disturbed or
damaged during the work shall be repaired or replaced by the
person doing the work or the person on whose behalf the work
is being done, and such person shall immediately notify the
owner of the fact of any damaged property. Such repair or
replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time
specified by the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
b. Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or
drainage system or to any City, state or other public structures
or facilities in the rights-of-way required on account of the
construction, installation, repair or maintenance of facilities
within the rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and
expense of the Owner of such facilities.
6. Removal, abandonment, transfer, and relocation of facilities.
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1140
a. If a person having facilities within the ROW installs the
facilities within the ROW without having complied with the
requirements of this Chapter or abandons the facilities, the
City may require the removal of the facilities, remove the
facilities at the expense of the person having facilities within
the ROW, or require the transfer of the facilities as provided
herein.
b. If the City requires removal of the facilities, the person shall
obtain a ROW permit and shall abide by all requirements of this
Chapter. The liability, indemnity, insurance and bonding
requirements required herein shall continue in full force and
effect during and after the period of removal and restoration
and until full compliance by the person with the terms and
conditions of the ROW permit and the requirements of this
Chapter.
c. If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been
directed to do so, the City may, to the extent permitted by law,
have the removal done at the person's expense. Alternatively,
the City may permit the abandonment, without removal, of the
facilities if the Director determines that abandonment is not
likely to prevent or significantly impair the future use, repair,
excavation, maintenance, or construction of the ROW.
d. If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been
directed to do so, the City may, to the extent permitted by law,
decide that the ownership of the facilities should be
transferred to the City, or to such person as directed by the
City. In either case the owner of the facilities shall submit a
written instrument, satisfactory in form to the City,
transferring to the City, or to such person as directed by the
City, ownership of the facilities. The City may sell, assign, or
transfer all or part of the facilities so transferred.
e. The City shall not remove or seek to possess or transfer the
facilities until thirty (30) days have passed following written
notice by the Director to the person having facilities within The
ROW of the City's intent to so act. The Director may choose not
to act on good cause shown by the person having facilities
within the ROW.
7. Standards for ROW work.
a. Except for Emergency ROW work as provided in Section
430.030(B)(1)(a), ROW work shall be performed only upon
issuance and in accordance with the requirements of a ROW
permit. At all times during the work, ROW permits shall be
conspicuously displayed at the work site and shall be available
for inspection by the Director.
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.030
AO:1141
b. If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the ROW
work is or will become materially different from that allowed
by the ROW permit, the ROW user shall inform the Director.
The Director may issue a waiver, an extension or a revised
ROW permit, or require that the ROW user reapply for a ROW
permit in accordance with all requirements of this Chapter.
c. ROW users shall not open or encumber more of the rights-ofway
than is reasonably necessary to complete the ROW work in
the most expeditious manner or allow excavations to remain
open longer than is necessary to complete the work.
d. All ROW work that affects vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall
be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected at the
ROW user's expense. The ROW user shall be responsible for
providing adequate traffic control to the area surrounding the
work as determined by the Director.
e. The ROW user shall perform the ROW work at such times that
will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic
and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, as permitted by
the Director. Unless otherwise provided by the Director in the
permit, non-Emergency ROW work on arterial and collector
streets may not be accomplished during the hours of 7:00 A.M.
to 8:30 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. in order to minimize
disruption of traffic flow.
f. The ROW user shall notify the City no less than three (3)
working days in advance of any ROW work that would require
any street closure or would reduce traffic flow to less than two
(2) lanes of moving traffic for more than four (4) hours. Except
in the event of Emergency ROW work, no such closure shall
take place without notice and prior authorization from the City.
g. All ROW work shall be in accordance with all applicable
sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the
National Electrical Safety Code, and other Federal, State, or
local laws and regulations that may apply, including, without
limitation, local health, safety, construction and zoning
ordinances, and laws and accepted industry practices, all as
hereafter may be amended or adopted. In the event of a
conflict among ordinances and standards, the most stringent
ordinance or standard shall apply (except insofar as that
ordinance or standard, if followed, would result in facilities
that could not meet requirements of Federal, State or local
law).
h. All facilities shall be installed and located to cause minimum
interference with the rights and convenience of property
owners, other ROW users and the City. Facilities shall not be
placed where they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1142
or public improvements, or obstruct or hinder in any manner
the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the
City or public improvements.
i. All facilities shall be of good and durable quality.
j. All ROW work shall be conducted in accordance with good
engineering practices, performed by experienced and properly
trained personnel so as not to endanger any person or property
or to unreasonably interfere in any manner with the rights-ofways
or legal rights of any property owner, including the City,
or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular
traffic.
k. All safety practices required by law shall be used during ROW
work, including commonly accepted methods and devices to
prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injury, or nuisance to the public.
l. Any contractor or subcontractor of a ROW user must be
properly licensed under laws of the State and all applicable
local ordinances, and each contractor or subcontractor shall
have the same obligations with respect to its work as a ROW
user would have pursuant to this Chapter. A ROW user:
(1) Must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all
employees performing ROW work are trained and
experienced;
(2) Shall be responsible for ensuring that all work is
performed consistent with the ROW permit and applicable
law;
(3) Shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of
contractors or subcontractors;
(4) Shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or
omissions by any contractor or subcontractor; and
(5) Shall implement a quality control program to ensure that
the work is properly performed.
m. A ROW user shall not place or cause to be placed any sort of
signs, advertisements or other extraneous markings on the
facilities or in the ROW, whether relating to the ROW user or
any other person, except such necessary minimal markings
approved by the City as necessary to identify the facilities for
service, repair, maintenance or emergency purposes or as may
be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or
regulation.

o. Street crossings will be bored at the direction of the Director.
8. Restoring and maintaining the Rights-of-Way.
a. To complete any ROW work, the ROW user shall restore the
ROW and surrounding areas, including but not limited to any
pavement, foundation, concrete slabs or curbs, screening,
landscaping, or vegetation and shall comply with other
reasonable conditions of the Director. Restoration of the ROW
shall be completed within the dates specified in the ROW
permit unless the Director issues a waiver, extension or a new
or revised ROW permit.
b. It shall be the duty of any person making an excavation in the
ROW to backfill such excavations and restore the surface in
accordance with the City's minimum prescribed standards for
such surfaces or the following standards, as determined by the
Director:
(1) If the excavations are made in the improved portion of the
ROW, twelve (12) inches of granular backfill will be placed
over exposed facilities, and controlled low-strength
material (CLSM) will fill the hole within eight (8) inches of
the finished surface for concrete pavements. There will be
a plastic membrane placed between the rock base and the
CLSM to prevent the material from bleeding into the rock
base. The remaining eight (8) inches will be restored by
placing a twenty-eight-day minimum strength, four
thousand five hundred (4,500) psi concrete mix.
(2) If the excavations are made in the improved portion of an
asphalt or combination street, twelve (12) inches of
granular backfill will be placed over exposed facilities, and
CLSM will fill the hole within nine (9) inches of the finished
surface. There will be a plastic membrane placed between
the rock base and the CLSM to prevent the material from
bleeding into the rock base. The remaining nine (9) inches
will be restored by placing a six-inch thick, twenty-eightday
minimum strength, four thousand five hundred (4,500)
psi concrete mix under a three-inch asphalt concrete lift of
Type C mix to meet existing grades.
(3) Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in residential
ROW will be constructed of six (6) inches of compacted
rock base and three (3) inches of type C asphalt concrete
mix. Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in
commercial ROW will be constructed of four (4) inches of
compacted rock base, seven and one-half (7 1/2) inches of
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1144
Type X and three (3) inches of Type C asphalt concrete
mix. Concrete driveway approaches will consist of a fourinch
compacted rock base and be a minimum of six (6)
inches thick in residential ROW and eight (8) inches thick
in commercial ROW.
c. No on-street storage of construction materials is allowable.
d. No Johnny-on-the-spot facilities are allowable on City ROW or
in public view from the ROW.
e. If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the date
specified either by the ROW permit, or any extension thereof as
granted by the Director, the City may perform its own
restoration. The City may also opt to perform its own
restoration regardless of any failure by the ROW user, in which
case the ROW permit, or any amendment or revision thereto,
shall note such option. In either event, if the City performs the
restoration the ROW user shall be responsible for reimbursing
the City's reasonable actual restoration costs within thirty (30)
days of invoice.
f. Every ROW user to whom a ROW permit has been granted shall
guarantee for a period of four (4) years the restoration of the
ROW in the area where the ROW user conducted excavation.
During this period the ROW user shall, upon notification from
the Director, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary as required by the Director. Said work shall be
completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30)
calendar days from receipt of the Director's notice unless
otherwise permitted by the Director. If a ROW user fails to
restore the ROW within the time specified, the City may
perform the work, and the ROW user shall be responsible for
reimbursing the City's reasonable actual restoration costs
within thirty days of invoice. The Director may extend the cure
period on good cause shown.
g. A ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete
the necessary right-of-way restoration and maintenance
because of the existence of any performance bond required by
this Chapter.
9. Any person performing ROW work shall provide written notice to
all property owners within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of the
site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any installation,
replacement or expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of work to be done, the location of
work, and the time and duration of the work.

AO:1145
a. Prior to any ROW work a ROW user shall establish in the City's
favor a performance and maintenance bond in an amount to be
determined by the Director to ensure the restoration of the
rights-of-way. The bond shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of twenty-four (24) months following completion of
the work. The Director shall have the authority to extend the
maintenance bond period for up to an additional twenty-four
(24) months. The Director may waive this requirement when
the work involves no or only minor disruption or damage to the
rights-of-way. The Director shall waive this requirement when
the ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00)
in net assets and does not have a history of non-compliance
with State and local regulations.
b. If a ROW user fails to complete the ROW work in a safe, timely,
and competent manner, or if the completed restorative work
fails without remediation within the time period for the bond
(as determined by the Director), then after notice and a
reasonable opportunity to cure there shall be recoverable,
jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond
any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including
the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost
of removal or abandonment of any property of the ROW user
and the cost of completing work within or restoring the rightsof-
way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to
the full amount of the bond. The City may also recover against
the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund or
letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available
under a security fund or letter of credit.
c. Upon completion of ROW work to the satisfaction of the
Director and upon lapse of the bond period, including any
extension by the Director, the City shall release the bond.
d. The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better
rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/
Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the City's
attorney and shall contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty
(60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the
bond of intent to cancel or not to renew."
e. In lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may
establish in the City's favor such other security as the Director
may determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding
requirements, including but not limited to an annual bond to be
maintained in the minimum amount of twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00).

work and, when applicable, for as long as the ROW user
has facilities within the rights-of-way, at least the following
liability insurance coverage: worker's compensation and
employer liability insurance to meet all requirements of
Missouri law and commercial general liability insurance
with respect to the construction, operation, and

bodily injury or death resulting from any one (1)
accident; and
(c) Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types
of liability.
(2) These insurance requirements shall not be construed to
limit the liability of any person or to impose any liability on
the City or to waive any sovereign immunity.
b. All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do
business in the State of Missouri, with an "A" or better rating of
insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty
Edition, and in a form approved by the City.
c. All insurance policies shall be available for review by the City,
and a ROW user having facilities within the rights-of-way shall
keep on file with the City current certificates of insurance.
d. All general liability insurance policies shall name the City, its
officers, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners,
agents, and employees as additional insureds and shall further
provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not
be effective unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof
has been given to the Director. A ROW user shall not cancel
any required insurance policy without submission of proof that
it has obtained alternative insurance that complies with this
Chapter.
e. The Director may exempt in writing from these insurance
requirements any self-insured ROW user, provided that the
ROW user demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that the
ROW user's self-insurance plan is commensurate with said
requirements and that the ROW user has sufficient resources
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.030
AO:1147
to meet all potential risks, liabilities and obligations
contemplated by the requirements of this Chapter. The
Director may require a security fund or letter of credit as
a condition to a self-insured's exemption. The Director shall
waive this requirement when the ROW user has twenty-five
million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not
have a history of non-compliance with applicable regulatory
law.
3. Indemnification.
a. Any ROW user granted a ROW permit, and any person having
facilities within the rights-of-way, as partial consideration for
the privilege granted, shall, at its sole cost and expense,
indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the City, its officials,
boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents,
and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of
action, proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable
relief arising out of:
(1) Any ROW work, including but not limited to the
construction, maintenance, repair, or replacement of the
facilities;
(2) The operation of its facilities;
(3) Failure to secure consents from landowners; or
(4) Any actions taken or omissions made by the person
pursuant to the authority of this Chapter.
b. The foregoing indemnity provisions include, but are not limited
to, the City's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending
against any such claim, suit, or proceeding prior to the person
assuming such defense. The City shall notify a person of claims
and suits within seven (7) business days of its actual
knowledge of the existence of such claim, suit, or proceeding.
Once a person assumes such defense, the City may at its option
continue to participate in the defense at its own expense.
c. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Chapter, the City shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in
relation to any amounts attributable to:
(1) The City's own negligence, willful misconduct, intentional
or criminal acts; or
(2) The City acting in a proprietary capacity to deliver
service(s) within the City.
d. Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, a
performance bond, or otherwise does not limit a person's duty
to indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery
Section
630.030
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.030
AO:1148
relieve a person of amounts owed to the City, or in any respect
prevent the City from exercising any other right or remedy it
may have.
4. Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this Chapter shall,
upon conviction by the City's municipal court, be punished by a fine
not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment
not to exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and
imprisonment. Each day the violation continues may be charged as
a separate offense.
E. Dispute Resolutions, Appeals And Arbitration.
1. The Director shall make a final determination as to any matter
concerning the grant, denial or revocation of a ROW permit as
provided in this Chapter. On the request of an applicant or a ROW
user and within a reasonable period of time, the Director also shall
make a final determination as to any other issue relating to the use
of the ROW, the imposition of any fee or the application of any
provision of this Chapter; provided, however, that this review shall
not apply to matters being prosecuted in the municipal court. Any
final determination of the Director shall be subject to review as
provided herein.
2. Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the Director may
appeal in writing to the City Manager within five (5) business days
thereof. The appeal shall assert specific grounds for review, and the
City Manager shall render a decision on the appeal within fifteen
(15) business days of receipt affirming, reversing, or modifying the
determination of the Director. The City Manager may extend this
time period for the purpose of any investigation or hearing deemed
necessary. A decision affirming the Director's determination shall
be in writing and supported by findings establishing the
reasonableness of the decision.
3. Any person aggrieved by the final determination of the City
Manager may file a petition for review pursuant to Chapter 536 of

of the County of St. Louis. Such petition shall be filed within thirty
(30) days after the City Manager's final determination.

the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the matter shall be
resolved by a three-person arbitration panel consisting of one
(1) arbitrator selected by the City Manager, one (1) arbitrator
selected by the applicant or ROW user, and one (1) person
selected by the other two (2) arbitrators, in which case each
party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall
jointly and equally bear with the other party the expense of the
third arbitrator and of the arbitration. Each party shall also pay
its own costs, disbursements and attorney fees.
F. Miscellaneous.
1. After the completion of ROW work the ROW user shall provide to
the City as-built drawings, maps or other comparable records as
determined by the Director, drawn to scale and certified to the City
as reasonably depicting the location of all facilities constructed
pursuant to the ROW permit. Such records may be provided to the
Director in the form maintained by the ROW user, but when
available to the ROW user, shall be submitted in automated formats
that are compatible with City systems, as determined by the
Director, or in hard copy otherwise.
2. Upon failure of a ROW user to commence, pursue or complete any
ROW work required by law or by the provisions of this Chapter to
be done in any street, within the time prescribed and to the
reasonable satisfaction of the City, the City may, at its option, after
thirty (30) days' notice, cause such work to be done, and the ROW
user shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts
reported by the City to the ROW user within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such itemized report.
3. Upon ten (10) days' written notice and with the supervision of the
City, or as otherwise provided by law, a ROW user shall have the
authority to trim trees that overhang rights-of-way of the City so as
to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with
its facilities, at its own expense subject to the supervision and
direction of the City. Nothing in this Subsection shall authorize the
trimming of trees on private property without permission of the
property owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed.
4. During ROW work by a ROW user the City shall have the right to
install, and to thereafter maintain, at its own cost in any excavation
to or other applicable disturbance of the ROW any parallel facilities
of its own that do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
other facilities.
5. Nothing in this Chapter shall be in preference or hindrance to the
right of the City and any board, authority, commission or public

using facilities located within the City.
B. Facilities permits.
1. Any person desiring to place aboveground facilities on private
property must first apply for and obtain a facilities permit, in
addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise,
or authorization required by law. The Director may design and
make available standard forms for such applications, requiring
such information as allowed by law and as the Director determines
in his or her discretion to be necessary and consistent with the
provisions of this Chapter and to accomplish the purposes of this
Chapter. Each application shall at minimum contain the following
information, unless otherwise waived by the Director:
Section
630.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.040
AO:1151
a. The name of the person on whose behalf the facilities are to be
installed and the name, address, and telephone number of a
representative whom the City may notify or contact at any time
[i.e., twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week]
concerning the facilities;
b. A description of the proposed work, including a site plan and
such plans or technical drawings or depictions showing the
nature, dimensions, and description of the facilities, their
location, and their proximity to other facilities that may be
affected by their installation.
2. Each such application shall be accompanied by an application fee
approved by the City to cover the cost of processing the
application.
3. Application review and determination.
a. The Director shall promptly review each application and shall
grant or deny the application within thirty-one (31) days.
Unless the application is denied pursuant to Subsection

full compliance with this Chapter and all other City ordinances.
The Director may establish procedures for bulk processing of

processing and accounting costs.
b. It is the intention of the City that proposed facilities will not
impair public safety, harm property values or significant sight
lines, or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining properties or
neighborhood, and that the placement and appearance of
facilities on private property should be minimized and limited
in scope to the extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of
this Section. To accomplish such purposes the Director may
impose conditions on facilities permits, including alternative
landscaping, designs, or locations, provided that such
conditions are reasonable and necessary, shall not result in a

conditions required by the Director; and
(6) For any other reason to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, provided that such denial does not fall within
the exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service
Commission and is imposed on a competitively neutral and
non-discriminatory basis.
4. Permit revocation and ordinance violations.
a. The Director may revoke a facilities permit without fee refund
after notice and an opportunity to cure, but only in the event of
a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the permit
or this Chapter. Prior to revocation the Director shall provide
written notice to the responsible person identifying any
substantial breach and allowing a reasonable period of time
not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which
cure period may be immediate if certain activities must be
stopped to protect the public safety. The cure period shall be
extended by the Director on good cause shown. A substantial
breach includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(1) A material violation of the facilities permit or this Chapter;
(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of
the permit or this Chapter, or the perpetration or attempt

opportunity to cure as specified by the Director, work that
does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances,
industry construction standards, or the City's pertinent
and applicable ordinances, including but not limited to this
Section
630.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.040
AO:1153
Chapter, provided that City standards are no more
stringent than those of a national safety ordinance.
b. Any breach of the terms and conditions of a facilities permit
shall also be deemed a violation of this Chapter, and in lieu of
revocation the Director may initiate prosecution of the
applicant or the facilities Owner for such violation.
5. Appeals and alternative dispute resolution.
a. Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the Director
may appeal in writing to the City Manager within five business
(5) days thereof. The appeal shall assert specific grounds for
review, and the City Manager shall render a decision on the
appeal within fifteen (15) business days of its receipt affirming,
reversing or modifying the determination of the Director. The
City Manager may extend this time period for the purpose of
any investigation or hearing deemed necessary. A decision
affirming the Director's determination shall be in writing and
supported by findings establishing the reasonableness of the
decision. Any person aggrieved by the final determination of
the City Manager may file a petition for review pursuant to
Chapter 536 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, as amended,

attorney fees.
(2) In the event of arbitration, the City Manager and the
applicant shall agree to a single arbitrator. The costs and
fees of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties.
If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the matter
shall be resolved by a three-person arbitration panel
consisting of one (1) arbitrator selected by the City
Manager, one (1) arbitrator selected by the applicant or
facilities Owner, and one (1) person selected by the other
two (2) arbitrators, in which case each party shall bear the
expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally
bear with the other party the expense of the third
arbitrator and of the arbitration. Each party shall also pay
its own costs, disbursements and attorney fees.
C. Facilities Regulations.
Section
630.040
RICHMOND HEIGHTS CITY CODE Section
630.040
AO:1154
1. The following general regulations apply to the placement and
appearance of facilities:
a. Facilities shall be placed underground, except when other
similar facilities exist aboveground or when conditions are
such that underground construction is impossible, impractical
or economically unfeasible, as determined by the City, and
when in the City's judgment the aboveground construction has
minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is
proposed. Facilities shall not be located so as to interfere, or be
likely to interfere, with any public facilities or use of public
property.
b. Location.
(1) Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or
eliminate their visibility. Non-residential zoning districts
are preferred to residential zoning districts. Preferred
locations in order of priority in both type districts are:
(a) Thoroughfare landscape easements;
(b) Rear yards; and
(c) Street side yards on a corner lot behind the front yard
setback.
(2) Placements within side yards not bordered by a street or
within front yards are discouraged.
c. Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright,
reflective, or metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be considered
neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the
facilities. Sight-proof screening, landscape or otherwise, may
be required for facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or
covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such
screening shall be sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility.
A landscape plan identifying the size and species of
landscaping materials shall be approved by the Director prior
to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening.
The person responsible for the facilities shall be responsible
for the installation, repair, or replacement of screening
materials. Alternative concealment may be approved by the
Director to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these
requirements.
d. Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner
and so as to not emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and in
accordance with all applicable provisions of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety
Section
630.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
630.040
AO:1155
Code, and all other applicable Federal, State, or local laws and
regulations.
e. No person shall place or cause to be placed any sort of signs,
advertisements, or other extraneous markings on the facilities,
except such necessary minimal markings approved by the City
as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair,
maintenance or emergency purposes or as may be otherwise
required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation.
f. If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for
facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts with the
reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director shall
cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find
suitable alternatives, but the City shall not be required to incur
any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the applicant.
2. Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing, or
