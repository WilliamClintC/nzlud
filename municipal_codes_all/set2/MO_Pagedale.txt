this Chapter shall be announced publicly at an open meeting of the governmental body and
entered into the minutes.
Any meeting or vote closed pursuant to Section 120.020 shall be closed only to the extent
necessary for the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote. Public
governmental bodies shall not discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or vote which
does not directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote.
Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting shall close only an existing portion of the
meeting facility necessary to house the members of the public governmental body in the closed
session, allowing members of the public to remain to attend any subsequent open session held by
the public governmental body following the closed session.

be regarded as if all members were physically present and in attendance at the meeting.
A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and retained by the public
governmental body including, but not limited to, a record of any vote taken at such meeting. The
minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent, and a record of

disabled individuals.
When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or at a place
that is not reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the
public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall
be stated in the minutes.
Section 120.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
Section 120.090. Custodian Designated — Response to Request
for Access to Records.
The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible for maintenance and
control of all records. The custodian may designate deputy custodians in operating departments of

custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and meetings in accord with the
policies enumerated herein.

industry regulators having similar authority.

event later than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the request is received

Section 120.100. Violations — Remedies, Procedure, Penalty —
Validity of Actions by Governing Bodies in Violation —
Governmental Bodies May Seek Interpretation of Law.
The remedies provided by this Section against public governmental bodies shall be in addition to
those provided by any other provision of law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to or citizen of this
State may seek judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the
County in which the public governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of
a summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil action brought to enforce the
provisions of Sections 610.010 to 610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the
subject matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or otherwise dispose of
the public record sought to be inspected and examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an
exemption pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record is not a
public record until the court directs otherwise.
Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., demonstrates
to the court that the body in question is subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., and has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion shall be
on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds that there is a knowing violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all costs
and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing a violation. The court shall
determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds that there was a purposeful violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing such a violation. The
court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction,
the seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body has violated
any provision of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in

violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts of the particular
case that the public interest in the enforcement of the policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., outweighs the public interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed
meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within one (1) year from which the
violation is ascertainable and in no event shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the
violation. This Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of bonds or
other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body if a public hearing, election or
public sale has been held regarding the bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of closing a particular meeting,
record or vote may bring suit at the expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court
of the County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to ascertain the
propriety of any such action or seek a formal opinion of the Attorney General or an attorney for the
governmental body.
Section 120.110. Fees for Copying Public Records — Limitations.
Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body shall provide access to and,
upon request, furnish copies of public records subject to the following:
Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,
RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the average hourly
rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time required for
fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the
scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies using employees
of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the records
may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14) inches shall
include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of
pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and programming, if
necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for the duplication. Fees for
maps, blueprints or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual
rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps, blueprints or
plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the actual cost of such
programming.
Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of copies.

given a certificate explicitly stating the conditions on which he/she is being released.
In addition to such other authority as exists to order conditions of probation, the Court may order
conditions which the Court believes will serve to compensate the victim of the crime, any
dependent of the victim, or society in general. Such conditions may include, but need not be
limited to:

Judge; and

render judgment accordingly. Any County, City, person, organization or agency or employee of a
County, City, organization or agency charged with the supervision of such free work or who
benefits from its performance shall be immune from any suit by the person placed on parole or
probation or any person deriving a cause of action from him/her if such cause of action arises from
such supervision of performance, except for intentional torts or gross negligence. The services

best interests due to limited competition or other valid reason.
The following contributions shall count toward the project goal: portions of work undertaken as
contractors, joint ventures, subcontractors, and suppliers.
As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
BUSINESS or BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
A sole proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership,
limited liability limited partnership, joint-stock company, joint venture, professional association,
or any other legal entity operated for profit that is properly licensed or registered, as
applicable, owned and controlled by persons who are citizens or lawful permanent residents
of the United States, and otherwise authorized to do business in the State of Missouri.
CERTIFIED MBE OR WBE

business enterprise by either:
The City of St. Louis, Missouri, including Lambert-St. Louis International Airport; or
The State of Missouri or its certifying agencies, including the Office of Equal Opportunity;
or
The St. Louis Minority Business Council.
COMMERCIALLY USEFUL FUNCTION
A real and actual service that is a distinct and verifiable element of the construction services
based upon private sector trade or industry standards. An MBE or WBE performs a
commercially useful function when it is responsible for executing the ordinary and necessary
work of the construction services and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing,
managing, and supervising the work involved. Factors considered in determining whether the
construction services constitute a commercially useful function include but are not limited to
the amount of construction services subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount
the MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the construction
services it is actually performing, whether the MBE or WBE has the skill and expertise to
perform the construction services for which it is being utilized, whether the MBE or WBE is
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price,
determining quality and quantity, ordering, installing (where applicable), and paying for the
material and supplies itself, and credit claimed for its performance of the construction
services.

with requirements, terms, or conditions imposed by those governments, or to highway
projects as to which Disadvantaged Business Enterprise goals are applicable.

perform construction services on a City contract.

SUPPLIER
A business enterprise that directly contracts with a contractor or subcontractor to provide
materials, supplies, or equipment for a City contract and is a regular dealer, manufacturer,
manufacturer's representative, or broker.
The bid or proposal specifications for each construction project shall require that all bidders or
proposers seeking to contract with the City address the project goals either by committing to
compliance in ability therewith or by demonstrating to do so despite specific and identified good
faith efforts. Good faith efforts must be demonstrated to be meaningful and not merely formalistic.
The scope and intensity of the efforts will be considered in determining whether the bidder or
proposer has achieved a good faith effort.
If the bidder or proposer is an MBE or WBE, the value of the commercially useful function to be
self-performed by the MBE or WBE shall count toward satisfaction of the project goal. The bidder
or proposer shall count toward satisfaction of the project goal only that portion of each MBE or
WBE subcontractor's work which is self-performed by that subcontractor.
The City Clerk shall review all bids or proposals for compliance with the requirements of this
Section. If the City Clerk determines that a bid or proposal meets the project goals or has shown
adequate good faith efforts to achieve the goals, then the bid or proposal shall be deemed
responsive as to the requirements of this Section. If the City Clerk determines that a bid or
proposal does not meet the project goals and that the bidder or proposer has failed to show good
faith efforts to achieve the goals, then the City Clerk shall designate the bid or proposal as
nonresponsive with the concurrence of the City Attorney and no further consideration shall be
given to it. A full and complete statement of the reasons for designating the bid or proposal as
nonresponsive shall be filed with the other contract documents.
Any change orders that result in a net increase in compensation to the contractor shall be
performed in compliance with the goals set forth in Subsection (A), unless the City Clerk
determines that the contractor has shown adequate good faith efforts to achieve the goals in
accordance with the procedure set forth in Subsection (F).
The City Clerk shall receive and investigate complaints concerning compliance with the
requirements set forth herein and may further initiate his or her own investigations concerning
compliance, either during the project or after completion. Business enterprises being investigated
shall cooperate fully with the investigation and shall have a continuing burden of providing
complete, truthful information to the City Clerk's designee.
If a contractor is found to be in violation of the provisions of this Section or any representations in
the contractor's bid or proposal, the City may suspend or terminate the contract and will reserve all
of its rights at law or equity or pursue any available remedies against the contractor. Failure to
meet the goal or to demonstrate good faith efforts to meet the goal may subject the contractor to
liquidated damages and will be considered in determining the qualifications of the contractor as to
future bids and/or proposals.
Article V. Levy of Taxes
Section 130.060. Board to Provide for Levy and Collection of

Procedure.
The Board of Alderpersons shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on the proposed rates of taxes at

time and place for such hearing. A notice stating the hour, date and place of the hearing shall be
published in at least one (1) newspaper qualified under the laws of the State of Missouri of general
circulation in the County within which all or the largest portion of the City is situated, or such notice
shall be posted in at least three (3) public places within the City; except that, in any County of the First
Class having a Charter form of government, such notice may be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City even though such newspaper is not qualified under the laws of Missouri for
other legal notices. Such notice shall be published or posted at least seven (7) days prior to the date of
the hearing. The notice shall include the assessed valuation by category of real, personal and other
tangible property in the City for the fiscal year for which the tax is to be levied as provided by
Subsection (3) of Section 137.245, RSMo., the assessed valuation by category of real, personal and
other tangible property in the City for the preceding taxable year, for each rate to be levied the amount
of revenue required to be provided from the property tax as set forth in the annual budget adopted as
provided by Chapter 67, RSMo., and the tax rates proposed to be set for the various purposes of
taxation. The tax rates shall be calculated to produce substantially the same revenues as required in
the annual budget adopted as provided in this Chapter. Following the hearing the Board of
Alderpersons shall fix the rates of taxes, the same to be entered in the tax book. Failure of any
taxpayer to appear at such hearing shall not prevent the taxpayer from pursuit of any other legal
remedy otherwise available to the taxpayer. Nothing in this Section absolves the City of responsibilities
under Section 137.073, RSMo., nor to adjust tax rates in event changes in assessed valuation occur
that would alter the tax rate calculations.
Section 130.080. Board to Fix Rate of Levy.
The Board of Alderpersons shall, within a reasonable time after the Assessor's books of each year are
returned, ascertain the amount of money to be raised thereon for general and other purposes and fix

of all property within the corporate limits of the City made taxable by law for State purposes and the
assessed valuation thereof as agreed upon by the Board of Equalization, which abstract shall be
immediately transmitted to the Board of Alderpersons, and it shall be the duty of the Board of
Alderpersons to establish by ordinance the rate of taxes for the year.

Section 315.060. Traffic Control Signal Legend — Right Turn on
Red Light — When.
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored
lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and
yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and

Transportation Commission with reference to an intersection involving a State highway,
and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under
their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection
where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
Section 315.070. Pedestrian Control Signals.
Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or "Don't Walk" or
appropriate symbols are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:
"WALK": Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of
the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
"WAIT" or "DON'T WALK": No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of
such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his/her crossing on the walk
signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.
Section 315.080. Flashing Signals.
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a
limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with
caution.
This Section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles
approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in Section
335.090 of this Title.

traffic control signal for an intersection is emitting a steady red signal for the direction of travel or
orientation of a motor vehicle in or through the intersection, the motor vehicle present in the
intersection and the license plate and license number of the motor vehicle. Recorded images may
also be used as evidence of other violations to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Enforcement Procedures.
Except as otherwise provided herein, upon review of recorded image(s) showing an infraction
under this Section, a Police Officer of the City Police Department shall complete a citation in a
form approved by the Municipal Judge (which form may be completed electronically or online)
and the City shall cause the completed citation to be mailed to the owner at its last known

one (1) of the justifications for presence of the motor vehicle in the intersection set forth
in this Section 315.085.
A copy of the recorded image(s) upon which the citation is based shall be sent to the
owner with the citation.
The citation shall include a request that the name, address and operator's license
number of any person renting or leasing the motor vehicle at the time the violation
occurred be furnished to the City within ten (10) days of receipt of the request.
Any sworn statement provided by an owner shall be examined by the City Prosecuting
Attorney. If the City Prosecuting Attorney determines that a statement is sufficient, then the
citation shall be withdrawn and a letter to that effect shall be sent to the owner by the City. If
the City Prosecuting Attorney determines that a statement is insufficient, including but not
limited to, a determination based upon a comparison of the statement to the recorded
image(s), then a letter shall be sent to the owner (any or all of them) at its last known address
by first class U.S. Mail, postage prepaid by the City indicating that the statement was
insufficient and the fine specified in this Section 315.085 must be paid at the appropriate time
and place in the City within ten (10) days of the date of the letter. If the statement timely
provides the name, address and operator's license number of any person renting or leasing
the motor vehicle at the time the violation occurred, then the citation shall be withdrawn, a
letter to that effect shall be sent to the owner by the City and a new citation shall be issued to
the identified person together with a copy of the identifying statement, which person shall be
liable hereunder as if an owner.
In lieu of completing a citation, the Police Department may send a warning notice to the
owner if the system location was established within one (1) week of the violation or if the
reviewing officer determines that the recorded images are inconclusive or that it is more likely
than not that a justification applies to the violation.
Fine. Notwithstanding any other provision of the City Code of Ordinances, the fine for the
infraction of violation of public safety at an intersection shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) and
under no circumstances may a person be imprisoned for such an infraction.
Warning Signs. An Automated Photo Traffic Enforcement System may be identified by advance
warning signs posted at entrances to the City and/or at specific system locations, if the Police
Chief determines that such signs will enhance the efficacy of the system. Absence of such signs
shall not provide justification for a violation.
Failure To Respond To Citation. Any person who shall fail to respond to a citation or letter issued
under this Section 315.085 by timely payment of fine or by timely and sufficient statement as
described herein or who shall submit a false sworn statement hereunder shall be subject to
prosecution for failure to respond to citation in the Municipal Court for violation of this Section
subject to the general penalty provisions of Section 100.220, in addition to any other applicable
liabilities or sanctions.

Section 340.180. Hand and Mechanical Signals.
No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle from a direct course or
move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable
safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided
further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so
constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such
vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this State
after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.
Section 340.190. Stopping for School Bus.

shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
Section 340.200. Right-of-Way at Intersection — Signs at
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.

When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The State Highways and Transportation Commission or local authorities with respect to roads
under their respective jurisdictions, on any Section where construction or major maintenance
operations are being effected, may fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs,
and the operation of a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be
deemed prima facie evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section
320.060.

prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the
roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.

operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon the streets
or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained

For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in

person in any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in

identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.

liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid

Chapter 415. Floodplain Management
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact;
Purposes.
[Ord. No. 1541[1] Art 1, 9-29-2014]
Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo. 79.110 delegated
the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Alderpersons
of the City of Pagedale, Missouri ordains as follows.
Findings of Fact.
Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Pagedale, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,

A.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of
a series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which
could be expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as
delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for St.
Louis County, dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights
more than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted
that would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but
still subject to inundation by the base flood.
Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 415.010(B)(1); to establish or
maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding
or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
Editor's Note: This ordinance also superseded former Ch. 415, Flood Hazard Prevention, adopted and
amended by CC 2000 §§415.010 — 415.090; and 6-19-1995 by Arts. 1 — 9 of Ord. No. 1057.

apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Section 415.040(D)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 415.040.

Section 415.050. Floodplain Management Variance Procedures.
[Ord. No. 1541 Art. 5, 9-29-2014]
Establishment Of Appeal Board. The Board of Adjustment as established by the City of Pagedale
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management
requirements of this Chapter.
Responsibility Of Appeal Board.
Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations is denied by the City Clerk, the applicant may apply for
such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment, as
defined in Section 415.050(A).
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the City Clerk in the
enforcement or administration of this Chapter.

Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the following criteria:
The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems; streets; and bridges.
Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of
Subsection (E)(2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or
local inventory of historic places upon determination provided that the proposed activity will
not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Chapter.
Conditions For Approving Variances For Accessory Structures.
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a
case-by-case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet
the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Section
415.050(D) and (E) of this Chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for
accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes
in Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior
building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior
finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant
materials in accordance with Section 415.040(A)(4)(b) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Section 415.040(A)(4)(a) of this
Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific
flood-related forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris
impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base
flood elevation or floodproofed so that it is contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Section 415.040(A)(4)(d) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls subject to
the one-hundred-year flood contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with Section 415.040(B)(1)(c) of this Chapter.

Section 420.070. Variance Procedures.
[Ord. No. 1394 §5.2, 2-25-2008]
Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the
following provisions:
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this Chapter and its shape,
topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this
Chapter, and the City of Pagedale official finds and determines that the requirements of this
Chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Appeals Board of
the City of Pagedale may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements
hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any
proposed land development on the parcel.
Except as provided above, the Appeals Board of the City of Pagedale shall grant no variance
from any provision of this Chapter without first conducting a public hearing on the application
for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Appeals
Board. The City of Pagedale shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City of Pagedale. The City of Pagedale shall
require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public
hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be
clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of
the adoption of this Chapter prevents land development unless a buffer variance is
granted.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the
Chapter would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this Chapter, actions of any
property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and
other natural features as determined by field survey;
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical
characteristics of the property;
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and
other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both
inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected
shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
At least one (1) alternative plan which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or
an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and

Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request
must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of
the property;
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the
environment.

Requirements.
[Ord. No. 1394 §6, 2-25-2008]
This Chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation,

[Ord. No. 1394 §8, 2-25-2008]
Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof nor with the
provisions of this Chapter shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for

liability upon the City of Pagedale, its officers or employees for injury or damage to persons or
property.

demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the City and
such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is
located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360,

insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section, at
the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than

personal debt against the property owner(s) until paid.
This Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and
structures.
This Section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable
to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance
policy.
The Building Commissioner may certify that in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim
payment under Subsection (A) that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed
or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In
this event, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt of
proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without the deduction pursuant to
Subsection (A) of this Section. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other person making the
claim to provide the insurance company with the written certificate provided for in this Subsection.

connected networks in a manner consistent with, and supportive of, the surrounding community.
The City of Pagedale will strive to incorporate complete streets principles into all public strategic

incorporation of one (1) or more complete streets elements into the public transportation project.

in a safe manner, the degree that such improvements or facilities may be utilized, the benefit of
such improvements or facilities to other public transportation improvements, whether additional
property is required, physical or area requirements or limitations and any other factors deemed
relevant.

It shall be the duty of every manufacturer engaged in manufacturing within the City as aforesaid at
the effective date of this Code and of every manufacturer thereafter commencing manufacturing
within the City to make application to the Collector of the City, after commencement of business,
for a license hereunder on forms furnished by the Collector, such license to be for the balance of
the license year current at such effective date.
Thereafter, before the first (1st) day of July in each year, the Collector and his/her deputies shall
require each and every manufacturer theretofore licensed to renew such license for the
forthcoming year, delivering to each such manufacturer the forms for renewal and return as
hereinafter provided, which renewal application shall be filed on or before the first (1st) day of July

renewal license for the then current license year, each manufacturer shall, in addition to the
estimate required for the then current license year, make an adjusted return for the preceding
license year or fraction thereof showing the actual value of goods manufactured hereinabove
defined, made during such preceding license year or fraction thereof, the tax due thereon and the
amount of tax previously paid and if said adjusted return shall show that he/she shall have
overpaid his/her tax, he/she shall be entitled to a refund or to a credit on his/her tax for the then
current license year; but if such return shall show that he/she shall have under paid his/her tax,
he/she shall pay the additional tax due forthwith, it being the intent and purpose of this Article that
each such manufacturer shall pay a license tax for each license year or portion thereof that this
Chapter is in effect or he/she is in business, measured by actual value of goods manufactured as
hereinabove defined, made by said manufacturer during said license year or portion thereof.
Each such statement or return, with computation of the tax due thereon as hereinafter provided in
Section 605.210, shall be made in writing and delivered to the Collector, verified by affidavit of the
manufacturer or an officer or agent of the manufacturer thereunto duly authorized and said return

this Section regarding the placement of accessory utility facilities on public or private property. For
purposes of this Section, "accessory utility facilities" shall mean such facilities, including pedestals,
boxes, vaults, cabinets, or other ground-mounted or below ground facilities that directly serve the
property or local area in which the facility is placed, are not primarily for transmission or
distribution to other locations, do not materially alter the character of the neighborhood or area,
and otherwise are customarily found in such areas.
Except where limited by other provisions of City ordinance, accessory utility facilities shall be
subject to the following supplementary regulations:
Approval — design — location — application. The design, location and nature of all accessory
utility facilities on private or public property shall require approval of the City, which approval
shall be considered in a non-discriminatory manner, in conformance with this Chapter, and
subject to reasonable permit conditions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this
Chapter. In considering applications for individual or multiple location applications, the City
shall review the request to ensure the proposed facilities do not impair public safety, harm
property values or significant sight lines, or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining properties
or neighborhood, and taking into consideration reasonable alternatives. Any material changes
or extensions to such facilities or the construction of any additional structures shall be subject
to the requirements and approvals as set forth herein. Unless otherwise prohibited, utility
facilities subject to this Subsection may be located in minimum setback areas provided that all
other requirements are met. To the extent permitted by Section 67.2707.3, RSMo., the time,
method, manner or location of facilities to be located in the rights-of-way may be established
or conditioned by the City to protect the rights-of-way or to ensure public safety. An inspection

of non-use and shall therefore be removed within thirty (30) days thereafter at the cost of
the utility.
Unless otherwise restricted, utility poles for authorized above ground lines or facilities
shall be permitted up to forty-five (45) feet in height where utilities are not otherwise
required to be placed underground; provided that such poles shall be no higher than
necessary, maintained so as to avoid leaning from upright position, and without use of
guy wires crossing rights-of-way or pedestrian routes except where approved by the City
as necessary due to the lack of feasible alternatives.
Utility facilities placed in designated historic areas may be subject to additional
requirements regarding the placement and appearance of facilities as may be necessary
to reasonably avoid or reduce any negative impact of such placement.
Any damage to landscaping or vegetation on private or public property during installation
or maintenance of facilities shall be promptly remedied by the facility owner.

commercial gain to be used in mailing lists or for other commercial purposes not
reasonably related to the conduct of the business of the video service provider or its
affiliates as required under 47 U.S.C. § 551, including all notice requirements. Video
service providers shall provide an address and telephone number for a local subscriber
to use without toll charge to prevent disclosure of the subscriber's name or address.
As required by Section 67.2692, RSMo., this Article II, Section 635.320 et seq. shall be
enforced only as follows:
Each video service provider shall implement an informal process for handling inquiries
from the City and customers concerning billing issues, service issues and other
complaints. If an issue is not resolved through this informal process, the City may request
a confidential non-binding mediation with the video service provider, with the costs of
such mediation to be shared equally between the City and the video service provider.
In this case of repeated, willful and material violations of the provisions of this Section by
a video service provider, the City may file a complaint on behalf of a resident harmed by
such violations with Missouri's Administrative Hearing Commission seeking an order
revoking the video service provider's Public Service Commission authorization. The City
or a video service provider may appeal any determination made by the Administrative
Hearing Commission under this Section to a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall
have the power to review the decision de novo. The City shall not file a complaint seeking
revocation unless the service provider has been given sixty (60) days' notice to cure
alleged breaches but has failed to do so.
Public, Educational And Government Access Programming.
Each video service provider shall designate the same number of channels for non-commercial
public, educational or governmental (PEG) use as designated by the incumbent cable
operator.
Any PEG channel that is not substantially utilized by the City may be reclaimed and
programmed by the video service provider at the provider's discretion. If the City finds and
certifies that a channel that has been reclaimed by a video service provider will be
substantially utilized, the video provider shall restore the reclaimed channel within one
hundred twenty (120) days. A PEG channel shall be considered substantially utilized when
forty (40) hours per week are locally programmed on that channel for at least three (3)

consecutive months. In determining whether a PEG channel is substantially utilized, a
program may be counted not more than four (4) times during a calendar week.
The operation of any PEG access channel and the production of any programming that
appears on each such channel shall be the sole responsibility of the City or its duly
appointment agent receiving the benefit of such channel, and the video service provider shall
bear only the responsibility for the transmission of the programming on each such channel to
subscribers. The City must deliver and submit to the video service provider all transmissions
of PEG content and programming in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and
transmitted by such video service provider holder over its network without further alteration or
change in the content or transmission signal. Such content and programming must be
compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the video service provider to deliver its
video services. The video service provider shall cooperate with the City to allow the City to
achieve such compatibility.
The City shall make the programming of any PEG access channel available to all video
service providers in a non-discriminatory manner. Each video service provider shall be
responsible for providing the connectivity to the City's or its duly appointed agent's PEG
access channel distribution points existing as of August 27, 2007. Where technically
necessary and feasible, video service providers shall use reasonable efforts and shall
negotiate in good faith to interconnect their video service networks on mutually acceptable
rates, terms and conditions for the purpose of transmitting PEG programming. A video service
provider shall have no obligation to provide such interconnection to a new video service
provider at more than one (1) point per headend, regardless of the number of political
subdivisions served by such headend. The video service provider requesting interconnection
shall be responsible for any costs associated with such interconnection, including signal
transmission from the origination point to the point of interconnection. Interconnection may be
accomplished by direct cable microwave link, satellite or other reasonable method of
connection acceptable to the person providing the interconnect.
The franchise obligation of an incumbent cable operator to provide monetary and other
support for PEG access facilities existing on August 27, 2007, shall continue until the date of
franchise expiration (ignoring any early termination by virtue of issuance of a video service
authorization) or January 1, 2012, whichever is earlier. Any other video service provider shall
have the same obligation to support PEG access facilities as the incumbent cable operator,
but if there is more than one (1) incumbent, then the incumbent with the most subscribers as
of August 27, 2007. Such obligation shall be prorated, depending on the nature of the
obligation, as provided in Section 67.2703 RSMo. The City shall notify each video service
provider of the amount of such fee on an annual basis, beginning one (1) year after issuance
of the video service authorization.
A video service provider may identify and pass through as a separate line item on
subscribers' bills the value of monetary and other PEG access support on a proportionate
basis.
Compliance With Other Regulations. All video service providers shall comply with all other
applicable laws and regulations.
This Section shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and it is recorded.
