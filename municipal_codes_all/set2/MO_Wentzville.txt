PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wentzville, Missouri. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2008 Code, as supplemented through April 27, 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2008 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The title, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a decimal. The figure before the decimal refers to the chapter number; the figure after the decimal refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 305 is numbered 305.020. Under this system, each section is identified with its location, and at the same time, new sections can be inserted in their proper places by using the decimal system for amendments. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Howard George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

(2)  Interruptions. A member of the board of aldermen, once recognized, shall not be interrupted when speaking, unless it is to call the member to order or as otherwise provided in this section. If a member while speaking is called to order, the member shall cease speaking until the question of order is determined and, if in order, the member shall be permitted to proceed.

The motion shall be debatable. A previously considered motion may become a substantially different question through a significant change in the wording or because of a difference in the time or circumstances in which it is proposed, and such a motion may thus be in order when it could not otherwise be renewed. Matters that are presented again to the board of aldermen more than six months after the board's initial rejection of such matter, unless the facts suggest otherwise, are new matters and thus not restricted by the limitations on reconsideration or renewal of motions. 
(4)  Remarks of aldermen entered in minutes.

CHAPTER 125. - ETHICS 

Sec. 125.010. - Purpose and applicability; declaration of policy. 
(a)  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there has been established by the board of aldermen a code of ethics for all officials and employees of the city, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this chapter and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interests of the city. This policy shall apply to the mayor, board of aldermen, paid employees, members of all boards and commissions, and volunteers for the city.

Sec. 125.020. - Responsibilities of public office. 
    Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the state and federal constitutions and to carry out impartially federal, state, county and city law and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above reproach. 
(Code 2008, § 125.020; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015)

    Entity means any individual, sole proprietorship, corporation, company, business endeavor, partnership, association, or any other organization whatsoever, whether for profit or not-for-profit. 
    Special monetary benefit means being materially affected in a substantially different manner or degree than the manner or degree in which the public in general will be affected or, if the matter affects only a special class of persons, then affected in a substantially different manner or degree than the manner or degree in which such class will be affected. In all such matters, such officials must recuse themselves from acting, except that such official may act on increases in compensation subject to the restrictions of section 13 of article VII of the state constitution. 
    Substantial interest means ownership by the individual, his spouse or his dependent children, whether singularly or collectively, directly or indirectly, of: 
(1)  Ten percent or more of any entity involved; 
(2)  An interest having a value of $10,000.00 or more in the matter in any entity involved; or 
(3)  The receipt of a salary, gratuity or other compensation or remuneration of $5,000.00 or more per year from any entity involved in the matter. 
(Code 2008, § 125.030; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.040. - Orientation training. 
(a)  A person shall receive orientation training on ethics within a reasonable length of time after election as either a member of the board of aldermen or to the office of mayor or appointment to a city board, commission or committee and after taking office. It shall be the responsibility of the city administrator to provide this training, which shall include: legislative procedures, applicable sections of RSMo chs. 105 , 130 , 610 , 150 and 155 . Such training will also be provided every three years thereafter.

Elected and appointed officials will have the opportunity to meet with each department head, receive orientation on that department's functions and responsibilities, and to meet with the city administrator and receive orientation on any compensation and benefits. 
(c)  Appointed department heads and all other city employees will receive training regarding the ethics, anti-fraud and corruption, and political activity provisions of this Code from the human resources department during new hire orientation and every three years thereafter.

(b)  Any member of any board, commission or committee of the city who has a substantial interest in any measure, bill, order or ordinance proposed or pending before the board, commission or committee must disclose that interest to the city clerk, and such disclosure shall be recorded in the board, commission or committee minutes. 
(c)  Elected and appointed officials should avoid the appearance of impropriety by refraining from engaging in conduct that makes their decisions appear to have been unduly influenced by others rather than being arrived at independently. All employees, elected and appointed officials should avoid the appearance of impropriety. Decisions should be arrived at independently from undue influence and pressure based on personal relationships and affiliations. Other situations may not be covered by these guidelines. In these situations, members of the board of aldermen, employees and members of all city boards and commissions are encouraged to seek counsel from the city administrator prior to acting. Again, the appearance of fairness and impartiality is as important as actual fairness and impartiality. When a conflict of interest or potential appearance of impropriety does occur, the following steps should be taken: 
(1)  The member or official must declare and the record should show that a conflict of interest exists or potential appearance of impropriety exists with respect to a particular issue and that the member will not participate in any discussion or action; 
(2)  The member or official shall explain and the record should show what constitutes the specific conflict or potential appearance of impropriety; 
(3)  The member or official may be asked to step down from his regular seat and leave the room; 
(4)  The member or official should not speak with any other members during or prior to the discussion of the issue at hand;

(6)  The member or official must not discuss the issue privately with any other member voting on the matter.

Donors that are involved in a matter under current review with a pending outcome with any city process such as any zoning or development matter, building inspection, public-private partnership for financing public infrastructure or projects, police investigation, building/property maintenance code investigation, or any investigation into the violation of this Code. 
2.  Contractors, vendors, or persons seeking to provide services/materials to the city. 
b.  Are there restrictions upon the use of the item or funds that make it impractical or inappropriate to accept? 
c.  Are there restrictions on disposal or retention of the item or funds that make it impractical or inappropriate to accept? 
d.  Is any required accounting for the item or funds excessively difficult? 
e.  Would donated materials or equipment require extensive or costly repair or maintenance, and, if so, is maintenance support available? 
f.  Does the equipment or materials require the purchase of additional items to be useful? 
g.  What effect will the donation have on the city's budget? Donations are to be considered one-time supplements and should not be used to develop new programs or services which would require budget supplements from the city in the current or subsequent years, unless a benefit analysis proves the donation to be fiscally responsible, cost effective and receives approval as outlined in this policy. 
(b)  Solicitations. 
(1)  Solicitation of donations to the city shall be subject to this section as well as the procedures applicable to acceptance of an unsolicited donation under section 125.080. Approval of a solicitation shall constitute approval of acceptance, unless the terms and conditions required for acceptance are materially different from those included with the solicitation. 
(2)  Except as otherwise permitted under section 125.080(d)(3), individual employees shall obtain approval prior to soliciting donations to the city. If the total amount of the solicitation sought is for a donation of $5,000.00 or less, approval shall be obtained from the city administrator. If the solicitation is for a donation of over $5,000.00, approval shall be obtained from the board of aldermen. Elected and appointed city officials shall not solicit donations to the city. 
(3)  Other than a donation solicitation approved pursuant to previous sections of this policy, no elected or appointed city official or employee of the city shall directly solicit anything of value, for any purpose, from an entity: 
a.  That is currently seeking to do business or subject to official action of, or is doing business with, the city, or is anticipated to be doing so in the immediate future; or 
b.  Whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the individual's official duties. 
(4)  Elected and appointed city officials and employees soliciting donations in compliance with this policy (i.e., either with approval or after restrictions no longer apply) from those that are or have previously engaged in the conduct set forth in previous sections of this policy shall make clear that such solicitations are not connected to or presented as requests for payment for services rendered and otherwise strive to avoid any semblance of impropriety. 
(5)  Those soliciting donations are prohibited from exerting any form of pressure upon those they have benefited through official acts. 
(6)  Elected and appointed city officials and employees shall not offer any form of special access to themselves in exchange for donations. 
(7)  Unless authorized by the board of aldermen, elected and appointed city officials and employees shall not solicit anything of value for a purpose unrelated to official city business through any means that may suggest that the solicitation is made with authority or on behalf of the city. 
(8)  Elected and appointed city officials shall not directly solicit anything of value from city employees. City employees shall not directly solicit anything of value from their subordinates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, employee-coordinated fund-raising campaigns for charitable or similar programs directed to all employees or a department of employees may be permitted as approved by the city administrator, and employees may collect money (solicit donations) for co-workers in recognition of a co-worker's retirement, birthday or a family member's death or in similar situations. 
(9)  Any communications related to a solicitation authorized hereunder shall be in a self-contained correspondence and not combined with other city business. 
(10)  Upon receipt by the city of any donation for a city-sponsored event or program, written communication from the mayor's office shall be sent to the donor acknowledging receipt of the donation, and a written statement from the city's finance department shall be sent to the donor within 60 days of the event or completion of the program confirming that the donated funds, goods or services were utilized by the city in connection with the event or program for which the funds, goods or services were donated.

(2)  Such other city-sponsored or city-supported special events and programs as approved by the city administrator or the board of aldermen. 
(d)  Exemptions. Nothing herein shall apply to: 
(1)  Donations of real property, or solicitations therefor, for establishing parks or other public places or for real property, or any interests therein, to facilitate public works projects; 
(2)  Nonprofit, 501(c)(3) or other recognized tax-exempt entities formed for or whose stated purpose is raising funds for, donating manpower, materials or real estate to, or otherwise supporting the city or governmental entities in general; 
(3)  Calls for assistance, actions or responses to natural disasters or other emergency situations affecting all or part of the community;

(2)  When that official has received, is receiving, or has been promised any consideration from any entity. 
(b)  No city official or employee shall favorably act on any matter that is so specifically designed to provide a special monetary benefit to such official or employee or his spouse or dependent children by reason of such act. This includes, but is not limited to, increases in retirement benefits, whether received from this state or a third party. 
(c)  To avoid the appearance of undue influence, except for any investigations as established by this Code, board members shall not interfere with administrative city officers or employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the mayor and city administrator.

(2)  Sell, rent or lease any property to the city for consideration in excess of $500.00 per annum, unless the transaction is made pursuant to an award on a contract let or a sale made after public notice and in the case of property other than real property, competitive bidding, provided that the bid or offer accepted is the lowest received.

(1)  Contracts let after competitive bidding has been advertised for by published notice; and 
(2)  Contracts for property or services for which the price or rate is fixed by law.

Sec. 125.150. - Participation in other matters. 
    A city official or employee shall not be deemed to have passed or acted upon any matter if the public official or employee abstains from any action regarding the matter. 
(Code 2008, § 125.150; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.160. - Restriction on former public officials or employees.

(1)  For a period of one year after termination of his office or employment, perform any service for consideration by which performance he attempts to influence a decision of the board of aldermen or any other board or commission of the city, or a decision of any official or employee over which he had supervisory power, except that this provision shall not be construed to prohibit any person from performing such service and receiving compensation therefor in any adversary proceeding or in the preparation or filing of any public document;

(3)  This section shall not apply if the former city official or employee, before he engages in or attempts to sell, makes a full disclosure to the board of aldermen of the former official's date of service and position with the city or employee's date of employment and position with the city and the board of aldermen determines that it is in the best interest of the city to permit the former official or employee to sell or attempt to sell such supplies, services or construction. 
(Code 2008, § 125.160; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.170. - Responsibilities under code of ethics. 
(a)  Employees. 
(1)  If an employee becomes aware of a violation of this policy, the concerns should be reported to the department director immediately. If the situation is not immediately resolved or if the employee is unable to address or is uncomfortable addressing the department director, he should report the incident to the city administrator or human resources. If the suspected violation involves an elected city official, he should report the incident to the city administrator who shall immediately notify the mayor, or the president of the board of aldermen if the mayor is an interested party. It may be helpful to make a written record of the date, time and nature of the incidents and the names of any witnesses. 
(2)  It is important to report concerns, regardless of the seriousness, as soon as possible. The city cannot assist in stopping violations of this policy if it is unaware of the problem. Publicizing information about alleged violations without following the appropriate reporting procedures might be considered evidence of a vexatious intent on part of the accuser. 
(b)  Department directors. Department directors must deal expeditiously and fairly with allegations of violations within their departments, whether or not there has been a written or formal complaint. Department directors must: 
(1)  Take all complaints or concerns of alleged or possible harassment or discrimination seriously, no matter how minor or who is involved. 
(2)  Ensure that the suspected violation is reported to the city administrator or human resources immediately so that a prompt investigation can occur. 
(3)  Take any appropriate action to prevent retaliation or prohibited conduct from reoccurring during and after any investigations or complaints. 
(4)  Department directors and supervisors who knowingly allow or tolerate violations of this policy shall be subject to discipline. 
(c)  City administrator, mayor or president of the board of aldermen. The city administrator and mayor, or president of the board of aldermen in the case of a conflict in the office of mayor, are responsible for: 
(1)  Explaining the city's code of ethics policy and investigation procedures to the person reporting the possible violation and the respondent. 
(2)  Exploring informal means of resolving complaints. 
(3)  Notifying the police if criminal activities are alleged. 
(4)  Arranging for an investigation, either internally or through a third party, of the alleged violation and the preparation of a written report. 
(Code 2008, § 125.170; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.180. - Advisory opinions. 
(a)  Where an employee has a doubt as to the applicability of any provision of this article to a particular situation regarding that employee or as to the definition of terms used herein, the employee may apply by signed writing to the city administrator for an advisory opinion. Elected officials and appointed officials shall have the right to apply to the city attorney for an advisory opinion regarding particular situations in which they are personally involved or as to the definition of terms used herein. The individual shall have the opportunity to present his interpretation of the facts at issue and of the applicability of provisions of this article before such advisory opinion is made. The application shall at a minimum provide sufficient detail to fully and accurately describe the situation and shall be certified as true to the best knowledge, information and belief of the applicant. The city administrator shall freely seek the advice and assistance of the city attorney where interpretation of the law is required. 
(b)  No person who relies upon an advisory opinion rendered pursuant to this chapter may be found in violation of this chapter, except where such opinion has been fraudulently obtained or where the person so relying failed to provide or omitted material facts in the request for the advisory opinion. 
(c)  Such opinion, until amended, distinguished or revoked, shall be binding on the city, the board of aldermen and the city administrator and city attorney in any subsequent actions concerning the elected official, appointed official or employee who sought the opinion and acted on it in good faith, unless material facts were omitted or misstated in the request for the advisory opinion. 
(d)  Any advisory opinion prepared by the city administrator or city attorney shall be in writing, and a copy shall be sent to the city clerk to be retained and made available to the public upon request. 
(Code 2008, § 125.180; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.190. - Resolution procedures. 
(a)  Reporting violations. Incidents of possible violations of this chapter should be reported using the following procedures: 
(1)  To assist the city in its investigation into an alleged violation of this policy, employees will often be asked to provide a written report of possible violation. Any report of possible violation should be submitted as soon as possible after an incident of alleged violation. The director of human resources may assist the person reporting the incident in completing a report of possible violation form. 
(2)  To ensure the prompt and thorough investigation of a complaint, the reporting person should provide as much of the following information as is possible: 
a.  The name, department and position of the person allegedly violating the code of ethics (respondents). 
b.  A description of the incidents, including the dates, locations and the presence of any witnesses. 
c.  Any other information the reporting person believes to be relevant to the complaint of violation. 
(b)  Handling records of reports of violations. While all employee inquiries and reports of possible violations are treated as confidentially as possible, employees understand that the city, as a public governmental body, strives to comply to the fullest with the state's open records and meetings laws, and has a duty to make public certain records of public concern. To that end, the following is a general statement of the city's policies on handling records relating to reports of possible violations: 
(1)  Reports of possible violations by employees. In keeping with the city's personnel policy and this Code, information contained in a report of possible violation regarding an employee is kept as confidential as possible. However, the identity of the reporting person usually is revealed to the respondent and witnesses. Retaliation against the reporting person will not be tolerated. All information pertaining to a report of possible violation or investigation is maintained by the director of human resources in secure files. 
(2)  Reports of possible violations by elected officials. Except where it has been decided to proceed pursuant to a criminal investigation by law enforcement, information contained in a report of possible violation regarding an elected official shall be made available to the public, except that in the case of a report of possible violation filed by an employee, the name of the employee shall be kept as confidential as possible. However, the identity of the reporting person usually is revealed to the respondent official and witnesses. Retaliation against the reporting person will not be tolerated. The report of possible violation may be made available to the public by the board of aldermen. An investigation of the report of possible violation shall be kept confidential until it is concluded. 
(3)  Responsibility of director of human resources. The director of human resources can answer any questions relating to the procedures for handling information related to reports of possible violations and investigations to reporting persons and respondents. 
(c)  Investigation of reports of possible violations. 
(1)  In the case of the report of possible violation involving an employee, the provisions of the personnel policy shall apply. 
(2)  Except where the report of possible violation involves an employee, any report of possible violation of the provisions of this chapter or RSMo ch. 105 believed by the disciplinary authority to have merit shall be presented to either: 
a.  An independent investigator; 
b.  The state ethics commission established under RSMo 105.955 ; or 
c.  May be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Upon receipt of any investigative report from either an independent investigator or the state ethics commission under RSMo 105.961 , as amended or revised, that indicates that there is probable cause that a violation has occurred, the appropriate disciplinary authority shall determine whether to follow the recommendations contained in the report within the time allowed by statute (including any stay resulting from an appeal) and whether to take any other appropriate disciplinary action. As provided by statute, in the case of a person that is an elected official, the appropriate disciplinary authority is the disinterested members of the board of aldermen, and in the case of a person that is an appointed official or employee, the appropriate disciplinary authority is the person with immediate supervisory authority over the person. However, the city administrator and board of aldermen retain their respective ultimate supervisory authority in such matters and may determine to act as the disciplinary authority as set forth in this Code and RSMo ch. 79 . 
(d)  Proceedings. 
(1)  In conjunction with determining whether to follow the recommendations of a report received from the independent investigator or state ethics commission or to take any other appropriate disciplinary action, the disciplinary authority shall determine: 
a.  If the subject of the report is an employee, then the provisions of the personnel policy and related laws and regulations shall apply and not those of subsections (d)(2) through (12) of this section. 
b.  If the subject of the report is not an employee, then the provisions of this subsection (d) shall apply. 
(2)  The disciplinary authority, if the matter was referred to the state ethics commission, may simply accept the decision of the commission without a hearing; or in the case of an independent investigation, may determine to take no further action. But, when a hearing is scheduled hereunder either in reference to a report from an independent investigator or in further action on a decision of the state ethics commission, the reporting person and respondent shall be given reasonable notice thereof by certified mail. However, if the respondent agrees that he has committed a violation as alleged in the complaint, the appropriate disciplinary authority will not hold a hearing, but instead will promptly hold a public meeting to consider the matter and render a decision regarding the appropriate discipline or penalty. 
(3)  The hearing shall be held within 20 days of the receipt of the investigative report, unless: 
a.  The respondent requests a later date not to exceed 20 additional days. 
b.  The disciplinary authority itself determines that more time is required, not to exceed 20 additional days. 
On request from the respondent, the disciplinary authority may grant an expedited date for the hearing. 
(4)  The disciplinary authority may meet prior to the hearing to prepare for the hearing. Such a meeting shall be a work meeting, and no evidence, testimony, or public comments will be accepted during such a meeting. The respondent shall not participate in the work meeting, as doing so will be deemed a conflict of interest in violation of this chapter and an improper ex parte communication with the disciplinary authority. The work meeting shall be open to the public, but portions of the meeting may be closed for discussions with legal counsel pursuant to RSMo 610.021(1) . 
(5)  The hearing shall be conducted in the manner most conducive to the determination of the truth, and the disciplinary authority shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. Decisions made shall not be invalidated by any informality in the proceedings. 
(6)  Hearings shall be open meetings under the open meetings and records policy of the city (chapter 112). Notice of the hearing shall be posted in conformance with the above-stated policy. 
(7)  All hearings shall be conducted as follows: 
a.  The disciplinary authority shall receive evidence from: 
1.  The independent investigator or the state ethics commission (in the form of its report or decision); 
2.  The reporting person; 
3.  The respondent; 
4.  Any other witnesses called by the above parties; and 
5.  Any other person the disciplinary authority deems necessary. 
b.  Opening statements and closing arguments shall be permitted. The disciplinary authority may request any witnesses to appear at a fixed time or the production of any records or material evidence. Failure or inability of the reporting person to appear or produce evidence shall not be grounds for dismissal. The respondent is entitled to present his witnesses and evidence in defense. Rebuttal may be permitted. 
c.  Parties will be allowed to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The disciplinary authority may also examine witnesses directly or through its counsel. 
d.  Both the reporting person and the respondent may be represented by legal counsel at their own expense. 
(8)  The disciplinary authority shall determine the relevancy, weight and credibility of testimony and evidence. The disciplinary authority shall base its findings on the preponderance of evidence. 
(9)  The hearing may be continued by the disciplinary authority to allow for additional information to be presented. The disciplinary authority may set time constraints on the proceedings. 
(10)  The city attorney shall serve as counsel to the disciplinary authority, but to avoid any conflict or appearance of thereof, shall not present evidence or conduct the hearing on behalf of the city; the city may use the prosecuting attorney or employ special counsel to put on evidence or conduct the hearing for the city. 
(11)  A transcript of the hearing shall be made unless waived by the reporting person, the respondent and the disciplinary authority. 
(12)  Within three business days of the close of the hearing, the respondent, reporting party and counsel for the city before the disciplinary authority may submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for use and consideration of the disciplinary authority. 
(e)  Decisions. The disciplinary authority, upon completion of a hearing or admission of a violation, shall render a written decision within ten business days after the deadline for receipt of any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The decision shall: 
(1)  Determine whether a violation occurred; 
(2)  Set forth any necessary requirements for voluntary compliance, if applicable; 
(3)  Take other actions under section 125.200 or recommend action by the authorized city officials as deemed appropriate under the circumstances; and 
(4)  Recommend any appropriate prosecution under applicable state or local law, if applicable. 
(f)  Willful concealment. If a city official or employee willfully conceals a substantial financial interest in violation or otherwise willfully violates the requirements of this chapter, such person shall be guilty of malfeasance in office or position and shall forfeit all offices and positions with the city. 
(g)  Complicity by private sector. If a person or business entity who makes a contract or sale with the city knows or should have known that a city official or employee has violated this chapter's provisions regarding such contract or sale, the city administrator or the board of aldermen may declare the contract or sale void within 30 days after the determination that the official or employee violated this chapter. 
(h)  Proceeding not exclusive. The procedures set forth herein are for the disciplinary authority's guidance, edification and use. The disciplinary authority may vary the proceedings where it deems necessary and appropriate under the given circumstances. 
(Code 2008, § 125.190; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.200. - Discipline. 
(a)  Employees who are determined to have violated this policy are subject to appropriate discipline. If an investigation results in a finding that this policy has been violated, the mandatory minimum discipline is a written reprimand and the maximum discipline is termination of employment. 
(b)  City-elected officials who are determined to have violated this policy are subject to appropriate discipline. If an investigation results in a finding that this policy has been violated, the mandatory minimum discipline is a public censure and the maximum discipline is removal from office. 
(c)  Any employee or official found to have knowingly made a false report of possible violation shall be subject to discipline as set forth herein. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the city's right to pursue civil damages or criminal penalties against persons arising out of violations of this policy. 
(Code 2008, § 125.200; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015) 
Sec. 125.210. - Other available procedures; administration. 
    The procedures available under this policy do not pre-empt or supersede any legal procedures or remedies otherwise available under state or federal law. This policy will be administered through the city administrator. 
(Code 2008, § 125.210; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 1, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3318, § 1, 8-14-2013; Ord. No. 3517, § 1, 9-9-2015)

ARTICLE II. - POSITION CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLAN 

Sec. 135.200. - Preparation, adoption and amendment. 
    A position classification and compensation plan shall be prepared by the city administrator and submitted to the board of aldermen for adoption in conjunction with the annual budget. The classification and compensation plan shall include the proposed classifications and a pay grade for each classification. 
(Code 2006, § 135.290; Code 2008, § 135.290; Ord. No. 2481, § 1, 3-22-2006; Ord. No. 2017-3808, § 1(135.200), 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 135.210. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the position classification and compensation plan is to assemble positions into classes of employees whose duties and responsibilities are sufficiently alike to be grouped under the same descriptive job title, to be accorded the same pay grade and to require similar qualifications for employment. 
(Code 2006, § 135.150; Code 2008, § 135.150; Ord. No. 2481, § 1, 3-22-2006; Ord. No. 2017-3808, § 1(135.210), 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 135.220. - Use of classification plan. 
    The classification plan is to be used: 
(1)  As a guide in recruiting and examining candidates for employment; 
(2)  In determining lines of promotion and in developing employee-training programs; 
(3)  In determining compensation to be paid for various types of work; 
(4)  In providing uniform job terminology understandable by all city officials and employees and by the general public. 
(Code 2006, § 135.160; Code 2008, § 135.160; Ord. No. 2481, § 1, 3-22-2006; Ord. No. 2017-3808, § 1(135.220), 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 135.230. - Class. 
    The position classification plan shall include titles and written specifications for the various classes of positions. Each class shall include all positions in the classified service, which are sufficiently similar with respect to duties, responsibilities and authority so that the same descriptive title may be used to designate each position allocated to the class. Specifications shall show minimum requirements for education, experience, general and specialized knowledge, skill, physical conditions and other qualifications necessary for the proper performance of the positions. Specifications will be descriptive and explanatory of the kind of work required in a given classification but are not inclusive of all the duties to be performed. The specifications shall be used for the purposes of recruiting, testing and selection. Reasonable accommodations shall be made on an individual basis. 
(Code 2006, § 135.170; Code 2008, § 135.170; Ord. No. 2481, § 1, 3-22-2006; Ord. No. 2017-3808, § 1(135.230), 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 135.240. - Administration of the plan. 
    The approved position classification plan shall be maintained by human resources. A request for reclassification of an existing position or the classification of a proposed position may be filed by a department director and submitted to the city administrator. 
(Code 2006, § 135.180; Code 2008, § 135.180; Ord. No. 2481, § 1, 3-22-2006; Ord. No. 2017-3808, § 1(135.240), 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 135.250. - Salary administration guidelines. 
(a)  Salary changes. A salary change is defined as any change in an employee's base wage rate. Changes will only be processed in accordance with the following guidelines. 
(b)  Pay raises. Pay raises, or advancement through the city pay plan, are based on the annual budget allocation as approved by the board of aldermen and individual annual performance scores. The city may also make individual pay raises based on merit or due to a change of job position. 
(c)  Salary structure. The salary structure has established pay grades for all positions within the city based on the level of difficulty of the job, job responsibility, and qualifications required. Each pay grade has 15 steps (numbered 1 through 15). Employees who have written employment agreements ("contracted employees") are excluded from the step and grade salary structure. All other positions are assigned to one of the following pay grades: 
PAY GRADES 
General (non-contractual) Employees A-P Law Enforcement P-1 through P-6 Seasonal SEAS0-SEAS4  
(d)  Step increases. Within-pay-grade step increases are based on an acceptable level of performance. Employees receiving a composite score of 2.5 or higher on their annual performance evaluation will be eligible for the annual step increase. It typically takes 15 years to advance from Step 1 to Step 15 within a single pay grade if an employee remains in that single pay grade. However, employees with outstanding (or equivalent) performance ratings may be considered for additional, quality step increases (maximum of one per year), which must be approved by the city administrator. 
(e)  Salary structure adjustments. 
(1)  Purpose. The city salary structure may be adjusted annually to ensure that it remains competitive with markets from which it attracts talented employees. 
(2)  Salary structure adjustment procedures. On an annual basis, human resources will review the salary structures in consideration of changing economic and competitive factors as determined by city-approved published salary surveys and other data sources. When deemed necessary, human resources will recommend an appropriate salary structure adjustment to the city administrator. Salary structures will be adjusted as approved by the board of aldermen. Any employee whose salary is below the minimum of the assigned updated salary range will receive a pay adjustment at least equal to the difference between actual salary and the salary range minimum. 
(f)  Determining pay for promotions and demotions. A promotion occurs when an employee moves to a job in a higher pay grade or range. Reclassification to a higher pay grade does not constitute a promotion. A transfer occurs when an employee transfers to another position in the same pay grade as the position previously occupied. In such cases, the employee shall not be eligible for a pay increase at the time of such transfer. Employees may be eligible for a raise with city administrator approval. A demotion occurs when an employee's position is reassessed to a lower pay grade or when an employee is transferred to a position in a lower pay grade typically due to reorganization. A demotion also occurs when an employee voluntarily accepts a position in a lower pay grade than the position occupied. 
(1)  Determining pay for promotion procedures. City employees may advance to higher pay grades by promotion. In this case, the employee will be placed on a step at the new grade at a rate that exceeds the current salary. The new rate will be determined by the department director and approved by the city administrator. Human resources will provide salary pay grades, individual pay information and promotion adjustment guidelines to each department director upon the promotion of an employee. The department director will determine the promotional increase step according to the pay adjustment guidelines. Promotion-based salary adjustments are in addition to general increases if the promotion is made at the time of the annual wage adjustment. 
(2)  Determining pay for demotion procedures. In the case of a demotion resulting from poor performance, re-classification of a position or employee choice, the employee will be placed in the lower salary grade between steps 1-7. In no case shall the newly established salary exceed the previous rate of pay. 
(g)  Determining pay for temporary promotions. Employees, who are given a temporary assignment to a higher classification, will receive a pay differential to recognize the increased responsibility during the temporary assignment. An employee working a minimum of 20 consecutive work days in that position will receive, retroactively, a temporary increase to the minimum of the new pay grade. If the employee who is temporarily assigned to a new position is currently being paid at a rate that is above the minimum of the pay range for the position that he/she is temporarily filling, the employee will be placed on a step at the new grade at a rate that exceeds the employee's current salary. The new rate will be determined by the department director and approved by the city administrator. At the conclusion of the temporary assignment, the employee will return to the employee's previous pay rate. Non-exempt employees temporarily assigned to exempt positions will remain non-exempt and eligible for overtime payments if applicable, exceptions may be granted by the city administrator. 
(h)  Requested review of a job's pay grade assignment. A job reassignment occurs when a job is moved to a different pay grade because the essential job functions have significantly changed. Department directors and employees may request a review of the evaluation of their job during a specified time frame each year. Specific requests to human resources must be approved by the employee's department director and routed through human resources and the city administrator. The following procedures will be followed for reassignment of an existing position. 
(1)  Except in unusual circumstances, requests for reassessment may be made annually in concert with budget preparation. Each year, human resources will notify departments of the period within which any position reassessments must be considered. A review of a position's classification is warranted when there has been a material, significant and permanent change in job duties. The direct supervisor or department director is responsible for recognizing such job changes. Additionally, an employee who believes his or her job is not properly evaluated may request of his or her supervisor a reassessment. 
(2)  When the supervisor and department director conclude that a material, significant, and permanent change in job duties has occurred, a job analysis questionnaire (JAQ) should be completed by the employee, reviewed by the supervisor and sent through the department director to human resources. 
(3)  Upon receipt of a newly completed JAQ, human resources will perform an assessment of the duties and responsibilities of the position using a review of relative internal worth and a review of published salary surveys. This process may include an interview with the employee and/or supervisor. Following this evaluation, human resources will determine if the job should remain as presently assigned or if a new assignment is appropriate. The department director will be notified in writing of the results. 
(4)  If upon the evaluation of a job, human resources determines that a job is still within the same pay grade, no salary adjustment will be made. In the instance where an employee's job is reassigned to a lower pay grade, the employee will be moved to the step that is equal to or immediately above the employee's current salary in the new pay grade; however, the reclassified pay grade maximum will define the limit of future pay increases. In the instance where an employee's job is reassigned to a higher pay grade, generally the employee's pay shall be adjusted in an amount equal to at least two steps at the pay grade immediately before the reclassification to the higher pay grade. Where such a change has a neutral budget impact, such change may be approved by the city administrator. Where such a change impacts a department's budget, such change must be approved by the board of aldermen. 
(5)  When there is disagreement regarding the reassessment of a position, an appeal may be made in writing to the director of human resources. 
(i)  Establishing initial pay for new hires. It is the goal of the city to offer wages that attract the best possible employees. It is also the goal of the city to ensure pay fairness among employees within similar job titles. Therefore, a new employee's initial pay should be set in consideration of the candidate's qualifications as defined by required knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), the pay of other similarly employed individuals, the pay and pay scales of supervised employees and external market factors. The following procedures will be followed for establishing initial pay for newly hired employees. 
(1)  New hires must be offered at least the minimum of the salary range of the position. The department director will carefully review the applicant's qualifications in relation to the job's KSAs, external market factors and the current wages of individuals employed in similar titles. It is typical that human resources will provide guidance to the department director regarding market pay for the position. It is anticipated that most salary offers will be between Steps 1-7 of the pay grade. 
(2)  The department director will recommend to human resources a beginning salary that is attractive to the prospective employee, addresses market pay influences and is fair to existing employees. Beginning salaries for new employees should not be set at a rate greater than the salaries of existing employees with equivalent qualifications within the same job title in order to reduce the possibility of compression issues. 
(3)  Salary offers will be prepared by the hiring manager and forwarded to the department director, city administrator and HR for approval. The hiring manager may then communicate the offer to the prospective employee or defer to HR. 
(4)  A new city employee is usually hired at step one of the applicable pay grade. However, in special circumstances, the city administrator may authorize a higher step rate for a newly appointed employee based on experience of the prospective employee, or in unusual circumstances, where market conditions prohibit hiring within the authorized hiring pay grade and/or the current pay. Current city employees who move to a new position and are not considered newly appointed may have pay set above step one based only on a previous rate of pay. 
(5)  No internal equity adjustments will be made based upon a new hire's rate of pay. Any new hires above minimum required written justification to be included on the initial personnel action form/wage adjustment form. 
(j)  Assignment of a new job to a pay grade. Human resources is responsible for the assessment of proposed new positions and subsequent assignment to a pay grade. All jobs will be assessed according to the city's compensation plan based on published salary data and internal comparable value. This plan establishes a consistent basis for measuring and ranking the relative market worth of each job. The following procedures will be followed for assignment of new positions to a pay grade. 
(1)  Following approval to create a new position, the department director, or a designee, completes a job analysis questionnaire (JAQ) or drafts a job description describing the duties to be assigned to the position. 
(2)  The department director submits the JAQ/job description to human resources for assessment. 
(3)  All new and existing jobs are to be assigned to a pay grade based on their relative worth either determined by city-approved published salary survey data or the city's determination of relative internal worth. The first step is to determine if market pay information exists for the job in city-approved published salary surveys. Human resources will compare job duties and responsibilities noted on the JAQ/job description to the definitions found in published salary surveys. The job will be assigned to the appropriate pay grade by comparing the salary survey data to the current salary structure. 
(4)  If the job does not sufficiently match a salary survey definition it is compared to other jobs within the department. This is accomplished by evaluating and ranking the position based upon its relative worth. Human resources conducts this assessment of the duties and responsibilities of the position and in consultation with the department director, confirms the position title and assigns a pay grade. 
(5)  The department director is notified in writing of the position title and pay grade assignment after which recruitment for the vacancy may begin. The assigned pay grade provides a spread from a minimum to a maximum rate. New employee compensation within any pay grade is based on such factors as KSAs and external market factors. All new positions must be approved by the board of aldermen. 
(6)  When there is disagreement regarding a position assessment, an appeal may be made to the city administrator. The decision of the city administrator will be final. 
(k)  Market-based pay adjustments. 
(1)  Competitive levels. The city strives to pay at levels that are competitive with the market. Salary adjustments may be made to employee salaries to address significant discrepancies between the city's level of pay and market pay levels for jobs. Actual adjustment amounts will be based on the city's capability to pay. 
(2)  Market-based pay adjustment procedures. Human resources will periodically perform market compatibility evaluations. A market compatibility evaluation may be performed during the first half of each calendar year. The evaluation will be based upon comparable salary and benefit packages of competitor employers in the region. Market adjustments to pay up to 100 percent of the average market rate of pay for critical or essential positions may be recommended by department directors with concurrence by the director of human resources for consideration by the city administrator. All market adjustments must be approved by the board of aldermen. 
(l)  Pay above grade maximum. The compensation system is a tool used by the city to provide a rational basis for pay decisions. It helps to ensure that positions are not underpaid or overpaid based on job responsibilities and the competitive labor markets from which employees are recruited. The pay grade assigned to each position indicates the value of the position within the city. For any employee whose pay is at or above the maximum for his or her pay grade, a temporary increase will be added to the employee's base pay for the fiscal year, not to exceed 2.5 percent.

Sec. 135.320. - Overtime and compensatory time. 
(a)  Employees other than commissioned law enforcement personnel and corrections officers who are not exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act will be paid at time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours during the standard workweek. Except in cases of an emergency, prior approval of the department director, or the employee's supervisor or the city administrator is required before working overtime. 
(b)  Commissioned law enforcement personnel and corrections officers who are not exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act will be paid at time and one-half their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 851/2 in a 14-consecutive-day period. Hours worked over 851/2 in a 14-consecutive-day period will be paid at time and one-half as overtime or compensatory time, as requested by the employee. If a corrections employee is near 40 hours of his/her maximum accrued comp time and if a commissioned employee is near 100 hours of his/her maximum accrued comp time and then works more than 851/2 hours in a 14-consecutive-day period and such hours will put him/her over the maximum amount of comp time accrued, then such hours will be paid as overtime. Except in cases of an emergency, prior approval of the chief of police, or the employee's supervisor or the city administrator is required before working overtime. 
(c)  As required under state law, employees in amusement or recreational facilities shall receive 11/2 times their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 52 in a single workweek. This may apply to the aquatic, camp and concessions staff.

The maximum compensatory time accruals are 40 hours for general employees, dispatch and corrections, and 100 hours for commissioned employees. The city administrator may approve exceptions to these maximum accrual amounts. If an employee is near his/her maximum accrued compensatory time and then works more than 40 hours in a workweek (or 851/2 hours in a 14-day pay period applicable to commissioned employees) and such hours would put the employee over the maximum amount of compensatory time allowed, the hours will be paid as overtime. Part-time employees are not eligible for compensatory time. 
(e)  For purposes of calculating overtime hours: 
(1)  General employees. The phrase "hours worked," as used in this section, includes actual hours worked, vacation time, floating holiday, safety day, employee of the quarter, employee of the year and holidays used in the workweek.

(3)  Exemption. As allowed under the section 7(K) exemption of the FLSA (for commissioned officers and correction technicians), any combination of the above hours, not including holiday hours, exceeding 85.50 hours in a two-week pay period, will generate overtime. 
(f)  When an employee is required to work additional hours during a workweek in response to an unscheduled designated health/life/safety urgent event, the hours used to calculate overtime hours for such workweek shall include all hours actually worked during the workweek as well as any approved leave time taken during the workweek, including vacation time, floating holiday, safety day, day off for employee of the quarter, day off for employee of the year, holiday, sick time, jury duty, compensatory time taken and any safety day taken. These events may include significant weather events, water main breaks, flooding, etc. Official designation of each event shall be made by the department director and approved by the city administrator based on the individual circumstances per departmental procedures.

CHAPTER 150. - ANTI-FRAUD AND CORRUPTION POLICY 

Sec. 150.010. - Purpose and applicability; declaration of policy. 
    The purpose of this policy is to establish a method of reporting fraud or corruption within the city in order to minimize the risk of internal and external fraud, theft of city assets, fraudulent financial reporting, or corruption within the employee ranks or board of aldermen. This policy addresses the responsibility of employees, volunteers, elected and appointed officials for detecting and reporting fraud or suspected fraud, corruption, or dishonest activities. The city is determined to protect itself and the public from fraud, corruption, and dishonest activities and is committed to maintaining a strategy for the prevention, detection and eradication of fraud, corruption, and dishonest activities. 
(Code 2008, § 150.010; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.020. - Policy. 
    Management is responsible for the detection and prevention of fraud, misappropriations and other inappropriate conduct. Management also recognizes that a key preventative measure in the fight against fraud and corruption is to employ staff and appoint officials who have high standards in terms of propriety, integrity and fiscal responsibility. Further, all employees and officials of the city government have a duty to residents of the city to ensure that city resources are prudently used in accordance with federal, state, and local law, as well as good judgment where the law is silent. Management is further committed to continuously improving the systems for which it is responsible, both through its own assessments and by positive and prompt responses to audit recommendations. It is, therefore, the intent of the mayor, board of aldermen of the city and the city administrator to promote consistent organizational behavior by providing guidelines and assigning responsibility for the development of controls, management of reporting processes and facilitation of proper and prudent investigations to aid in the detection and prevention of fraud against the city. 
(Code 2008, § 150.020; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.030. - Fraud and corruption. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Corruption means the offering, giving, soliciting, or acceptance of any inducement or reward that may influence actions taken by an employee or official. 
    Fraud means an intentional, false representation or concealment of a material fact that leads to a financial advantage to the perpetrator or other upon whose behalf he acts. 
(b)  Fraud incorporates theft, larceny, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, false pretenses, forgery, corrupt practices and falsification of accounts. Fraud or other wrongful acts may include: 
(1)  Forgery or alteration of a check, bank draft, or other financial document or account belonging to the city. 
(2)  Falsifying time sheets, expense reports, or other report documents. 
(3)  Misappropriation of funds, securities, supplies, or other assets. 
(4)  Impropriety in handling or reporting of money or financial transactions. 
(5)  Disclosing confidential or proprietary information to outside parties. 
(6)  Seeking or accepting after seeking anything with material value or any gratuity of any amount from anyone other than the city as part of the employee or official's normal pay for performing one's duties. Employees and officials should never solicit anything of material value for themselves or others in connection with the rendition of public service. 
(7)  Unauthorized destruction, removal, or any other inappropriate use of records, furniture, fixtures, equipment, materials or supplies, or any similar or related irregularity. 
(8)  Authorizing or receiving payments for hours not worked.

(Code 2008, § 150.030; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.040. - Management responsibility. 
(a)  Management is responsible for detecting fraud, corruption or related dishonest activities in their areas of responsibility. Each department director, manager, or supervisor should be familiar with the types of improprieties that might occur in their area. Furthermore, they should be alert for any indication that improper activity, misappropriation, or dishonest activity is or was in existence in his area of responsibility. When an improper activity is detected or suspected, management should determine whether an error or mistake has occurred or if there may be fraud, corruption or dishonest activity. 
(b)  Management is responsible for taking appropriate corrective actions in accordance with their training to ensure adequate controls exist to prevent recurrence of improper actions. 
(c)  Great care must be taken in the dealing with suspected dishonest, corrupt or fraudulent activities to avoid incorrect accusations, alerting suspected individuals that an investigation is underway, treating persons unfairly, or making statements that could lead to claims of false accusations or other offenses. Individuals who knowingly make false accusations may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(Code 2008, § 150.040; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.050. - Reporting suspicious activities. 
(a)  Employees, officials and others have an obligation to report criminal conduct or suspicious activity and should be able to do so without fear of retaliation or reprisal. When suspected fraud, corruption or dishonest incidents or practices are observed by or made known to any employee, the suspected incident or practices shall be reported. Reports should be made to the employee's supervisor (see the city's organizational chart). However, if the employee believes the supervisor may be involved in the inappropriate activity, the employee should make the report directly to the next higher level of supervision, who shall then notify the city administrator, or human resources, if the suspected activity involved the city administrator. Individuals other than employees of the city who have knowledge of suspicious activities should report the inappropriate activity directly to the city administrator or to the mayor if the suspected activity involves the city administrator. 
(b)  Reports should be presented with the following information: the date on which the criminal conduct or suspicious activity occurred, if known, a description of activity and the names of anyone involved in the activity. These reports will then be immediately submitted to the city's external auditor for documenting and future review. 
(c)  The reporting individual should refrain from further investigation of the incident, confrontation of the alleged violator, or further discussion of the incident with anyone unless requested to do so by management. 
(d)  Employees and officials serve as the eyes and ears of the city. Their vigilance serves as a strong deterrent against fraud, corruption or other dishonest practices or behaviors. Every employee and official has an obligation to report fraud, corruption or dishonest practices. 
(Code 2008, § 150.050; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.060. - No reprisal for reporting suspicious activities. 
    It is the policy of the city that no employee or official shall be subject to recrimination or any other form of punishment on the basis that they reported what was reasonably believed to be an act of wrongdoing or a violation of policies of the city. However, an employee may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and an official would face board censure or similar consequences, if the city reasonably concludes that the report of wrongdoing was knowingly fabricated or was knowingly distorted, exaggerated or minimized to either injure or to protect another party or oneself. A person whose report of misconduct contains admissions of personal wrongdoing will not, however, be guaranteed protection from disciplinary or similar action. The weight to be given to the self-confession will depend on all the facts known to the city at the time it makes its decisions. In determining what, if any, action may be taken, the city will review the facts of the case. 
(Code 2008, § 150.060; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.070. - Investigation. 
    The city administrator or his designee will investigate situations involving possible fraud, corruption, or related dishonest activity. If appropriate, the external auditing firm for the city may be informed of all situations of alleged violations of this policy and the results of the required investigations. The investigation requires the full cooperation of all city personnel and officials. If the alleged fraud involves the city administrator, the mayor shall designate a person to conduct the investigation. If this investigation uncovers evidence showing fraud, corruption or dishonest activities by an employee, the city administrator (if not directly involved in the allegations) will determine what disciplinary or legal actions should be taken. If the city administrator is directly involved in the allegations, or if an elected or appointed official is involved, the mayor and board of aldermen will determine what disciplinary or legal actions should be taken regarding such individuals. 
(Code 2008, § 150.070; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 150.080. - Preventive measures. 
(a)  Management of the city recognizes that the implementation of preventive and deterrent measures guard against corruption and fraudulent activities occurring within the confines of the city government. 
(b)  The city in conjunction with its external auditors shall annually re-evaluate areas of its internal control procedures and modify them as necessary to improve these areas. 
(c)  The human resources department shall be responsible to provide training to all employees regarding the definitions, detection, proper reporting, and investigation of fraud, corruption and other related activity, as well as training on any internal control procedures that are implemented and the time of employment and every three years thereafter. Such training will be conducted with training on the code of ethics (chapter 125) and political activity (chapter 155). 
(Code 2008, § 150.080; Ord. No. 2013-3271, § 2, 1-16-2013; Ord. No. 3556, § 2, 12-9-2015) 
Sec. 150.090. - Conclusion. 
    The city is consistently working to improve the current systems and procedures to deter, detect, and investigate fraud, corruption and dishonest activities. The city will ensure that these arrangements are fair, widely publicized and available to all employees and officials. The arrangements will be monitored and updated to keep pace with future developments in prevention, deterrence, and detection techniques regarding fraud, corruption and dishonest activity.

While all employee and elected official inquiries and reports of possible violations are treated as confidentially as possible, employees and elected officials understand that the city, as a public governmental body, strives to comply to the fullest with the state's open records and meetings laws, and has a duty to make public certain records of public concern. To that end, the following is a general statement of the city's policies on handling records relating to reports of possible violations: 
(1)  Reports of possible violations by employees. In keeping with city personnel policy, information contained in a report of possible violation regarding an employee is kept as confidential as possible. However, the identity of the reporting person usually is revealed to the respondent and witnesses. Retaliation against the reporting person will not be tolerated. All information pertaining to a report of possible violation or investigation is maintained by the director of human resources in secure files. 
(2)  Reports of possible violations by elected officials. A report of a potential violation by an elected official will generally be reported promptly to the respondent public official, unless there is a legitimate reason to not disclose the alleged violation to the respondent public official based on the safety of the reporting individual, the integrity of the investigation or direction from the state ethics commission or a law enforcement agency. Except where it has been decided to proceed pursuant to a criminal investigation by law enforcement, information contained in a report of possible violation regarding an elected official shall be made available to the public, except that in the case of a report of possible violation filed by an employee, the name of the employee shall be kept as confidential as possible. However, the identity of the reporting person usually is revealed to the respondent official and witnesses. Retaliation against the reporting person will not be tolerated. The report of possible violation may be made available to the public by the board of aldermen. An investigation of the report of possible violation shall be kept confidential until it is concluded. 
(3)  Director of human resources answering questions relating to reports of possible violations. The director of human resources can answer any questions relating to the procedures for handling information related to reports of possible violations and investigations to reporting persons and respondents. 
(c)  Investigation of reports of possible violations. 
(1)  In the case of the report of possible violation involving an employee, the provisions of the personnel policy shall apply. 
(2)  Except where the report of possible violation involves an employee, any report of possible violation of the provisions of this chapter believed by the disciplinary authority to have merit shall be presented to either: 
a.  An independent investigator; or 
b.  The state ethics commission established under RSMo 105.955 or its successor; or 
may be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency if criminal conduct is suspected. 
(d)  Proceedings. 
(1)  In the case of a person who is an elected official, the appropriate disciplinary authority is the disinterested members of the board of aldermen, and in the case of a person who is an employee, the appropriate disciplinary authority is the person with immediate supervisory authority over such person. However, the city administrator and board of aldermen retain their respective ultimate supervisory authority in such matters and may determine to act as the disciplinary authority as set forth in this Code and RSMo ch. 79 . 
(2)  Upon receipt of any investigative report from either an independent investigator or the state ethics commission under RSMo 105.961 , which indicates that there is probable cause that a violation has occurred, the appropriate disciplinary authority shall determine whether to follow the recommendations contained in the report within the time allowed by statute (including any stay resulting from an appeal) and whether to take any other appropriate disciplinary action. 
(3)  The disciplinary authority, if the matter was referred to the state ethics commission, may simply accept the decision of the commission without a hearing; or in the case of an independent investigation, may determine to take no further action. But, when a hearing is scheduled hereunder either in reference to a report from an independent investigator or in further action on a decision of the state ethics commission, the reporting person and respondent shall be given reasonable notice thereof by certified mail. However, if the respondent agrees that he has committed a violation as alleged in the complaint, the appropriate disciplinary authority will not hold a hearing, but instead will promptly hold a public meeting to consider the matter and render a decision regarding the appropriate discipline or penalty. 
(4)  The hearing shall be held within 20 days of the receipt of the investigative report, unless: 
a.  The respondent requests a later date not to exceed 20 additional days. 
b.  The disciplinary authority itself determines that more time is required, not to exceed 20 additional days. 
c.  On request from the respondent, the disciplinary authority may grant an expedited date for the hearing. 
(5)  The disciplinary authority may meet prior to the hearing to prepare for the hearing. Such a meeting shall be a work meeting, and no evidence, testimony, or public comments will be accepted during such a meeting. The respondent shall not participate in the work meeting, as doing so will be deemed a conflict of interest in violation of this chapter and an improper ex parte communication with the disciplinary authority. The work meeting shall be open to the public, but portions of the meeting may be closed for discussions with legal counsel pursuant to RSMo 610.021(1) . 
(6)  The hearing shall be conducted in the manner most conducive to the determination of the truth and the disciplinary authority shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. Decisions made shall not be invalidated by any informality in the proceedings. 
(7)  Hearings shall be open meetings under the open meetings and records policy of the city. Notice of the hearing shall be posted in conformance with the above-stated policy. 
(8)  All hearings shall be conducted as follows: 
a.  The disciplinary authority shall receive evidence from: 
1.  The independent investigator or the state ethics commission (in the form of its report or decision); 
2.  The reporting person; 
3.  The respondent; 
4.  Any other witnesses called by the above parties; and 
5.  Any other person the disciplinary authority deems necessary. 
b.  Opening statements and closing arguments shall be permitted. The disciplinary authority may request any witnesses to appear at a fixed time or the production of any records or material evidence. Failure or inability of the reporting person to appear or produce evidence shall not be grounds for dismissal. The respondent is entitled to present his witnesses and evidence in defense. Rebuttal may be permitted. 
c.  Parties will be allowed to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The disciplinary authority may also examine witnesses directly or through its counsel. 
d.  Both the reporting person and the respondent may be represented by legal counsel at their own expense. 
(9)  The disciplinary authority shall determine the relevancy, weight and credibility of the testimony and evidence. The disciplinary authority shall base its findings on the preponderance of evidence. 
(10)  The hearing may be continued by the disciplinary authority to allow for additional information to be presented. The disciplinary authority may set time constraints on the proceedings. 
(11)  The city attorney shall serve as counsel to the disciplinary authority, but to avoid any conflict or appearance thereof, shall not present evidence or conduct the hearing on behalf of the city; the city may use the prosecuting attorney or employ special counsel to put on evidence or conduct the hearing for the city. 
(12)  A transcript of the hearing shall be made unless waived by the reporting person, the respondent and the disciplinary authority. 
(13)  Within three business days of the close of the hearing, the respondent, reporting party and counsel for the city before the disciplinary authority may submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for the use and consideration of the disciplinary authority. 
(e)  Decisions. The disciplinary authority, upon completion of a hearing or admission of a violation, shall render a written decision within ten business days after the deadline for receipt of any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Any decision finding a violation of this chapter by an elected official must be based on an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of those persons elected to the office of alderman, excluding any alderman who is the subject of the hearing. The decision shall: 
(1)  Determine whether or not a violation occurred; 
(2)  Set forth any necessary requirements for voluntary compliance, if applicable; 
(3)  Take other actions under section 155.090 or recommend action by the authorized city officials as deemed appropriate under the circumstances; and 
(4)  Recommend any appropriate prosecution under applicable state or local law, if applicable. 
(f)  Willful violation. In the event that a city official or employee willfully violates the requirements of this chapter, such person shall be guilty of malfeasance in office or position and shall forfeit all offices and positions with the city. 
(g)  Proceeding not exclusive. The procedures set forth herein are for the disciplinary authority's guidance, edification and use. The disciplinary authority may vary the proceedings where it deems necessary and appropriate under the given circumstances.

An animal subject to the provisions of section 205.390 shall be released or euthanized in conjunction with the provisions of that section. 
(b)  The division of humane services is authorized to allow confinement other than as described provided in subsection (a) of this section, such animal will be controlled and observed in accordance with the owner's signed agreement. Preconditions for quarantine at home would be that the animal must have current rabies vaccination, not have a recent history of being at large; the animal is not displaying a sudden change in disposition, and the owner has both the ability and desire to keep the animal in a secure building and separate from other animals.

(Code 2008, § 205.470; Ord. No. 3544, § 2, 11-18-2015) 
Sec. 205.380. - Procedure for dangerous dog declaration and bite incidents. 
(a)  Whenever the director learns that a dog has bitten a human being or another domestic animal, the director shall record the incident and determine whether the division has records of prior incidents in which the dog in question has bitten human beings or domestic animals. The director may consider information that the dog in question has bitten human beings or domestic animals in other cities or counties when that information is received, in writing, from the individuals responsible for animal control in that city or county. 
(b)  If the director finds no records of such prior incidents, and the director determines that the bite was a provoked attack in which a human being or domestic animal has been injured and required medical care from a physician or veterinarian or was an unprovoked attack in which a human being or domestic animal was not injured and did not require medical care, the director shall give the dog's owner an educational packet prepared by the division stating the division's procedures in bite cases and the division's recommendations for animal care and for handling dogs that have bitten. If the director determines that the bite was an unprovoked attack in which a human being or domestic animal has been injured and required medical care from a physician or veterinarian, the director may, after considering all mitigating factors, declare the animal a dangerous dog, and may utilize the procedures set out in section 205.390. The director's determination that the animal is a dangerous dog, may be based on information that the dog in question has been declared a dangerous dog in another city or county when that information is received, in writing, from the individuals responsible for animal control in that city or county and when the criteria for determining the animal a dangerous dog in that city or county are substantially similar to the criteria set forth herein. 
(c)  Regardless of whether the attack is provoked or unprovoked, where a bite occurred on the property of the owner of the dog under review, the director may consider, as a mitigating factor in his decision whether to declare a dog to be dangerous, that the victim of the bite is an animal which intruded onto those premises. Where the victim of a bite which occurs on the premises of the owner is a human, the director may only consider a provoked bite as a mitigating factor in his decision whether to declare a dog to be dangerous. 
(d)  If the director finds any record of one such prior incident, including any one such prior incident in another city or county, the director shall: 
(1)  Determine whether to declare the dog in question a dangerous dog, after considering any or all of the following factors: 
a.  Whether the dog has killed a domestic animal, livestock or poultry without provocation while off the owner's property; 
b.  Whether the dog's owner owns or harbors the dog primarily or in part for dog fighting, or has trained the dog for dog fighting; 
c.  Whether the dog has bitten a human being or domestic animal without provocation and off the premises of the dog's owner regardless of whether medical care was required; 
d.  Whether the dog, while on the owner's premises, has bitten without provocation a human being other than the dog's owner or a member of that owner's family normally residing where the dog is harbored; 
e.  Whether the dog, when unprovoked, has chased or approached a human being off the premises of the dog's owner and in a menacing fashion or apparent attitudes of attack, regardless of whether the human being is injured by the dog; 
f.  Whether the dog has a known propensity, tendency or disposition to make unprovoked attacks, to cause injury, or to otherwise threaten the safety of human beings or domestic animals; 
g.  Whether the dog can be effectively trained or retrained to change its temperament or behavior; 
h.  Whether the owner maintains the dog to promote its aggressive tendencies or responses; 
i.  Any other relevant evidence concerning the maintenance of the dog; and 
j.  Any other relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner to protect the public safety in the future if the dog is permitted to remain in the county. 
(2)  Impound any dog determined to be a dangerous dog at a designated kennel as provided in section 205.360(a); and 
(3)  Spay or neuter any dog determined to be dangerous while that dog is impounded. 
(e)  If the director receives a report that a dog, when unprovoked, has chased or approached a human being or domestic animal while at large and off the premises of the dog's owner and confronted that person in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of attack, regardless of whether the human being or domestic animal is injured by the dog, the director shall give the dog's owner an educational packet prepared by the division concerning dangerous dogs. The director shall record the incident in the department's records and that incident may be taken into account in determining whether the dog is a dangerous dog should there be any subsequent bite of a human or domestic animal. The director may consider information that a dog has, when unprovoked, chased or menaced a human being in another city or county, when that information is received, in writing, from the individuals responsible for animal control in that city or county, in determining whether to provide educational information to the dog's owner. The director may record such information from another city or county into the department's records and may consider such information in determining whether the dog is a dangerous dog should there be any subsequent bite of a human being or domestic animal. 
(f)  If the director finds records of two or more prior incidents in which a dog has bitten a human being or a domestic animal, including incidents occurring in another city or county, where that information is received, in writing, from the individuals responsible for animal control in that city or county, the director shall: 
(1)  Declare the dog a dangerous dog; 
(2)  Impound the dog at a designated kennel as provided in section 205.140(4); and 
(3)  At the end of the dog's impoundment, as provided above, cause the dog to be humanely euthanized pursuant to section 205.390. 
(Code 2008, § 205.480; Ord. No. 3544, § 2, 11-18-2015) 
Sec. 205.390. - Control and euthanization of dangerous dogs. 
(a)  If the director declares that a dog that has bitten a human being or a domestic animal is dangerous, the director shall dispose of the dog as follows: 
(1)  If the director finds that the dog made a severe or fatal attack upon a human being or domestic animal, the director shall cause the dog to be humanely euthanized as set out in subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
(2)  If the director finds that the dog had been provoked to make a severe or fatal attack upon a human being or domestic animal, the director shall either cause the dog to be humanely destroyed or return the dog to its owner subject to the owner's written agreement to control the dog as provided in subsection (b) of this section. The agreement may include a provision that if the animal attacks again, it shall be humanely euthanized. 
(3)  The director has discretion to dispose of all other dogs declared to be dangerous either by causing them to be humanely euthanized or returned to its owner subject to the restrictions as provided in subsection (b) of this section, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard to the dog's owner as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Before the director returns a dangerous dog to its owner, the director shall secure that owner's written agreement to control the dog as provided herein. 
(1)  Any dangerous dog shall wear at all times a bright collar with the words "dangerous dog" embroidered or stamped on the collar so the dog can readily be identified as a dangerous dog. 
(2)  The owner of the dangerous dog shall notify the division of humane services immediately if the dog is loose or missing or has attacked another animal or human being. 
(3)  The owner of the dangerous dog shall notify the division of humane services within 24 hours if the dog has died or has been sold or given away to a new owner. The owner transferring custody to a new owner shall comply with the notice provisions of section 205.370(c). If the dog has been sold or given away, the owner shall provide the division of humane services with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner. The new owner, if the animal is kept within the city, must comply with the requirements in this chapter for keeping a dangerous animal. 
(4)  While on its owner's property, a dangerous dog must be securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen or structure, suitable to prevent the animal from escaping. Such a pen or structure must have a minimum dimension of five feet by ten feet, must have strong, secure sides and a secure top. If it has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than 12 inches. The enclosure must also provide adequate shelter, as defined by this chapter. The enclosure, when occupied by a dangerous dog, shall not be occupied by any other animal, unless the dangerous dog is a female with young less than three months of age, in which case the young may occupy the same enclosure as the mother. 
(5)  No dangerous dog may be kept in any area of the owner's property that would allow the dog to exit easily (e.g., behind screen doors or windows), nor may any dangerous dog be chained without a physical barrier to prevent contact with other animals or people or the escape of the dog. 
(6)  A sign indicating the presence of a dangerous dog shall be present at, and large enough to read from, any public thoroughfare from which the property is entered and the owner of the dog shall post a notice conspicuously visible to the public at each entrance to the premises and on each side of the dog's enclosure, if any, reading in letters not less than two inches high "dangerous dog-beware." A sign with a picture of a growling dog shall also be displayed at all places where the notice of dangerous dog is posted. The sign available from the division of humane services shall be deemed to meet this requirement. Any alternate sign shall be approved in advance, in writing, by the director and a copy of the approved sign shall be maintained in the division's file on the dog. 
(7)  A dangerous dog may be off the owner's premises only if it is securely muzzled with a humane muzzle and on a strong leash no more than four feet long and under the control of the owner. 
(8)  The owner of a dangerous dog shall present to the division of humane services proof that the owner has procured primary liability insurance or a surety bond to include bodily injury and property damage in the amount of at least $300,000.00. Such insurance or surety bond shall be for an initial period of 12 months and must be continuously renewed without a break in coverage for as long as the dangerous dog lives or is kept in the county. The insurance or bond shall be payable to any person injured by the dangerous dog. This policy or bond shall contain a provision requiring the county to be notified by the issuing company at least ten working days prior to any cancellation, termination or expiration of the policy. 
(9)  All owners of dangerous dogs must, within ten days of such declaration, provide the division of humane services with two sets of color photographs of the dangerous dog, one of each side and showing the color and approximate size of the dog.

(10)  All owners of dangerous dogs must, within ten days of such declaration, have the dog spayed or neutered and must provide evidence of such spaying or neutering from a duly licensed veterinarian. 
(11)  Any dog not controlled as provided in this subsection (b) shall be subject to immediate seizure and impoundment for a minimum of ten days or for the time necessary for the owner to comply with this subsection, whichever is larger. 
(c)  The director shall give owners of dogs declared to be dangerous notice of the director's declaration and intended disposition of the dog, as provided herein. 
(1)  Notice of declaration of dangerous dog and of disposition. Immediately upon determining that a dog is dangerous, and at least ten days prior to any humane euthanasia of any such dog, the division of humane services shall notify the dog's owner, if known, if the owner is unknown or unable to be contacted, of the declaration and of any scheduled euthanasia. The notice shall state the owner's right to request a hearing before the director of the department of public health of any determination made by the director by submitting a written request for hearing to the director of the department of public health's office within five days of receiving the notice. 
(2)  Hearing. Upon timely receipt of the written request submitted pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, the director of the department of public health's office shall schedule a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard, including the owner, individuals possessing knowledge of the characteristics of the dog in question, and any other individuals who may come into contact with the dog if it is not destroyed. After all parties have been heard, the director of the department of public health shall make the final determinations as to whether a dog is a dangerous dog and what its disposition is under the provisions of this chapter. The director of the department of public health's determination and decision is final for all purposes, and there shall be no further administrative relief available. 
(d)  The director may declare a dog to be dangerous because of its prior acts even after its owner has removed it from unincorporated the county. Such a dog may not be returned to the county. 
(e)  Should the director receive from any court of competent jurisdiction a stay of an order of euthanasia on a dog, the dog shall remain impounded in the county animal facility until the court has issued its final order.

Sec. 205.400. - Keeping of dangerous animals. 
(a)  It is unlawful for any person to keep, harbor, possess or allow to be in or upon his premises any dangerous animal as defined in section 205.020, regardless of whether or not the animal is on its owner's property. Mere possession or knowledge of presence of a dangerous animal shall be a violation of this section and will require municipal court appearance. 
(b)  To the extent not inconsistent with section 205.390, animal control officers shall, upon determination that an animal is demonstrating or has recently demonstrated behavior that would classify the animal as a dangerous animal under section 205.020, by the authority of the police chief, take custody of the animal and transport it to the city animal shelter where it shall be held until the municipal court hears the matter for final determination. If, however, the animal is so dangerous, vicious or ferocious that taking custody of the animal would put the officer or others at risk of attack and injury, then the officer shall, in good faith with the public safety in mind, destroy the animal on site with no risk of liability. 
(c)  After the animal is impounded, unless the director determines that the animal is dangerous pursuant to the procedures of section 205.390, the municipal court shall determine whether the animal is a dangerous animal in violation of this section based upon evidence and testimony presented by the owner and the city through the prosecuting attorney. The municipal judge may, after finding an animal to be dangerous, order the animal humanely destroyed. In addition, the owner shall bear the expense of the destruction of the animal by the city animal shelter. The city animal shelter shall not place for adoption an animal that is found to be dangerous, vicious or ferocious. 
(d)  If an animal that is dangerous, bites, attacks or otherwise injures a person or other domestic animal, then the owner shall be held responsible either by being charged under state law or if charged under this chapter, shall be punished by no less than a $500.00 fine and, at the discretion of the municipal judge, serve an additional jail sentence of up to 90 days. In the case of any animal, whether previously declared to be dangerous, vicious or ferocious or not, that was found to have committed an unprovoked severe or fatal attack on a human being or another animal, may be ordered humanely destroyed by the municipal judge. In addition, the owner shall bear the expense of the destruction of the animal by the city animal shelter. The city animal shelter shall not place for adoption an animal that is found to be dangerous, vicious or ferocious. 
(e)  Persons who destroy a dangerous animal in defense of themselves, other persons or other domestic animals shall not be held criminally responsible. 
(f)  Owners whose animals attack, bite or injure another party in defense of their owner, other persons or domestic animals shall not be guilty under this section. 
(g)  Dogs owned by governmental or law enforcement agencies when being used in the services of those agencies are exempt from being classified as dangerous.

Sec. 405.200. - "MHD" Mobile Home Development District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the "MHD" district is to provide for and encourage well designed mobile home parks in areas that are adequately served by public water and sewer utilities, promote the development of mobile home parks in a single-family residential neighborhood setting, and to: 
(1)  Bring about mobile home parks that are an asset to the community, and to prevent the development of parks, which would be detrimental to the community. 
(2)  Promote mobile home parks with the character of residential neighborhoods. 
(3)  Protect the health, safety and welfare of mobile home residents and the surrounding community. 
(4)  Harmonize this type of development with other existing or proposed land uses adjacent to the mobile home district. 
(5)  Assure adequate essential public services such as roads, police, drainage, structures, and that the establishment of any mobile home development shall not result in excessive expense in the city for these public services. 
(b)  Permitted uses. 
(1)  Mobile homes, modular homes and manufactured homes. 
(2)  Home occupations as regulated by section 405.460. 
(3)  Pre-school, day care, special or private schools.

Accessory uses for individual mobile home lots permitted are porches or decks within established setback requirements and storage structures as regulated by subsection (d)(3) of this section. 
(c)  General regulations. 
(1)  Minimum development area. The total land area of any mobile home park development shall not be less than ten acres. 
(2)  Plan required. An applicant requesting "MHD" zoning shall submit to the planning and zoning commission a preliminary site development plan drawn by a registered engineer or registered land surveyor. The plan shall depict proposed uses for all lots; access and traffic circulation including entrances, exits, walkways, and off-street parking areas; required buffer zones; the design of common ground and recreational areas including the types of amenities provided; and any additional items set forth herein. 
(3)  Protective screening. A mobile home park shall include a heavily landscaped buffer strip, exclusive of the lot area, around the outer boundary of the development, except where the park is adjacent to an existing mobile home park, that shall be not less than 50 feet in width so as to screen the mobile home park from adjoining properties. The buffer strip shall be of such density as to obscure visible evidence of the development from adjoining property. A landscape plan for the development shall be prepared as a separate document for review and approval by the planning and zoning commission. In addition, a masonry wall or solid fence may be required by the planning commission in such buffer strip. The landscaping depicted shall be considered a binding element of the project and its continued maintenance shall be the developers, his successor or subsequent owner's responsibility. 
(4)  Recreational use area. At least 600 square feet of recreational area shall be provided for each mobile home lot contained within a mobile home park development. This requirement shall be depicted on the preliminary site development plan, and shall be adequately lighted for safety. The recreational area shall provide amenities for park residences. The amount of amenities required by this subsection shall increase as the number of lots increase. Amenities shall be provided based upon the following schedule: 
a.  For zero to 50 lots, a playground area with equipment and a laundry facility shall be provided; 
b.  For 51 to 100 lots, playground areas with equipment, laundry facility and a jogging and bicycle trail shall be provided; 
c.  For 101 and above lots, playground areas with equipment, a laundry facility, jogging and bicycle trails, swimming pool and a clubhouse shall be provided; 
Alternative amenities proposed by the applicant shall be reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(5)  Mobile home park access and interior circulation. Access to a mobile home park or subdivision shall be from a collector or arterial streets. No individual mobile home lot shall have direct access to a street outside of the boundaries of the mobile home park and all lots shall front on a street within the development. Interior access drives shall be properly lighted and shall be constructed in compliance with the standards of the subdivision regulations. Installations to discourage speeding through the park shall be approved by the public works department. Sidewalks shall be required, not less than four feet in width on both sides of all streets in the development. 
(6)  Mobile home park expansion. No existing mobile home park shall be enlarged or extended when such park does not meet the applicable health or safety requirements, or when such park is in violation of the regulations and standards regarding sewage treatment or discharge, pollution or water quality. No existing park on the date of adoption or amendment to this chapter shall be enlarged or extended without conforming to these zoning regulations. (See article VIII of this chapter for additional requirements.) 
(7)  Permanent foundation required. All mobile homes parked, located or erected within an approved mobile home development shall be placed upon a permanent foundation, as defined by this chapter, forming a complete closure beneath exterior walls. For the purpose of this chapter, placement of a mobile home upon uniform jack or blocks upon a concrete pad, skirted with sheet metal, aluminum, wood, or other temporary material, and secured by tie downs, shall not be considered a permanent foundation meeting this requirement. 
(8)  Park maintenance. Park owners or homeowners' associations are required to maintain the physical, recreational, natural facilities and features of the park in a neat and orderly and safe condition. 
(9)  Application of regulations. In their interpretation and application, this section shall be considered as minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. However, recognizing the premanufactured nature of mobile home units, it is recognized that lots exceeding the minimum yard and area requirements of this section may be required to accommodate some units, and that suitable provisions shall be made by developers to provide for such units. Based upon this guideline, not providing for such minimum provisions shall not be considered an adequate basis for the granting of a variance from such requirements. Further, it is the express intent of this section to encourage and promote mobile home park developments similar in nature and recognizable as single-family residential neighborhoods. 
(10)  Orientation. All mobile homes within the mobile home development shall be placed upon their individual lots in such a fashion that the long axis of the mobile home shall face, and be parallel to, the principal street frontage giving access to the lot. In the case of corner lots the mobile home may face either street frontage. In the case of any double frontage lots, the mobile home shall face, and access shall be restricted to, the minor street and shall not be permitted on collector or arterial streets.

Sec. 405.270. - "PD" Planned Development District. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. 
(1)  The purpose of the planned development district is to provide a means of achieving a greater flexibility in development of land in a manner not possible in conventional zones; to encourage more imaginative and innovative design of projects; to promote a more desirable community environment; to embrace, promote, preserve and enhance the public and private urban forest; and to retain maximum control over both the structure and future operation of the development. The planned development district serves to preserve existing natural features, scenic qualities or existing open and wooded spaces and adapt the development to existing land features. 
(2)  The board of aldermen, upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, may, by ordinance adopted in the same manner as zoning districts are created, authorize a planned development district when the proposed development or use of a specific tract of land or area warrants greater flexibility, control and density than would otherwise be possible under the general regulations which do not permit excessive densities, or the development of incompatible land uses, either within a development, or as the development relates to the general neighborhood. 
(3)  The city may, upon proper application, approve a planned development using flexible techniques of land development and site design to gain relief from zoning requirements in relation to lot size, dwelling size and property line setbacks, designed for conventional developments; provided, however, that the application shall not conflict with, or result in encroachment upon, any standard of chapter 410, and shall only be approved upon demonstration of achievement of one or more of the following objectives: 
a.  Environmental design in the development of land that is of a higher quality than is possible under the regulations otherwise applicable to the property. 
b.  Diversification in the uses permitted and variation of the relationship of uses, structures, open space and height of structures in developments intended as cohesive, unified projects. 
c.  Functional and beneficial uses of open space areas and preservation and protection of natural features of a development site, inclusive of preservation, planting, maintenance, restoration, protection and survival of desirable tree canopy areas within a development site. 
d.  Establishment and maintenance of the neighborhood concept by allowing non-residential uses within the development, thereby discouraging strip commercial development. 
e.  Creation of a safe and desirable living environment for residential areas characterized by a unified building and site development program. 
f.  Rational and cost effective development in relation to public services and public and private infrastructure installation and maintenance by reducing the distance utilities are extended and installed or reducing width and length of streets, except that no easement encroachments shall be permitted as a result of the review and processing of any preliminary or final development plan required by this section. 
g.  Efficient and effective traffic circulation, both within and adjacent to the development site, and the encouragement of pedestrian and non-motorized pathway utilizing site features, compliant with the trail master plan or land use plan, and thus establishing performance standards that ensure sidewalks and trails are not impeded by motor vehicles associated with the development. 
h.  To decrease or minimize non-point source pollution impacts by reducing the amount of impervious surfaces in site development. 
(b)  Relationship of planned development districts to zoning. 
(1)  Mapped district. The "PD" designation is not intended to be attached to existing use districts as an overlay. The "PD" designation as detailed in this section is a separate use district and may be attached to a parcel of land as an original zoning district, or it may be attached to a parcel of land through the process of zoning map amendment (rezoning). A zoning map amendment to achieve the "PD" designation shall comply with the requirements and procedures of article X of this chapter, including those for public hearings. If a property is zoned agricultural within the city and greater density is requested based upon the city's comprehensive plan, an application for zoning district amendment under the procedures of article X of this chapter is required to establish a residential zoning district classification and residential density. 
(2)  Plan approval required. Although the "PD" designation may be applied to parcels of land as a mapped zoning district, it is the intent of this section that no development or redevelopment of property represented by the "PD" designation take place until an acceptable preliminary and final development plan has been reviewed and approved in conformance with the requirements of this section. A planned development will involve subdivision of land; therefore, the subdivision review and approval procedures contained in chapter 410 shall be administered. Any pre-existing uses within the area encompassed by the "PD" designation shall have the status of non-conforming uses, as outlined in article VI of this chapter, until such time as they are included in an approved development plan. 
(3)  Types of planned developments. All areas of the city subject to the "PD" designation shall be assigned one of the following subclassifications that shall be considered a separate use district and be subject to the specific restrictions and limitations outlined in this section: 
a.  Planned Development-Residential ("PD-R"). Planned developments involving residential uses only. 
b.  Planned Development-Commercial ("PD-C"). Planned developments involving commercial uses only. 
c.  Planned Development-Industrial ("PD-I"). Planned developments involving industrial uses only. 
d.  Planned Development Mixed Use ("PD-MXD"). Planned developments involving a mixture of residential and non-residential uses. 
(4)  Approved planned districts. Approved or properly executed planned developments existing at the time of adoption of these regulations will be subject to the restrictions of the final development plan approved by the city and will not be required to comply with these regulations. 
(c)  Overall development site size. 
(1)  The minimum overall site size required for planned developments shall be as follows: 
a.  Planned Development-Residential: 10.0 acres. 
b.  Planned Development-Commercial: 1.0 acre. 
c.  Planned Development-Industrial: 2.0 acres. 
d.  Planned Development-Mixed Use: 30.0 acres. 
(2)  These minimum site sizes may be waived by the board of aldermen upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission if a specific proposal has severe limitations regarding topography, tree cover, wetlands, floodplains, soil conditions, utility easements, or unusual land shape or proportions for conventional development; or if it is determined that the use proposed is desirable or necessary in relationship to the surrounding neighborhood; or if the board of aldermen determines such waiver to be in the general public interest. 
(d)  Permitted uses. The use of land is considered an integral element of the proposed development plan. Approval of the proposed development by the board of aldermen carries with it approval of the various uses encompassed by it. Based upon this relationship, the planning and zoning commission and the board of aldermen may require revisions to the proposed development plan as it relates to the proposed uses; or may require elimination from the plan of any use considered inappropriate, based upon its relationship to other uses proposed in the plan, surrounding existing land uses, land uses featured in the comprehensive plan for the city or other factors demonstrating that, based on sound planning principles, the use is not compatible or appropriate in the area proposed. Uses of land shall be established by the ordinance adopted by the board of aldermen authorizing the "PD" planned development district. Uses of land, which may be proposed within a development plan, by "PD" subclassification are as follows: 
Subclassification Requirement Planned Development-Residential Uses may include only those uses designated as permitted, accessory or conditional uses in the "R-1A" through "R-1E" Single-Family Districts, "R-2" Two-Family District and "R-3" Multi-Family District. Planned Development-Commercial Uses may include only those uses designated as permitted or conditional uses in the "C-O" Office District, "C-1," "C-2" and "C-3" Commercial Districts, or other uses of commercial nature, but excluding residential uses. Planned Development-Industrial Uses may include those uses designated as permitted or conditional uses in the "C-O" Office District, "I-1" or "I-2" Industrial Districts, but excluding residential uses. Planned Development-Mixed Use Uses may include those uses designated as permitted, accessory or conditional uses in any of the districts.  
Regardless of the classification of the use in the underlying district (i.e., permitted, accessory or conditional), such use as a part of any proposed "PD" or amendment thereto shall be approved only through the "PD" process set forth in this section. 
(e)  Density and area regulations and performance standards. 
(1)  General standards. Approval of the preliminary development plan may provide for regular exceptions from traditional zoning districts as may be necessary or desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed planned development; provided, however, such exceptions must be consistent with the standards and criteria contained in this section and have been specifically requested in the application for a planned development; and further, that no modification of the regulations contained herein would be allowed with the following results: 
a.  Inadequate or unsafe motor vehicle or pedestrian access, or inadequate utility access within the planned development; 
b.  Traffic volumes exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity; 
c.  Undue burden on public parks, recreation areas, schools, fire and police protection, and other public facilities which serve, or are proposed to serve, the planned development; 
d.  Development which will be incompatible with the general purposes of this chapter; or 
e.  Detrimental environmental or aesthetic impact on the surrounding area, or individual lot area, by coverage of structures to achieve adequate sunlight, air and storm water conveyance. 
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to clearly demonstrate that the above criteria are being met. The burden of proof shall rest with the developer and not city staff or the planning and zoning commission. 
(2)  Designation of open space. 
a.  A minimum of ten percent of the total project area shall be dedicated as common open space, unless clustering is utilized (see subsection (e)(3) of this section). Pre-developed slopes of 40 percent or more shall be preserved as common open space, excluding areas used in conjunction with subdivision plan street layout and design. Floodplain or floodway areas shall be designated as common open space utilized for recreational or open space amenities. Impact on these areas is permissive upon application and preliminary and final plan approval for portions of residential lot development. Amenities such as trails, swimming pools, clubhouses, playgrounds, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts or other fixed structures will be considered, but are not required for the approval of a planned development district and the city shall give positive consideration to a preliminary development plan that preserves green space and trees, above that that is undevelopable. 
b.  Common open space shall be used for the collective enjoyment of the occupants of the development or for the general public if so dedicated. Common open space shall be distributed equally throughout the development as practicable and be highly accessible to the dwelling units it is intended to serve and shall not be isolated to areas of unusable land. 
c.  No area of interior project common open space in the development plan shall be less than ten feet in width in its smallest dimension. 
d.  The use, operation and maintenance of the common open space areas and common ground buildings shall be guaranteed through establishment of a trust indenture represented by an association or trustees. 
(3)  Clustering design standards. 
a.  Purpose. As an alternative to the density and open space requirements of subsections (e)(1) and (2) of this section, a developer may choose to cluster or group the structures of an entire development or on a portion of an overall development so as to preserve a significant amount of the site as protected open or wooded space, recreation areas or common area. If the proposed development is within the medium density residential land use category and the developer chooses to have a portion of the development as a cluster, the area to be clustered shall meet the minimum open space requirements as set forth in the clustering design standards, while the gross open space for the entire development shall be a minimum of 35 percent. The city encourages developers to investigate the clustering approach as it often can reduce the cost of development by reducing the amount of streets, utilities and other improvements while simultaneously benefitting the environment by reducing impervious surface, stormwater runoff, protecting woodlands and otherwise preserving natural or other beneficial features and functions of the land. 
b.  Minimum required open space. Minimum required open space for a cluster development (based upon city comprehensive land use map): 
Land Use Category Minimum Required Open Space Low density residential 60% Medium density residential 40%  
c.  Application. All applications for a cluster development shall be filed with the planning and zoning department and shall be identified as a cluster development subdivision. In addition to the requirements of subsection (f)(2) of this section, the application shall include a statement verifying that the applicant submission of a proposed cluster development complies with the intent of this section as stated in subsection (a) of this section and the applicant shall provide an 11-inch by 17-inch aerial image of the proposed development tract off of an aerial source not dated in excess of three years and a preliminary plat under standards of this Code, specifically section 410.110. 
d.  Common ground and dedicated land. Common ground and land dedications, to be included in the gross acreage of the development for density calculations, shall have the following permitted uses: 
1.  Conservation of open space in its natural state. 
2.  Recreation amenities and their accessory structures, including, but not limited to, trails, picnic areas, community gardens, playing fields, playground and multi-use courts or uses similar in nature. 
3.  Parking areas to serve recreational facilities. 
(4)  Perimeter buffer requirements. 
a.  Where a "PD-R" development proposes residential development along the perimeter of the site, that is of higher density than the adjacent residential district, the board of aldermen has created a minimum of a 20-foot-wide buffer area. The buffer area shall be free of buildings, structures or impervious surfaces and shall be permanent and landscaped, or preserved with natural features, so that the higher density residential development is visually screened from the lower density development. 
b.  All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy, well-maintained condition. 
(5)  Development phasing. If construction of the development is to occur in stages, then open space or recreational amenities should be developed in reasonable proportion to the number of dwelling units intended to be developed and to be served during any given stage of construction as approved on the final development plat by the board of aldermen. 
(6)  Elevations required. For all "PD" developments, the applicant shall present to the city illustrations or colored elevations of proposed buildings within the development, provided the applicant may submit to the city for review buildings with different elevations than those adopted by the approving ordinance, approval of that are contingent upon the revised buildings being of similar materials and the new elevations being substantially compliant with amounts of exterior features shown on the previously submitted elevations. 
(7)  Use of professional consultants. In review of a preliminary or final development plan for approval, the planning commission or the board of aldermen may elect to utilize qualified technical personnel or professional consultants to provide traffic impact analysis, stormwater and erosion control, if applicable, based upon unique circumstances in excess of standard review or similar studies related to the proposed development. The cost of such professional assistance shall be borne by the applicant. 
(8)  Non-residential development. Non-residential uses permitted in the "PD" Planned Development District shall be subject to all the requirements for lot area, width, height, yards and setbacks of the district in which it was permitted unless modified by the ordinance adopted by the board of aldermen authorizing the planned development. 
(9)  Planned Development-Residential. 
a.  Residential density. The purpose of a planned development is to allow modifications to development standards which cannot be achieved in conventional zoning districts. Proposed housing may be clustered and grouped to achieve or preserve open space and other amenities. The density of residential development shall be based upon the density limits of the existing residential districts. In no case shall the housing density exceed the limits of that permitted for the total site based upon the mapped residential districts, except as illustrated in subsection (e)(9)b of this section. 
b.  Density bonus. 
1.  The board of aldermen may approve an increase in the allowable density within a "PD-R" district, upon dedication of land or equivalent cash contribution, under the specific guidelines listed, for the land acquisition, development or maintenance of a park site. The density bonus shall be calculated on the basis of the net development area, which excludes required right-of-way and required open space. 
2.  Based upon the requested underlying zoning district, for every acre dedicated the development rights (residential density) for that acre can be transferred and provided upon another acre or spread throughout the net development area. For that same acre received in dedication, an applicant may be entitled to receive an additional one-half of the allowable density for each acre dedicated. This additional density may be provided elsewhere or spread throughout the net development area. 
3.  If a density bonus is requested, the applicant shall document all site amenities, improvements and location of additional lots for the city's review and consideration. 
4.  If a density bonus is requested through the dedication of land, the board of aldermen shall review the size and scope of the dedication and determine if the dedication fulfills the recreational needs of city residents. 
5.  When a density bonus is requested, and where the city determines that the recreational needs of the residents of a proposed development or area of the city would be better served through the development of land outside of a proposed project boundary, or where a "PD" Planned Development District is too small to include an adequate park site or available land is inappropriate for recreational uses, the subdivider or developer may pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication. The cash contribution in lieu of park land dedication shall be held by the city in a special fund and dispersed for the acquisition and development of park land for the benefit of the future or current residents of such subdivision. The cash contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be to the average acquisition cost per acre of the development, plus an inflation factor based on a consumer price index for real estate from the date of purchase, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park land. 
6.  All lands dedicated shall be free from any liens or encumbrances. Depiction of property, dedicated as permanent open space or recreational use on the final development plan, shall guarantee the land remain permanently used for open space.

    Unless otherwise stated, the regulations hereafter established shall apply to all districts established by this chapter. These general regulations supplement and qualify the district regulations appearing elsewhere in this chapter. 
(Code 2006, § 405.175; Code 2008, § 405.175; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1684, § 6, 8-23-2000) 
Sec. 405.350. - Land and buildings. 
(a)  Number of buildings permitted per lot. 
(1)  Every single-family dwelling hereafter erected, or structurally altered shall be located on a separate lot or tract. In no case shall there be more than one detached single-family dwelling on one lot or tract (except for accessory buildings or uses). 
(2)  No accessory land use or development shall be established until a primary structure or use is established on the same lot. No accessory land use or development shall be allowed to continue after termination of the primary use or development on a lot. 
(3)  In the event two or more permitted, conditional or accessory uses are conducted on the same tract of land, each having different minimum area requirements, the minimum area regulations for the combined uses shall be the largest of the required minimum areas for each of the particular uses. 
(b)  Approved lots. Every building or complex of buildings erected or structurally altered after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be located on a lot that meets the requirements of this chapter and subdivision regulations. The open space requirements for the district in which each lot is located must likewise be met. 
(c)  Minimum lot size. Land dedicated for street right-of-way shall not be included in computing minimum lot area for the purposes of this chapter. However, if through dedication of street right-of-way, the area of any lot or parcel already established via the provisions of the land use and subdivision regulations is decreased below the minimum area required in the applicable zoning district, development rights shall not be denied. 
(d)  Right-of-way acquisitions. If any legal lot of record, because of the acquisition of right-of-way by the city or other governmental entity, is caused to fall below the minimum applicable setback, lot width, lot coverage or open space requirement established by the lot's zoning district, the lot shall not be considered a non-conforming lot and the minimum setback, lot width, lot coverage or open space requirements for that lot, if less than the applicable minimum standards, shall be those of the lot after such right-of-way acquisition. Any building or structure on such lot that, prior to the city's acquisition of right-of-way, would have been permitted to be expanded under the applicable setback, lot width, lot coverage or open space requirement may still be expanded or enlarged so long as the deviation from the requirement does not exceed 25 percent of the regulation or regulations in question.

(a)  Commercial/industrial front yards. In districts "C-O" to "I-2" inclusive, where buildings located in the same block on the same side of a street have provided front yards of greater depth than herein required, the planning and zoning commission may require a similar or average setback for buildings or structures constructed thereafter. 
(b)  Determination of setbacks. In measuring a yard, the minimum horizontal distance between the proposed right-of-way line and the main building shall be used. The required setback line shall be measured from the proposed right-of-way line, that shall be determined by the community development director. Minimum setbacks shall be enforced from proposed right-of-way line as identified by the adopted comprehensive plan. The required width of the street in question shall be determined by the community development director, based upon the transportation chapter of the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Structural projections. Every part of a required yard shall be open from its lowest point to the sky unobstructed, except for the ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, chimneys, buttresses, ornamental features, bayed areas (such as bay windows, doors and other interior space, with or without usable floor space), and roof eaves; provided, however, that none of the above projections shall extend into a minimum yard more than 24 inches or as otherwise provided for in this chapter; and provided further that outside stairways, balconies, canopies, fire escapes or open porches may project a maximum of six feet into the required front or rear yard, and shall not be enclosed; and provided further that no dwelling unit shall have a bayed area that exceeds 20 square feet in area or that encroaches into an easement. Mechanical units are specifically excluded from this exception as it applies to front and side yard areas, whether attached or detached. For structures other than single-family, single-family attached and two-family dwellings, outside stairways, fire escapes and balconies may project into a required side yard not more than half the width of such yard, but not more than six feet from the building. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, no projection allowed hereunder shall project or extend into a side yard more than five feet from any side yard property line. 
(d)  Rear yard setback. For single-family and two-family dwellings, the rear yard setback on irregular shaped corner lots shall be determined by the community development director. In no case shall the rear setback be less than 20 feet unless further adjusted by approval of an appeal to the board of adjustment. In addition, the rear setback on triangular shaped lots shall be determined by measuring the required distance on both side lines from the point of intersection. 
(e)  Accessory buildings and structures. See section 405.410. 
(f)  Sight triangle. On a corner lot in any district, new residential, commercial and industrial developments shall conform to the requirements of the sight triangle in which nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of two feet and eight feet above the grades at the back of the curb of the intersecting streets, within the triangular area formed by the right-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points 30 feet from their point of intersection or at equivalent points on private streets, except that the site triangle shall be increased for certain uses when deemed necessary for traffic safety by the community development director. 
(g)  Commercial/industrial rear yards. In districts "C-2" to "I-2" inclusive, if the rear line adjoins a railway right-of-way or has a rear railway track connection, no rear yard shall be required. Proposed development shall conform to all other area standards within the district located. 
(h)  Uncovered slabs. Uncovered slab type porches or paved terraces and patios having a maximum height of not more than 12 inches above ground elevation at any point may project into any yard except that the projection into the front yard shall not exceed ten feet.

(a)  Maximum lot coverage calculation. In computing the amount of residential lot coverage, the amount of coverage shall include the total area of all principal and accessory buildings, including decks and above ground pools, as measured along the outside wall at ground level or as viewed from above and includes all projections other than open, unroofed porches, fire escapes, or a roof overhang. Roads, driveways, parking lots, patios and inground swimming pools shall not be included in maximum lot coverage requirements. 
(b)  Corner lots. Where a lot in any zoning district is located at the intersection of two or more streets, the front yard setback required by that zoning district shall be provided on each street frontage regardless of the orientation of the building upon the lot, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. In those instances where rear yard setback exceeds the front yard setback in depths for the applicable zoning district, it shall be substituted for the front yard setback where the orientation of the building upon the lot makes its use appropriate. 
(Code 2006, § 405.195; Code 2008, § 405.195; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1684, § 6, 8-23-2000)

Notwithstanding the above, the city may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the city finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the city and its citizens and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. 
d.  Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the city may disapprove an application for any of the following reasons: 
1.  Conflict with safety and building codes; 
2.  The use or construction of wireless communications facilities that is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use designation; 
3.  The placement and location of wireless communications facilities which would create a risk to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community; 
4.  Conflicts with this section. 
(5)  Height. Height of a tower approved by CUP shall be reviewed through the application procedure and shall be approved by the board of aldermen upon receipt of a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. No tower shall be approved at a height exceeding 125 feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the proper function of the applicant's system or that of a public safety communications system of a governmental entity sharing the tower. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a telecommunications consultant hired by the city at the expense of the applicant. The opinion of the consultant shall include a statement that no available alternatives exist to exceeding the height limit, including, but not limited to, the use of two or more support structures, and the reason why such alternatives are not viable. 
(6)  Scope of review. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the following factors in addition to the factors listed above as well as factors listed in article XIII of this chapter in determining a recommendation on an application for a conditional use permit for a telecommunication tower: 
a.  Height of the proposed wireless communications facilities; 
b.  Proximity of the wireless communications facilities to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
c.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
d.  Surrounding topography; 
e.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
f.  Design of the wireless communications facilities, with particular attention paid to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
g.  Availability of suitable existing support structures and other structures which may negate the need for a proposed wireless communication facility, considering: 
1.  Height; 
2.  Structural strength; 
3.  Resulting signal interference; 
4.  Feasibility of retrofitting; 
5.  Feasibility of redesigning the applicant's network; or 
6.  Other limiting conditions that render support structures, or other structures or buildings within the applicant's required geographic area unsuitable; 
h.  The design of the wireless communications facilities, including ground layout, maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with provisions and intent of this section; 
i.  The proposal minimizes the number or height and visibility of support structures that will be required in the area. Where alternate technology or design exists or is reasonably available that would satisfy the general need for the proposal, this factor is ordinarily not satisfied; 
j.  The applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of reasonably available shared use opportunities or procedures provided by this section or otherwise; 
k.  That no land owned by any agency of the federal or state government, or by any political subdivision of the state, is available for locating the wireless communications facility. 
(7)  Performance guarantee. Upon final approval of the conditional use permit, the applicant shall deposit with the community development department a bond, or other form of security acceptable to the city as to type of security and the form and manner of execution in an amount to insure performance of certain obligations of the applicant to make improvements shown upon the approved plan or attested to in any of the accompanying documents pursuant to section 405.900. Improvements that are to be guaranteed by escrow are as follows, but shall not be limited to: required fencing, landscaping, and access roads/public roadway extensions. 
(8)  RF engineer certification required; additional studies. The city may require, at the expense of the applicant, any additional studies or the hiring of an external consultant, including technical and legal services, to review exhibits or other requirements in accordance with this section. Applications for a new tower shall be considered only after a letter, certified by a radio frequency engineer under oath, stating that the planned telecommunication equipment cannot be accommodated on an existing or already approved support structure that is capable of shared use and providing facts including: 
a.  All alternatives considered; and 
b.  Precise cost estimates where cost is a basis for the determination clearly demonstrating one or more of the following conditions: 
1.  Planned telecommunications equipment would exceed the structural capacity of an existing or approved support structure, and the support structure cannot be reinforced to accommodate planned telecommunication equipment at a reasonable cost; 
2.  Planned telecommunications equipment will cause radio frequency interference with other existing or planned telecommunications equipment for that support structure and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost; 
3.  Existing or approved support structures do not have space on which the planned telecommunications equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and at least in parity with other similar telecommunications equipment in place or approved by the city or other area jurisdictions; or 
4.  Other reasons that make it impractical and not feasible to place the telecommunications equipment planned by the applicant on an existing or approved support structure. 
(h)  Removal of obsolete towers. Any tower that is no longer in use for commercial communication purposes shall be removed at the owner's expense. The owner shall provide the city with a copy of the notice to the FCC of the intent to cease operations and shall be given 90 days from the date of ceasing operations to remove the obsolete tower and accessory structures. In the case of multiple operators sharing use of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations. The equipment on the ground is not to be removed, however, until the tower structure has first been dismantled and removed. 
(i)  Default and/or revocation. If a wireless telecommunications facility is repaired, rebuilt, moved, relocated, modified or maintained in a way that is inconsistent or not in compliance with this section or of the conditional use permit, then the city shall notify the holder of the applicable permit in writing of such violation. A permit holder in violation may be considered in default and subject to fines as in article IX of this chapter and if a violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the city in a reasonable period of time, the permit is subject to revocation. 
(j)  Commercial operation of unlawful wireless communications facilities. Notwithstanding any right that may exist for a governmental entity to operate or construct wireless communications facilities, it is unlawful for any person to erect or operate for any private commercial purpose any wireless communications facilities in violation of any provision of this section, regardless of whether such wireless communications facilities are located on land owned by a governmental entity.

(b)  Supplementary regulations. Every public utility, cable company, video service provider and other users of the city rights-of-way or adjacent easements or property to provide services shall comply with the supplemental regulations in this section regarding the placement of accessory utility facilities on public or private property. For purposes of this section, the term "accessory utility facilities" means such non-city facilities, including pedestals, boxes, vaults, cabinets, or other ground-mounted or below ground facilities that directly serve the property or local area in which the facility is placed, are not primarily for transmission or distribution to other locations, do not materially alter the character of the neighborhood or area, and otherwise are customarily found in such areas. Except where limited by other provisions of city ordinance, accessory utility facilities shall be subject to the following supplementary regulations: 
(1)  Approval; design; location; application. The design, location, and nature of all accessory utility facilities on private or public property shall require approval of the city, which approval shall be considered in a non-discriminatory manner, in conformance with this section, and subject to reasonable permit conditions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this section. In considering applications, individual or multiple location applications, the city shall review the request to ensure the proposed facilities do not impair public safety, harm property values or significant sight lines (see section 405.380(f)) or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining properties or neighborhood, and taking into consideration reasonable alternatives. Any material changes or extensions to such facilities or the construction of any additional structures shall be subject to the requirements and approvals as set forth herein. Unless otherwise prohibited, utility facilities subject to this subsection may be located in minimum setback areas, provided that all other requirements are met. To the extent permitted by RSMo 67.2707 (3), the time, method, manner or location of facilities to be located in the rights-of-way may be established or conditioned by the city to protect the rights-of-way or to ensure public safety. An inspection fee may be required as established by the city to reimburse the city for the costs of review and inspection of accessory utility facilities as may be permitted by applicable law. 
(2)  General regulations. The following general regulations apply to all accessory utility facilities: 
a.  All such facilities shall be placed underground, except for good cause shown or except as otherwise provided in subsections (b)(2)d and (b)(2)e of this section or as approved by conditional use permit. 
b.  All such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise. 
c.  All facilities and utility boxes shall be deemed abandoned after six continuous months of non-use, and shall therefore be removed within 30 days thereafter at the cost of the utility. 
d.  Unless good cause is shown and unless otherwise restricted, utility poles for authorized above ground lines or facilities shall be permitted up to 55 feet along arterial roads and 45 feet in height elsewhere where utilities are not otherwise required to be placed underground; provided that such poles shall be no higher than necessary, maintained so as to avoid leaning from upright position, and without use of guy wires crossing rights-of-way or pedestrian routes except where approved by the city as necessary due to the lack of feasible alternatives. 
e.  Utility facilities placed in designated historic areas may be subject to additional requirements regarding the placement and appearance of facilities as may be necessary to reasonably avoid or reduce any negative impact of such placement. 
f.  Any damage to landscaping or vegetation on private or public property during installation or maintenance of facilities shall be promptly remedied by the facility owner. 
g.  At least 48 hours prior to any installation, replacement or expansion of any facility located on private property, the facility owner shall provide notice to all property owners within 185 feet from the site. Notice shall include detailed description of work to be done, the exact location of work and the time and duration when it will be undertaken. 
h.  No facilities may be located so as to interfere, or be likely to interfere, with any public facilities or use of public property. 
i.  All such facilities proposed to be located within any zone designated for historic preservation shall be required to obtain site plan approval in accordance with the provisions of such zone. 
j.  All utility facilities not authorized by this section as an accessory use or specifically addressed elsewhere in this Code shall be authorized only as a conditional use permit or "PD" Planned Development District. 
(3)  Residential districts. In residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto, accessory utility facilities less than 31/2 feet in height and covering less than eight square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the city. Except as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger utility facility shall be installed underground or authorized to be installed above ground only by conditional use permit. All above ground facilities, where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical. If locating these facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public right-of-way unless otherwise approved by the city upon a determination that all other alternatives are not feasible. 
(4)  Non-residential districts. In non-residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto, accessory utility facilities with a height of less than five feet and covering less than 16 square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the city. Except as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger utility facility shall be installed underground or authorized to be installed above ground only by conditional use permit. All above ground facilities, where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical. If locating these facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public right-of-way unless otherwise approved by the city upon a determination that all other alternatives are not feasible. 
(5)  Landscape screening. A sight-proof landscape screen shall be provided for all authorized above ground facilities taller than three feet in height or covering in excess of four square feet in size, unless waived for good cause pursuant to a site plan approval. Such screen shall be required to sufficiently conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be submitted by the utility and approved by the city prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening. The utility shall be responsible for the installation, repair, or replacement of screening materials. Alternative screening or concealment may be approved by the city to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements. Facilities located in rear yards may be exempted from screening where located so as not to be visible from: 
a.  Any public property; and 
b.  More than two residential dwelling units. 
(6)  Compliance with other laws. All accessory utility facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as part of this Code, including, but not limited to, building codes, zoning requirements and rights-of-way management regulations in addition to the supplementary regulations herein. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any circumstance or entity in which application under such circumstances is pre-empted or otherwise precluded by superseding law.

Sec. 405.470. - Group homes; all residential districts. 
    The city has determined that it is necessary and desirable to provide suitable sites for group homes in residential areas while, in furtherance of the recognized goals of deinstitutionalization and dispersal, ensuring that group homes are not unduly concentrated in neighborhoods so as to afford mentally or physically disabled persons every opportunity to be integrated in the community. To that end, group homes in residential districts shall comply with the following: 
(1)  To promote deinstitutionalization and dispersal, no group home may: 
a.  Be located within 500 feet of another group home, measured by the straight line distance between the nearest points of the exterior walls (exclusive of overhangs) of the buildings within which the relevant facilities or uses are located; 
b.  Adjoin any lot upon which another group home already exists; or 
c.  Be separated from any lot upon which an existing group home already exists only by a street or roadway. 
(2)  The exterior appearance of the home and property, occupancy limitation, signage and other standards applicable to single-family dwellings shall apply equally to group homes.

(4)  All accessory parking lots shall be located on property permitted by zoning. 
(j)  Changes in use. No off-street parking space required under this chapter shall be used for any other purpose. Where a change in use creates greater parking requirements than the amount being provided, an occupancy permit shall not be issued until provision is made for the increased amount of required off-street parking. 
(k)  Additions to structures, buildings or uses. Where an addition is made to an existing structure, building or use which does not comply with the parking requirements cited for such structure, building or use, the parking requirements supplied for the addition shall include those spaces necessary to bring the structure, building or use as a whole into conformance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(l)  Existing parking. No parking area or parking space which exists at the time the ordinance from which this chapter is derived becomes effective (July 26, 1990) or which subsequent thereto is provided for complying with the provisions of this chapter shall thereafter be relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements established by this chapter. 
(m)  Maintenance of parking facilities. Any persons operating or owning a parking lot shall keep it free, as may be practical, of dust, loose particles, trash, debris and broken glass and shall promptly remove the snow and ice from the surface of the parking lot.

(n)  Shared parking. Notwithstanding the parking requirements set out in section 405.580, the number of parking spaces may be reduced by up to 20 percent, at the discretion of the planning commission, if the developer demonstrates that the parking required is so located and designed such that shared parking within the proposed development meets the minimum requirements of this article. A reduction in required parking shall not be permitted in those instances where the planning commission determines that there is a potential for changes in use, over the short term, creating a change in the basic mixture of uses upon which the justification for shared parking is based. Adequate data shall be provided upon the site development plan relating to the request. For the purposes of this section, the city may require a professionally prepared survey, conducted under replicable conditions, which yield a statistically significant result. 
(o)  Parking of vehicles for sale. Vehicles for sale shall be parked only at facilities approved for vehicle sales. Vehicles for sale may be parked in other commercial areas for a maximum of 12 hours or the regular duration of the operator's working shift and only when the vehicle is used for transportation purposes to that commercial destination.

No person, firm, corporation or partnership shall drive through, park, or conduct any activity from a pickup truck rated more than one ton, van, semi-tractor, or commercial vehicle upon any street, highway or roadway within a residential area except for local deliveries. The term "delivery" means active loading or unloading of the vehicle or part of the same and shall not exceed two hours. The parking of such vehicles upon any private or public parking lot in any residential area is expressly prohibited without the permission of the property owner or agent for the property owner. The driver of any semi-tractor and trailer is hereby prohibited from allowing any motor or motors that is a part of the semi-tractor or trailer from running while parked in any residential area regardless of location. Any law enforcement officer or the community development director of the city may cause the removal of any vehicle or part thereof from any residential area where found in violation of the requirements of this chapter. Any expense incurred by the removal shall be at the expense of the driver, operator or owner of the towed unit.

ARTICLE VI. - NON-CONFORMING USES 

Sec. 405.610. - Scope of provisions. 
    The provisions of this section shall apply to all non-conforming uses, lands and structures. A non-conforming land use or structure is one which existed lawfully, whether by variance or otherwise, on the date these zoning regulations or any amendment thereto became effective (July 26, 1990) and which fails to conform to one or more of the applicable regulations of the zoning regulations or such amendment thereto. Such non-conformities may be incompatible with and detrimental to permitted land uses and structures in the zoning districts in which they are situated; they inhibit present and future development of nearby properties; and they confer upon their owners and users a position of disadvantage. 
(Code 2006, § 405.285; Code 2008, § 405.285; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1746, § 3, 3-28-2001) 
Sec. 405.620. - Intent. 
    Existing non-conforming uses of land and structures are not to be expanded, enlarged or relocated; however, their continued, lawful existence, within the requirements of this chapter, may be continued subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 2006, § 405.290; Code 2008, § 405.290; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1746, § 3, 3-28-2001) 
Sec. 405.630. - Non-conforming uses of land. 
    Where, on the date of adoption (July 26, 1990) or amendment of this chapter, a lawful use of a parcel or lot (such use not involving any building or structure or upon which parcel or lot a building or structure is accessory to such principal use) exists that is no longer permissible under the provisions of this chapter, such principal use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Enlargement. No such non-conforming use of a parcel or lot shall be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and no additional accessory use, building or structure shall be established thereon. 
(2)  Relocation. No such non-conforming use of a parcel or lot shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of such parcel or lot not so occupied on the date of adoption of this chapter or to a parcel or lot not in conformance with this chapter. 
(3)  Discontinuance. If such non-conforming use of a parcel or lot ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days (except where government action causes such cessation), the subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the regulations and provisions set by this chapter for the district in which such parcel or lot is located. For the purposes of this chapter, cessation of the non-conforming use shall mean no further active use of the property in the principal non-conforming manner. Continued simple ownership or use of the property for some clearly secondary purpose, such as storage, shall not be considered a continuance of the non-conforming use. 
(Code 2006, § 405.295; Code 2008, § 405.295; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1746, § 3, 3-28-2001) 
Sec. 405.640. - Non-conforming buildings and structures. 
    Where, on the date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lawful building or structure exists that could not be built under the regulations of this chapter by reasons of restrictions upon lot area, lot width, lot coverage, height, open spaces, off-street parking, loading spaces and setbacks, or other characteristics, such building or structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Enlargement. Such building or structure may be enlarged, expanded, extended or altered only if the non-conformity is removed and the improvement conforms to the zoning regulations. 
(2)  Destruction. Should any such building or structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Relocation. Should any such building or structure be moved for any reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(Code 2006, § 405.300; Code 2008, § 405.300; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1746, § 3, 3-28-2001) 
Sec. 405.650. - Use of non-conforming buildings and structures. 
    Where, on the date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lawful use of a building or structure exists that is no longer permissible under the regulations of this chapter, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Enlargement. The use of an existing building or structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall not be enlarged, expanded, reconstructed, moved or structurally extended or altered to occupy a greater area of floor space, except in changing the use of such building or structure to a use permitted in the district in which such building or structure is located. 
(2)  Change in use not permitted. An existing non-conforming land use or structure shall not cause further departures from the zoning regulations. Although an existing non-conforming use may continue, except as hereinafter limited, it may not be changed to another use, except a use permitted in the district in which it is situated and provided it complies with the requirements of that district. 
(3)  Discontinuance. When a non-conforming use of a building or structure is discontinued or abandoned for more than 180 consecutive days (except where government action prevents access to the premises), the building or structure shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(Code 2006, § 405.305; Code 2008, § 405.305; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1746, § 3, 3-28-2001) 
Sec. 405.660. - Repairs and maintenance. 
(a)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the restoration of any structure and its use where such structure has been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an extent less than 50 percent of its replacement value (excluding the value of the land, the cost of preparation of the land, and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use) at the time of destruction, provided the restoration of such structure and its use in no way increases any former non-conformity, and provided further that restoration of such structure is begun within six months of such destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion within one year following such destruction. 
(b)  Whenever such structure has been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement value (excluding the value of the land, the cost of preparation of land, and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use) at the time of destruction, as determined by the building official/community development director by any means within the control of the owner to any extent whatsoever, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with all regulations of the district in which such structure is situated. 
(c)  When a structure is determined to be substandard by the proper administrative official of the city under any applicable ordinance of the city and the cost of placing the structure in condition to satisfy the standards under such ordinance shall exceed 50 percent of the reconstruction cost of the entire structure, such non-conforming structure shall not be restored for continuing a non-conforming use. However, none of the restrictions contained in this section shall limit the authority of the board of adjustment to grant relief for reconstruction of a non-conforming structure as provided in this chapter. 
(Code 2006, § 405.310; Code 2008, § 405.310; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1080, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1746, § 3, 3-28-2001; Ord. No. 3177, § 1, 8-24-2011) 
Sec. 405.670. - Change of tenancy or ownership.

Sec. 405.680. - Completion of pending construction and building permits.

Sec. 405.700. - Substandard non-conforming lots of record. 
(a)  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings or structures may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption (July 26, 1990) or amendment of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership as of the date of adoption of this chapter. 
(b)  This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements, not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this chapter, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for this chapter, and no portion of the parcel or lot shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel or lot be made which leaves remaining any parcel or lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.

    Whether a non-conforming use exists is a question of fact and shall be decided by the community development director upon application by the owner or developer of any existing structure or building or use for a certificate of non-conforming use. The burden shall be on the owner or developer to establish an entitlement to continue a non-conformity or to complete a non-conforming development. The community development director shall review all evidence submitted, inspect the structure, building or use that is the subject of the application, and grant or deny the certificate. Within 45 days from the date on which the community development director issues a decision to grant or deny the certificate, the decision of the community development director may be appealed to the board of adjustment that shall hear and decide such an appeal.

ARTICLE VII. - SITE PLAN APPROVAL 

Sec. 405.790. - Purpose. 
(a)  There is a value to the public in establishing safe and convenient traffic movement to all developments including intensely developed sites, both within the site and in relation to access streets; that there is value in encouraging a harmonious relationship of buildings and uses both within a site and in relation to adjacent uses; further that there are benefits to the public in conserving natural resources. Toward this end, this chapter requires site plan review and approval by the planning and zoning commission and the board of aldermen for buildings and structures that can be expected to have a significant impact on natural resources, traffic patterns, adjacent land usage, and the character of future urban development. 
(b)  The site plan is intended to demonstrate to the planning and zoning commission and the board of aldermen the character and objectives of the proposed development in accordance with section 405.820 so that the commission may evaluate the effect the proposed development would have on the community and determine what provisions, if any, should be included as part of the plan and be binding on the use and development of the property.

ARTICLE VIII. - CONDITIONAL USES 

Sec. 405.930. - Purpose. 
(a)  Conditional uses are land uses that are considered by the city to be essentially desirable, necessary or convenient to the community, but by their nature or their operation may generate large amounts of traffic; may attract a large number of persons to the site of the use, thus creating noise or other pollutants; may have a detrimental effect upon the value or potential development of other properties in the neighborhood; or a potential for accidents or danger to public health or safety. These uses require the consideration and exercise of planning judgment on location and site planning. 
(b)  It is hereby declared that certain land uses and developments present unique problems with respect to their proper location and relationship to other land uses. These uses location shall not be in conflict with the comprehensive plan. Therefore, analysis and judgment of the consequences of each development and use is necessary to preserve and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare. Such land uses and developments are identified in each particular zoning district under conditional uses. 
(Code 2006, § 405.445; Code 2008, § 405.445; Ord. No. 1076, §§ 1, 2, 7-26-1990; Ord. No. 1805, § 1, 11-28-2001) 
Sec. 405.940. - Procedures. 
    The request for a conditional use permit may be initiated by a verified application of one or more of the owners of record or owners under contract of a lot or tract of land or their authorized representatives or by the planning and zoning commission or the board of aldermen upon filing of a resolution of intention. Procedures for application, review and approval of a conditional use permit shall be as follows: 
(1)  Application. Application for a conditional use permit for a specific tract of land shall be addressed to the planning and zoning commission and filed with the planning department.

e.  A recent certificate of title or deed to the property indicating ownership. 
f.  A verification by the applicant of the truth and correctness of the contents of the application. 
(2)  Public hearing. All applications shall be subject to a public hearing before the planning and zoning commission. The public hearing shall be held within 45 days of the community development director's receipt of a completed application meeting all application requirements. Any such hearing may, for good cause at the request of the applicant or in the discretion of the commission, be continued. The public hearing requirements shall be the same if a petition for a conditional use permit is initiated by resolution of intention by the planning and zoning commission or the board of aldermen. 
a.  The planning and zoning commission will be responsible for acquiring names of all property owners of record within 300 linear feet of the property for which a conditional use permit has been requested. Such notices will be mailed by the planning and zoning commission prior to the hearing. 
b.  The community development director will placard the property with notice of the public hearing prior to the hearing. 
(3)  Burden of proof. In presenting an application for a conditional use permit, the burden of proof shall rest with the applicant to provide any necessary evidence to clearly indicate that the proposed conditional use shall meet the following criteria: 
a.  The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable provisions of these regulations, including intensity of use regulations, yard regulations and use limitations. 
b.  The proposed conditional use at the specified location will contribute to and promote the welfare or convenience of the public. 
c.  The proposed conditional use will not cause injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located. 
d.  The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations or the city's comprehensive plan. In determining whether the conditional use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to: 
1.  The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences on the site; and 
2.  The nature and extent of proposed landscaping and screening on the site. 
e.  Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the standards set forth in these regulations. 
f.  Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have been or will be provided. 
g.  Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided and shall be so designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets and alleys in conformance with the city's access guidelines in the transportation master plan. 
h.  Adequate provisions for internal traffic and pedestrian traffic are made. 
(4)  Approval or denial of application. 
a.  Subsequent to the aforementioned public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall either recommend that the board of aldermen approve (including any conditions of approval) or deny the application and state the reasons therefor. 
b.  In making its recommendation to the board of aldermen on those developments and uses for which the evidence submitted, as required in subsection (3) of this section, the planning and zoning commission may recommend approval of developments and uses that: 
1.  Are consistent with good planning practice. 
2.  Can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted uses in the district. 
3.  Can be developed and operated in a manner that is visually compatible with the permitted uses in the surrounding area. 
4.  Will not significantly increase traffic congestion or other hazards. 
5.  Will not increase fire hazards. 
6.  Will not overtax public utilities at the desired intensity of use. 
7.  Will not injure the value of neighboring property or create limitations on the future development of neighboring properties. 
8.  Comply with the recommendations of the city's comprehensive plan or any sub-area plans that are applicable to the neighborhood or sector of the city. 
If the facts of the case do not establish that the standards set forth in this chapter will be met, the planning and zoning commission shall recommend that the board of aldermen deny the request. 
c.  In recommending approval of conditional use permit applications, the planning and zoning commission may recommend such conditions as it determines necessary to meet the aforementioned standards. These conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
1.  Permitted uses, including maximum floor area. 
2.  Performance standards. 
3.  Height limitations. 
4.  Minimum yard requirements. 
5.  Off-street parking and loading requirements.

10.  All proposed landscaping. 
These and any other conditions deemed necessary by the commission may be made more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the respective zoning district within which the conditional use will be located. 
d.  If for any reason the planning and zoning commission is unable to make a recommendation for either approval or denial to the board of aldermen on an application for a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning commission's failure to make a recommendation shall be deemed to be a recommendation of denial and the application may be forwarded to the board of aldermen without an explicit recommendation or report, provided that in the event the commission is unable to make a recommendation, any member or group of members that form less than a quorum of the planning and zoning commission may make a statement of recommendations on the application, which may be received by the board of aldermen as evidence at the board's public hearing on the petition. 
(5)  Board of aldermen review of decision.

b.  Board of aldermen decision. Following the hearing by the board of aldermen, the board by resolution may approve or deny an application for a conditional use permit and in doing so may adopt, reject or modify, in whole or in part, any recommendation of the planning and zoning commission. The board's decision shall be based on its determinations as to whether the proposed conditional use: 
1.  Is consistent with good planning practice. 
2.  Can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted uses in the district. 
3.  Can be developed and operated in a manner that is visually compatible with the permitted uses in the surrounding area. 
4.  Will not significantly increase traffic congestion or other hazards. 
5.  Will not increase fire hazards. 
6.  Will not overtax public utilities at the desired intensity of use. 
7.  Will not injure the value of neighboring property or create limitations on the future development of neighboring properties. 
8.  Complies with the city's comprehensive plan or any sub-area plans that are applicable to the neighborhood or sector of the city. 
9.  Has been shown by applicant to satisfy the criteria of subsection (3) of this section. 
10.  Necessitates the board's imposition of conditions to ensure that the proposed use meets, and will continue to meet, the standards set forth in this article.

(6)  Permit effective when. A conditional use permit or an amendment thereto shall become effective upon the board of aldermen's adoption of a resolution approving the conditional use. In the event that a conditional use permit is filed in conjunction with a change of zoning, the permit shall not become effective until the date of enactment of the ordinance authorizing the zoning change. In the event that some additional approval is required by some other governmental authority or agency, the permit shall not become effective until that approval is received. 
(7)  Notice of denial. Upon denial by the board of aldermen of an application for a conditional use permit, the community development director shall give written notice of its decision by delivering or mailing such notice to each party or his attorney of record and shall upon request furnish him with a copy of the resolution, decision or written statement of the reasons on which the board based its decision. 
(8)  Effect of denial. No subsequent application for the same use with reference to the same property or part thereof concerning the same conditional use shall be filed by any applicant until the expiration of 12 months after the denial becomes final. Although the applicant is restrained from reapplying for a 12-month period, no provision herein shall be construed to prevent the commission or the board of aldermen from initiating the procedure provided in this section by a resolution of intention at any time within that 12-month period or later.

A fee for a certificate of occupancy shall be charged as approved. 
(g)  Grading permit. It is unlawful for any person to clear, grade, excavate, fill, remove topsoil from, or change the contour of any land which will alter the natural drainage of stormwater or cause a public nuisance within the city unless a plan for such work has been submitted to the building official/city engineer for review and approval, and a permit therefor has been issued.

(h)  Voiding of occupancy permit. Any occupancy permit granted under this chapter shall become null and void unless construction or use is commenced within 180 days and construction completed 360 days of the date of issuance. 
(i)  Stop work orders. The cessation of any erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use in violation of this chapter may be effected by posting a stop work or stop use notice on the premises or by notice in writing to the owner of the property involved or to the owner's agent or to the person doing the work, in the case of a stop work order, stating the nature of the violation. 
(j)  Compliance with permits and certificates. Permits or certificates issued on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement or construction.

Such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning commission. In determining whether the landscaping plan is reasonably suitable, the planning and zoning commission shall take into consideration the nature of the location, the impact on surrounding properties, the safety and security of the proposed off-premises billboard, and the relative cost of the landscaping, lighting and fencing to the applicant in relationship to the overall impact upon the property values in the immediate area which would be caused by a lack of such landscaping, lighting and fencing for the proposed off-premises billboard. 
h.  Nuisances. Any off-premises billboard which, because of lack of maintenance, upkeep, vandalism, accumulation of litter, refuse or debris, or the deterioration of landscaping, lighting or fencing, becomes unsightly or unsafe is hereby declared to be a nuisance and shall be subject to abatement by the city in the same manner as all other nuisances on private property. 
i.  Service drives. Direct access to off-premises billboards from curb cuts along a state highway or service road shall be prohibited, unless approved by MoDOT. Direct access shall be gained through paved roads and drives that are private and internal to a lot or parcel. All vehicles, equipment and people used to build, service, maintain and repair such signs must confine their activity so as not to interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic on public roads.

4.  Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall submit a sign survey to indicate the relative vertical and horizontal distances between the proposed sign and all other pole-mounted signs within 2,000 feet. If by reason of height, size or spacing the proposed sign creates a significant disharmony with pole-mounted signs within 2,000 feet or unreasonably detracts from the visibility of other neighboring signs or properties, the community development director may require reasonable modifications of the sign's dimensions to cure such deficiencies as a condition to granting a permit. 
l.  Annual inspection. All billboards shall have an annual inspection to verify compliance with all applicable city land use standards. 
(d)  Annual inspection. Owners of all signs erected shall be required to submit an inspection report from a state licensed engineer as to the sign's structural integrity.

CHAPTER 410. - SUBDIVISIONS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 410.010. - Purpose. 
(a)  Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been divided into streets, blocks, lots and open spaces, a pattern has been established which usually determines how well the community needs for residence, business and industry will be met. It also determines to a great extent how well the community will be able to handle its traffic circulation problems, how well it will be able to provide the main services demanded of it. 
(b)  After land has been subdivided and publicly recorded, it is very difficult and costly to correct defects and deficiencies in the subdivision layout and in the facilities provided. In addition, a subdivided area sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. The guidance of land development in harmony with community objectives is, therefore, a matter of serious public concern, and it is in the interest of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. 
(c)  The purpose of these regulations, then, is to control the division of land within the city in order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the city by regulating the division and redivision of land in order to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to further the orderly development and appropriate use of land; to establish accurate records of land subdivisions; to protect land title; to implement the various chapters and components of the comprehensive plan; to secure safety from fire and other dangers; to facilitate adequate and coordinated provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds and other public requirements; to facilitate the further division of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land; to preserve natural features such as stands of trees, streams, significant rock formations, historical landmarks; and, in general, to facilitate the orderly, coordinated, efficient and economic development of the city.

(a)  These subdivision regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority granted by the city's authority to regulate the public health, welfare and safety and the authority granted by, among other places, RSMo chs. 89 and 445. The city planning and zoning commission, which was established in accordance with RSMo ch. 89 , has fulfilled the requirement set forth in the applicable sections of the revised statutes as necessary for the adoption of such regulations by the board of aldermen. These regulations provide a procedure and minimum standards of design and construction by which the city planning and zoning commission and board of aldermen can equitably appraise all proposed plats for land subdivision, plat preparation, review and approval requirements. 
(b)  The subdivision and resubdivision of land within the city shall be upon a plat and submitted to the city planning and zoning commission for its approval or disapproval. With the exception of parcels divided under certain special procedures in article VII of this chapter, the lot split procedure, all record plats shall receive a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission and with the planning commission's approval or disapproval endorsed thereon shall be submitted to the board of aldermen for its consideration and approval or disapproval. No plat shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, except as provided for in these regulations. No lot subject to these regulations shall be sold unless first established by provisions of these regulations. No building permit shall be issued for construction on a parcel or lot created in violation of these regulations.

Sec. 410.030. - Conflicts with other ordinances. 
    Wherever there is a discrepancy between the minimum standards set forth in or adopted pursuant to these regulations and those of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the most restrictive or highest standards shall apply. Moreover, nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the subdivider from placing self-imposed restrictions or imposing higher standards than required by these regulations, but not in violation of these regulations, on the development. Such restrictions shall be indicated or attached to the plat for processing by the city and filing with the recorder of deeds.

Upon completion of all improvements and prior to dedication of such improvements to the city a maintenance deposit must be established. 
(b)  Exceptions. The director of public works may require any specific improvement to be installed prior to approval of the record plat where the failure to install such improvement prior to further development could result in damage to the site or other surrounding properties. 
(c)  Deposit options. All deposits required in this section shall be submitted in conjunction with a city deposit agreement and may be in the form of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit, and in some limited circumstances, a surety bond as follows: 
(1)  Cash escrow. Cash deposited with the director of public works to be held in an interest bearing account dedicated for that purpose, with all interest accruing to the city to offset administrative and other costs of maintaining the cash deposits. 
(2)  Letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit drawn on a local financial institution in the city's approved format. The letter of credit shall provide that the issuing institution will pay to the city such amounts necessary, up to the maximum available limit, to complete the improvements as described herein. The letter of credit shall be irrevocable for a period of at least three years and may be reduced in writing as deemed appropriate by the director of public works. 
(3)  Surety bond. In certain circumstances, for good cause shown, the city may accept a bond issued by a bond company licensed in the state so long as the bond adheres to the city's approved format. 
(d)  Types and amounts of deposits. The types and amounts of the deposits required by this section shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Construction deposit. The deposit required of a developer shall be in the amount of 110 percent of the engineer's approved construction cost estimate for completion of the required improvements. Where the developer elects to complete portions of the improvements prior to plat approval, the gross deposit shall be reduced by the engineer's approved cost estimate for such completed improvements. 
(2)  Maintenance deposit. A developer shall be required to establish a maintenance deposit in the amount of five percent of the engineer's approved construction cost estimate to guarantee that continuing maintenance and or repair obligations are fulfilled after improvements have been accepted for dedication by the city.

(e)  Construction deposit agreement; extension of completion period. 
(1)  The developer and the city shall enter into a fully executed deposit agreement ("deposit agreement"), in a form unaltered from the city's standard document (approved and authorized by subsection (m) of this section), which shall require the developer to fulfill the obligations imposed in this section. The deposit agreement authorizes the director of public works to release or reduce deposits held as permitted herein. Reductions may only occur upon approval by the director of public works once all required improvements within a category have been completed, inspected, and all deficiencies addressed. Full releases will be made only upon the completion of all categories of improvements. 
(2)  If at the end of the two-year completion period as established in the deposit agreement (the "completion period"), all improvements as shown on the approved improvement plans have not been completed, the developer may request that the director of public works amend the deposit agreement to grant an extension of such completion period. Upon this request the director of public works, if it is deemed necessary, may grant an extension of no more than one year to facilitate the completion of all improvements as shown on the approved improvement plans. Prior to granting the extension all applicable guarantees must be extended and approved by the director of public works. The director of public works may also require, as part of an amended deposit agreement, recalculation of deposit amounts, the satisfaction of any amended or new code requirements, or other reasonable conditions as may be necessary to ensure that the extended deposit agreement fully complies with the terms of this section. 
(f)  (1)  Improvement completion by category. For the purposes of this section, improvements shall be deemed "complete" only when the city certifies that:

c.  Step 3. The city shall conduct an initial re-inspection at no charge within 20 business days of receiving a written request. If any or all deficiencies have not been corrected, the city will again notify the developer of those deficiencies through a written inspection report. Any subsequent inspections conducted by the city will require the payment of a $100.00 re-inspection fee and may include the identification of other deficiencies as deemed necessary by the city. 
d.  Step 4. After an inspection has been completed, where all noted deficiencies have been addressed, a written notice approving the inspection will be sent to the developer, the developer's financial institution or surety, and/or other requested third parties. As the inspection is only a single component of improvement completion, all other completion items as noted above must be addressed prior to any deposit reduction or release. 
Nothing herein shall preclude the public works department from conducting additional inspections at its discretion or as a courtesy to the developer. 
(g)  Deposits use and release. 
(1)  Construction deposit. A developer shall establish a deposit, through the options described in subsection (c) of this section, pertaining to deposit options, under a deposit agreement to guarantee the construction of all improvements. 
a.  Construction deposit use. The construction deposit shall be required by the city to guarantee the developer's completion of the required improvements within the completion period or to defray or fund any costs incurred by the city to complete those improvements or remedy deficiencies if the developer is absent or for any reason is unable to properly complete the work. 
b.  Construction deposit release. The amount held for any category of improvement for an entire subdivision or any previously defined and approved portion of a subdivision such as a phase shall be released within 30 days of completion of said category as defined above, minus retention of five percent. The final five percent shall be released only upon (1) completion of all categories of improvements, and (2) dedication of all improvements by the board of alderman through an ordinance: 
1.  All categories of improvements, as described in the engineer's approved cost estimate and the deposit agreement, have been completed per subsection (f) of this section and approved by the director of public works; and 
2.  An improvement maintenance deposit and water quality/stormwater post-construction guarantee have been established and accepted by the director of public works. 
After approval of the resolution an executed copy will be forwarded to the developer and the developer's financial institution or surety along with a notice authorizing the release of the remaining five percent. 
(2)  Maintenance deposit. Upon commencement of installation of the required improvements within the subject subdivision, the developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of those improvements, including undeveloped lots, streets, sidewalks, utilities, subdivision amenities, common areas, and storm and drainage facilities, until the sooner of: (1) 12 months after dedication of all improvements by the board of alderman through an ordinance, or (2) 90 percent of all homes have been constructed and the corresponding final occupancy permits have been issued. To cover ongoing obligations during building construction, the developer may choose to retain the maintenance deposit with the city until 100 percent build-out or instead use the individual lot deposit described below for the final ten percent of homes constructed or those constructed more than 12 months after dedication. The developer shall establish a maintenance deposit, through the options described in subsection (c) of this section, pertaining to deposit options, under a deposit agreement to guarantee that any and all repairs are made to improvements that may be damaged during the construction of homes or buildings within the subject subdivision. 
a.  Maintenance deposit use. During the maintenance period the developer shall be responsible for the replacement or repair of any deficient or defective improvements including, but not limited to, broken, failing, displaced, or settling street slabs, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, leaking water mains, or other failures of constructed improvements as well as any broken, failing, and or damaged subdivision amenities. This maintenance shall also include, but is not limited to, repairs or replacements to address damage to streets, street signs, fire hydrants, manholes, subdivision amenities or other public improvements that may occur due to vehicular traffic, construction equipment, or other construction activities as well as abatement of nuisances caused by or related to such improvements, such as removal of mud and debris from streets, erosion control, grass cutting, removal of construction materials (except materials to be used for construction or as otherwise permitted). The developer must provide a minimum of 24 hours' notice prior to beginning any maintenance work during this maintenance period so that a city representative may be present to verify that all work is completed in accordance with the approved improvement plans and all city standards. The deposit will be subject to withdrawal by the city to reimburse or defray the cost of maintenance that may be assumed by the department. However, except in emergency circumstances or when action is required before written notice can be provided, the director of public works shall provide the developer with a written notice and the opportunity to complete the work prior to any work being completed by the department. 
b.  Maintenance deposit release. After the construction of all homes is complete and issuance of final occupancy permits the director of public works will cause a final inspection to be made of the required public improvements and subdivision amenities. If there are no outstanding maintenance items or other deficiencies found and all other obligations are shown to be satisfied on inspection thereof, or at such time thereafter as any maintenance, defects or deficiencies are corrected with the permission of, and within the time allowed by, the director of public works, then the maintenance deposit and obligations shall then be released. This release shall in no way be construed to release any person from any civil liability that may exist for or waive any right of the city to pursue a remedy for any defects or damages caused by any construction, improvement or development for which any deposit has been released. 
(3)  Individual lot deposit. Prior to issuance of a building permit, the public improvements on or adjacent to each individual lot must be covered by a deposit applicable subdivision or as an alternative the developer/builder may select the ten percent of homes constructed or those constructed more than 12 months after as described in subsection (c) of this section pertaining to deposit options, under a deposit agreement to guarantee construction of homes or buildings within the subject lot. Prior to the issuance of a builder shall be responsible for the documentation of the existing site conditions. With city concurrence the builder shall not be held responsible for pre-existing conditions, however the builder will be held responsible for maintenance/repair of sewer utilities, subdivision amenities, common areas, sediment and erosion control and storm and drainage facilities. 
a.  Individual lot deposit use. During home/building construction the builder shall be responsible for repairing any damaged improvements including not limited to, repairs or replacements to address damage to streets, street signs, fire hydrants, manholes, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, subdivision amenities or other public improvements that may occur due to vehicular traffic, construction equipment, or other construction activities as well as abatement/remediation of nuisances caused by grading or related to such improvements, such as removal of mud and debris from streets, adjacent properties, erosion control, grass cutting, removal of construction materials (except materials to be used for construction or as otherwise permitted). The builder must provide a minimum of 24 hours' notice prior to beginning any repair work during this period so that a city representative may be present to verify that all work is completed in accordance with the approved improvement plans and all city standards. The deposit will be subject to withdrawal by the city to reimburse or defray the cost of repairs that may be assumed by the city. However, except in emergency circumstances or when action is required before written notice can be provided, the director of public works shall provide the builder with a written notice and the opportunity to complete the work prior to any work being completed by the city. If a $10,000.00 citywide lot deposit is in place for a lot and the city is forced to utilize a portion of those funds to correct deficiencies the full value of the deposit must be replenished prior to issuance of any new building permits to that builder. 
b.  Individual lot deposit release. After construction of the home/building is complete the public works department, in coordination with the community development department final occupancy inspection, will conduct a final inspection of the public improvements associated with that individual lot. With a passing inspection verifying that all repairs have been satisfactorily completed the final occupancy permit will be issued and the $1,000.00 individual lot deposit will be released. If the $10,000.00 citywide lot deposit is in place the final occupancy permit will be issued however no release will take place and the full $10,000.00 will remain in effect for future building permits. This release shall in no way be construed to release any person from any civil liability that may exist for or waive any right of the city to pursue a remedy for any defects or damages caused by any construction, improvement or development for which any deposit has been released. 
(4)  Grading/sediment erosion protection deposit. The requirements of this guarantee and its released are set forth in section 515.020. 
(5)  Water quality/stormwater post-construction guarantee deposit. A developer shall also establish a separate deposit, through the options described in subsection (c) of this section, pertaining to deposit options, under a deposit agreement to guarantee the construction of the water quality improvements. The developer shall be responsible for the installation of the water quality improvements upon completion of the build-out of a minimum of 90 percent of lots in the subdivision's watershed that are tributary to each water quality improvement or as approved by the director of public works. The developer shall submit to the public works department for its review and approval of current cost estimates of required water quality improvements. 
a.  Water quality/stormwater post-construction guarantee deposit use. The water quality deposit shall be required by the city to guarantee the completion of the required water quality features including, but not limited, to plantings, filters and forebays. 
b.  Water quality/stormwater post-construction guarantee deposit release. Upon the developer's request, the director of public works shall cause a final inspection to be made of the required water quality improvements. Funds shall then be released when BMP and drainage area vegetation are stabilized and there are no defects or deficiencies found and all other obligations are shown to be satisfied upon inspection thereof, or at such time thereafter as any defects or deficiencies are cured under the supervision of, and within the time allowed by the director of public works and provided that the director of public works has received an acceptable maintenance agreement from the homeowner's association or property owner(s) ensuring the future maintenance of the water quality improvements. In no case will a water quality deposit release be granted prior to development of at least 90 percent of the subdivision's watershed that is tributary to each water quality improvement. 
(6)  Site plan performance guarantee. The requirements of this guarantee and its release are set forth in section 405.900. 
(h)  Successor developer/replacement deposit agreements. If a developer who has established a deposit with the city to guarantee completion of improvements, transfers title of the subdivision property prior to the city's acceptance of all improvements or the complete release of funds the successor developer must establish a new construction deposit to guarantee the completion of improvements under a new deposit agreement. This deposit must match the funds currently held under the original deposit agreement and will carry with it a two-year completion period from the approval date. Only upon approval of the successor developer's deposit agreement will the city release the deposit established by the original developer as well as release the original developer from all further obligations with respect to the subdivision improvements provided that the successor developer assumes all outstanding obligations under the successor developer deposit agreement. 
The successor developer or replacement deposit agreement process may also apply to the maintenance deposit. If a developer transfer's title of the subdivision property to an individual developer/builder prior to completion of the 12 month or 90 percent build-out period a successor builder may replace the maintenance agreement in full. Upon approval of the new maintenance agreement and confirmation of the deposit to fulfill the 12-month or 90 percent build-out obligation the original developers deposit will be released in full and all responsibility for maintenance transferred to the new developer/builder. 
(i)  Failure to complete improvements. The obligation of the developer to construct, complete, install, maintain and warrant the improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans and provide for maintenance of those improvements shall not cease until the developer shall be finally released by the director of public works, nor shall any deposit agreements or obligations hereunder be assignable by developer. If, after the initial improvement completion period, or after a later period as extended pursuant to this section, the improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans are not constructed, completed, installed, accepted and/or maintained as required, or if the developer shall violate any provision of the deposit agreement, the director of public works may notify the developer of the deficiencies and direct the developer to cure the deficiencies or to show cause within not less than ten days why the developer should not be declared in default. If the developer fails to cure any deficiencies or present compelling reason why no default should be declared, the director of public works shall declare the developer in default and may take any one or more of the following acts: 
(1)  Deem the remaining balance under the deposit agreement as forfeited to the city, to be then placed in an appropriate trust and account subject to the order of the director of public works for such purposes as letting contracts to bring about the completion or maintenance of the improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans, performance of any tasks required for the completion of improvements or other appropriate purposes in the interest of the public safety, health and welfare; 
(2)  Require the developer or lender to pay to the city the remaining balance of the letter of credit or surety bond or draw upon the funds held by the city pursuant to a cash deposit; and/or 
(3)  Require the developer to submit an additional cash sum sufficient to guarantee the completion or maintenance of the improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans after recalculation in order to allow for any inflated or increased costs of constructing or maintaining the improvements. 
Notwithstanding the above, the failure of the developer to complete the improvement obligations within the time provided by the deposit agreement (or any extension granted by the city), and including the payment of funds to the city due to such failure or an expiration of a letter of credit, shall be deemed an automatic act of default entitling the city to all remedies provided in this section and the deposit agreement without further or prior notice. It shall be the sole responsibility of the developer to timely request an extension of any deposit agreement if the improvements are not completed in the original time period provided by the deposit agreement and no right to any extension shall exist or be assumed. 
(j)  Other remedies for default. If the board of aldermen determine that the developer or surety has failed to comply with the director of public works requirements for payment as described above or has failed to complete the improvements as required or otherwise violates the deposit agreement provisions, and that there is a risk that development of the subdivision and/or individual lots therein will continue in the subdivision without the timely prior completion of improvements or compliance with deposit agreement provisions, the board of aldermen may, in addition or alternatively to other remedies: 
(1)  Direct that no building or other permit be issued to the developer in the subdivision during any period in which the developer is in violation of the deposit agreement or subdivision code relating to the subdivision. 
(2)  Suspend the right of anyone to build or construct on the undeveloped portion of the subdivision. For the purpose of this subsection (j), the term "undeveloped portion" of the subdivision means all lots other than lots which have been sold for personal use and occupancy or are under bona fide contract for sale to any person for personal use or occupancy. The city shall give the developer ten business days' written notice of an order under this subsection (j), with copies to all sureties, as appropriate, who have outstanding obligations for any undeveloped portion of the subdivision, and shall record an affidavit of such notice with the recorder of deeds. If, within the ten-day period after notice is given, the board is not convinced by compelling evidence that completion of the improvements is adequately assured and maintenance of streets assured as provided herein, the board shall order construction suspended on the undeveloped portion of the subdivision. The order shall be served upon the developer, with a copy to the issuer of the surety as appropriate, and a copy recorded with the recorder of deeds. Public notice of said order shall be conspicuously and prominently posted by the director of public works at the subdivisions or lots subject to said order. The notice shall contain the following minimum language, which may be supplemented at the discretion of the director of public works. 
a.  If said notice is for a subdivision: 
THIS SUBDIVISION, (name of subdivision), HAS BEEN DECLARED IN DEFAULT BY THE CITY OF WENTZVILLE BOARD OF ALDERMEN. NO DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, BUILDING OR DEMOLITION IN ANY MANNER SHALL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS SUBDIVISION UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE CITY OF WENTZVILLE REMOVES THIS PROHIBITION. ANY DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, BUILDING OR DEMOLITION IN ANY MANNER WHILE THIS PROHIBITION IS IN EFFECT IS ILLEGAL AND SHALL BE ENFORCED PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 410 OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE OF WENTZVILLE, AS AMENDED. 
b.  If said notice is for a lot: 
THIS LOT, (lot number), HAS BEEN DECLARED IN DEFAULT BY THE CITY OF WENTZVILLE BOARD OF ALDERMEN. NO DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, BUILDING OR DEMOLITION IN ANY MANNER SHALL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS LOT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE CITY OF WENTZVILLE REMOVES THIS PROHIBITION. ANY DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, BUILDING OR DEMOLITION IN ANY MANNER WHILE THIS PROHIBITION IS IN EFFECT IS ILLEGAL AND SHALL BE ENFORCED PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 410 OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE OF WENTZVILLE, AS AMENDED. 
No department of the city shall thereafter authorize construction to take place contrary to the board of aldermen's order. The suspension shall be rescinded in whole or in part only when the board of aldermen, or their designee, determines that completion of the improvements is adequately assured in all or an appropriate part of the subdivision and a guarantee of public street maintenance provided; or 
(3)  Suspend the rights of the developer, or any related entity, to construct structures in any development platted after the effective date of such suspension throughout city and such incorporated areas as are under city jurisdiction. The developer shall be given ten business days' written notice of an order under this clause, with a copy to sureties known to the public works department to have obligations outstanding on behalf of the developer or related entities and shall record an affidavit of such notice with the recorder of deeds. If, within the ten-day period after notice is given, the board of aldermen is not convinced by compelling evidence that completion of the improvements is adequately assured and maintenance of streets assured as provided herein, the board shall order construction suspended. The order shall be served upon the developer, with a copy to the surety as appropriate, and a copy recorded with the recorder of deeds. No department of the city shall thereafter authorize construction to take place contrary to the board's order. The suspension shall be rescinded only when the board of aldermen is convinced that completion of the improvements is adequately assured and public street maintenance is assured. 
(k)  Suspension of development rights. In addition to subsection (j) of this section, from and after the effective date of this section if the developer, or any related entity, has a subdivision development improvement guarantee that is in default, as determined by the director of public works, including any escrow or bond under any prior version of this section, the rights of the developer, or any related entity, to receive development approval, which approval shall include, but not be limited to, approval of any plat or deposit agreement for new or further development in the city, shall be suspended. The suspension shall be rescinded only when the board of aldermen, or its designee, determines that completion and maintenance of the improvements is adequately assured. 
(l)  Additional remedies. If any party fails to comply with any obligation of this section, the director of public works may recommend that the city attorney take appropriate legal action and may also withhold any building or occupancy permits to this developer or related entities until such compliance is cured. The city shall also have the right to partially or wholly remedy a developer's deficiencies or breached obligations under this Code by set-off of any funds or assets otherwise held by the city of the developer to the maximum extent permitted by law. Such set-off shall occur upon written notice of such event by the director of public works to the developer after the developer has failed to timely cure the deficiencies. It shall be deemed a provision of every deposit agreement authorized under this chapter that the developer shall pay the city's costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, of enforcing such agreement in the event that the developer is judicially determined to have violated any provision herein or in such agreement. 
(m)  Deposit agreements; approval; filing. Deposit agreements substantially in the form of, and with terms no less favorable to the city than are contained in, the deposit agreement attached to the ordinance from which this section is derived are hereby approved and the mayor and/or director of public works, or their designee, are authorized to execute such deposit agreements on behalf of the city. Each subdivision deposit agreement shall be fully executed and on file with the director of public works prior to plat approval. Any plat recorded prior to execution of a deposit agreement and its placement on file with the director of public works shall be voidable by the city.

The indenture shall provide for proper maintenance and supervision by the trustees who are selected to act in accordance with the terms of such indenture and the applicable provisions of these regulations. For single lot developments and developments with no common ground, the city may accept script certifying the means of maintenance on the record plat. Common land shall be conveyed by the owner in fee simple absolute title by deed to the homeowners' association and the trust indentures shall provide that the common land and any permanent landscape easement be for the benefit, use and enjoyment of the lot owners present and future and shall be the maintenance responsibility of the homeowners' association of the subdivision and that no lot owner shall have the right to convey his/her interest in the common land except as an incident of the ownership of a regularly platted lot.

(c)  A trust indenture shall be required for a large lot subdivision only in the event that common land or other private improvement is contained within the subdivision. 
(d)  Term of indentures for all types of subdivisions, including planned districts, shall be for the duration of the subdivision. In the event the subdivision is vacated, fee simple title shall vest in then lot or unit owners as tenants in common. The rights of the tenants shall only be exercisable appurtenant to, and in conjunction with, their lot or unit ownership. Any conveyance or change of ownership of any lot or unit shall convey with it ownership in the common land and no interest in the common land shall be conveyed by a lot or unit owner except in conjunction with the sale of a lot or unit. The sale of any lot or unit shall carry with it all the incidents of ownership of the common land although such is not expressly mentioned in the deed; provided however, that no right or power conferred upon the trustees shall be abrogated. 
(e)  If a project provides for common property, a trust indenture shall provide for the payment of assessments by the property owners on no greater than a yearly basis beginning within one year of recording of the final plat; however, a payment schedule on less than a yearly basis may be included. For that period of time in which the developer appoints the majority of the trustees, the homeowners' association shall be responsible for the management of the assessment account. 
(f)  Subdivision indentures shall not prohibit builders of homes from maintaining signage on common ground and any private (non-public) right-of-way advertising the subdivision and homes for sale until the last home is sold in the subdivision. 
(g)  Any trust indenture required to be recorded for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of these regulations or the zoning regulations shall state, "Where the provisions of this trust indenture cannot be fulfilled by reason of unfilled vacancies among the directors or Trustees arising due to default or inaction by the developer, the board of aldermen of the city or its successors may, upon petition of any concerned resident or owner in the subdivision and upon providing advance written notice to such developer, appoint one or more directors or trustees to fill the vacancies until such time as directors or Trustees are elected or selected in the manner provided in this Indenture. So long as the provision regarding the city's appointment of directors and trustees to fill vacancies exists in this Code, the corresponding provision of the trust indenture may not be amended without permission of the board of aldermen."

ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 410.170. - Purpose. 
(a)  The city is authorized under its police powers, RSMo 89.410 , to specify design requirements for streets, blocks, lots, utilities, recreation areas, other public facilities and hazardous areas, including land subject to flooding within the city. The city is also empowered to ensure that these standards are enforced as a condition of subdivision plat approval. 
(b)  These standards for public improvements shall be utilized to assure the conformance of new subdivisions to the city's comprehensive plan as well as the zoning regulations. Toward these goals, the commission is also given the authority to require the dedication, reservation or acquisition of lands and open spaces necessary for public uses indicated on the city plan so long as the required dedication is reasonably related to the subdivider's activity. 
(c)  The standards set forth in this article are minimum acceptable standards of design for safe, efficient and economical community development. The developer shall be responsible for providing the land and constructing those public improvements required to serve his development in conformance with the requirements of these regulations. 
(Code 2008, § 410.180; Ord. No. 3001, § 4, 6-24-2009) 
Sec. 410.180. - Suitability of land for subdivision development. 
(a)  The following standards have been determined to be indispensable elements for desirable development. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be designed to provide desirable building sites and logically related to topography, natural features, streets, parking areas, common land and adjacent land uses. If the planning commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations and other such natural features or conditions as may increase the danger of health, life or property, or aggravate erosion or flood hazards; and, if from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the land should not be platted and developed for the purpose proposed, the planning commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider for meeting the problems that will be created by the subdivision and the development of the land. 
(b)  The planning commission may deny scattered or premature subdivision of land which would involve danger or injury to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of lack of adequate water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads and transportation facilities or other public services; or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for supply of such services. 
(Code 2008, § 410.190; Ord. No. 3001, § 4, 6-24-2009) 
Sec. 410.190. - Street standards. 
(a)  General standards. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and proposed streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, roadway maintenance and access by emergency vehicles and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. In subdivision developments of more than 100 units, two or more access points to the city's street system shall be constructed. Streets shall be constructed in compliance with the requirements embodied within the engineering design criteria, latest edition and the construction specifications and standard detail documents as approved by the city engineer and on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  Easements and rights-of-way. The following requirements shall apply to all subdivisions except those demonstrating no attributable impact to the city's roadway system: 
(1)  Any subdivision platted along an existing street shall provide additional right-of-way conforming to the city transportation master plan and the classification, design criteria and standards of the engineering design criteria sections 7.03.01 through 7.03.03.01, as applicable. Dedicated rights-of-way shall be provided for proposed subdivisions that abut county roads or roads maintained by the state department of transportation (MoDOT). Additional right-of-way in excess of the standard dedication for widening may be required by the city engineer when the subdivision is located on the inside of a curved roadway or when conditions exist on the opposite side of the right-of-way that dictate right-of-way offset from the centerline. 
a.  When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, required right-of-way width shall be measured from the centerline of the right-of-way as originally established or as traveled. The centerline must meet requirements of the city engineer with regard to radius when located on a curved roadway. When the subdivision is located having more than one street frontage, right-of-way shall be provided along all road frontages, subject to preliminary plat review and approval. 
b.  Any subdivision platted along an existing street identified for widening and improvement conforming to the city transportation master plan shall provide a temporary construction easement/license not less than 20 feet in width granted to the city for future cuts, fills, grading, sloping embankments, construction drives or temporary roadways and utilities. The easement shall provide for its termination upon the completion of the roadway widening or improvement project. 
c.  Any subdivision platted that is located on property identified by an adopted corridor preservation plan by the city shall provide right-of-way to the city under the direction of the adopted corridor preservation plan. 
(2)  A subdivision plat involving new or existing streets crossing railroad tracks shall provide adequate rights-of-way, including approach rights-of-way and slope easements for construction of an underpass or overpass, unless otherwise specified by the planning and zoning commission. Approval of the state department of transportation and the city engineer must be received in connection with all railroad crossings. 
(3)  Where a cut or fill for a street extends beyond the limits of the right-of-way, the developer shall provide a slope easement or special escrow as determined by the city engineer to be of sufficient area and limits to permit the construction and maintenance of the slope. 
(c)  Construction and design. 
(1)  Streets in all zoning or land use categories shall be constructed to conform to the city engineering design criteria and the standard specifications and construction details as approved by the city engineer and recorded with the office of the city clerk. 
(2)  Private streets, including multiple-family access streets, shall have pavement thickness constructed to city standards. Maintenance of these streets shall be the sole responsibility of the property owners or trustees of the subdivision. 
(3)  All streets shall be graded and the roadway improved by surfacing. Roadway surfacing shall be in accordance with the city standard specifications and construction details as approved by the city engineer and recorded with the office of the city clerk. All grading and surfacing shall be done under observation and inspection of the city engineer and shall be subject to his approval. The treatment of the intersection of any new street with a state highway and any additional required widening of an adjoining state highway shall be subject to approval by the district engineer of this state department of transportation. 
(4)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning and zoning commission may require additional lot depth with landscape screen planting. Access to subdivided lots shall only be from internal project streets. 
(5)  In all developments, streets ending in a cul-de-sac turn-a-round shall not exceed 1,500 feet except as the community development director/city engineer deems necessary to secure the efficient use of land or desired features of street layout. A pavement radius of 55 feet shall be provided on streets ending at, or in excess of, 1,500 feet. 
(6)  All developments with lots solely fronting on arterial or collector streets shall provide a turnaround maneuvering area or provide side or rear entry garages as required in section 405.550(b) which eliminates having to back out onto streets.

(3)  All the names of streets proposed by the subdivider shall be approved by the county government prior to the approval of a record plat. 
(b)  Traffic signs. 
(1)  The subdivider shall bear all expense for the purchase and installation of traffic signs and signals as the result of his development. Installation size and height, type and location of all traffic signage shall comply with city engineering department standard construction details. 
(2)  If the subdivider proposed upgraded traffic signs exceeding standard installation equipment, the subdivider shall be responsible for the maintenance of upgraded/enhanced traffic signage, that shall be made a part of the homeowners' association responsibility for maintenance. Standard subdivision covenants and restrictions shall contain provisions to describe responsibility for maintenance. 
(c)  Street name change. Any proposed change to an existing street name shall be made in writing to the office of the community development director. The community development director shall accept the written request, if complete, indicating location and all necessary details for the city's review. The community development director shall notify the county government for name approval correspondence, the city administrator, public works director and other staff as applicable for review of the request. The planning division shall prepare a resolution to be presented to the board of aldermen at a regularly scheduled meeting. If the board deems it necessary to change the name of any street or avenue, the resolution shall be published for at least one week in a newspaper published within the city and notices shall be sent to all resident owners along the line of such street. The public advertisement shall be made in sufficient time to allow resident owners along such street to file with the city clerk written protests against the name change. If written protests from a majority of resident owners along the line of the street are not received after four weeks, the board of aldermen may have the power to change, by ordinance, the name of a street or avenue. The city clerk shall file with the county recorder of deeds a certified copy of such ordinance.

(Code 2008, § 410.270; Ord. No. 3001, § 4, 6-24-2009) 
Sec. 410.260. - Tree preservation requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. In furtherance of the goals of the comprehensive plan and the zoning regulations of the city, it is the purpose of this section to promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare by providing for the regulation of the preservation of trees within the city. These standards are designed to enhance the quality and appearance of developed properties, protect existing natural resources, buffer differing land uses and conserve the value of land and buildings throughout the city. These standards will also buffer noise and wind, increase energy efficiency through shading and cooling, filter air pollution, assist in the management of stormwater and provide wildlife habitat as well as pleasant visual relief. 
(b)  Applicability. These standards apply to all residential subdivisions within the city except the following: 
(1)  Individual single-family residences not in a proposed or existing subdivision. 
(2)  Individual two-family residences not in a proposed or existing subdivision. 
(3)  Individual multi-family residences not in a proposed or existing subdivision. 
(4)  Subdivisions within the "A," "PD-R" and "PD-MXD" zoning districts. 
(5)  Subdivisions which meet the criteria of "lot splits" as found within section 410.410. 
(6)  The proposed site has less than or equal to five percent of the proposed subdivision in woodlands as depicted on an aerial photo of at least three years prior to submittal. In developments which meet this criterion, an inventory of all landmark trees on the site shall be submitted in association with and depicted upon the preliminary plat. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  All residential preliminary subdivision plats shall delineate the anticipated tree preservation limits to be known as the tree preservation plan. Tree preservation information supplied on the preliminary plat shall be as follows: 
a.  The approximate limit of all tree preservation areas. 
b.  Approximate areas where trees are to be removed. Areas showing removal shall be hatched or color coded. 
c.  Estimated acreage calculations for the preservation areas. 
d.  Aerial photo showing the area of trees as they existed three years prior to submittal. Tree preservation areas shall be determined from this aerial photo as a base line for compliance with this section. 
e.  Identification of all landmark trees on the site prior to development in areas that are planned to be disturbed or graded, excluding riparian buffer areas as defined in this chapter. 
(2)  The final tree preservation plan shall be included with the grading plan prior to any land disturbance for a site and have the following: 
a.  Property boundary including north arrow and scale. 
b.  The proposed layout of all lots and public and private rights-of-way. 
c.  Existing and proposed topographic data for the site. 
d.  The location of all known and proposed easements and utility infrastructure. 
e.  The limits of all tree preservation areas to the edge of the canopy drip line, excluding riparian buffer areas as defined in this chapter. 
(d)  Tree preservation requirements. 
(1)  All non-exempt subdivisions shall meet the following standards: 
a.  Subdivisions with between 15 percent and less than 50 percent of the total site in woodlands must preserve a minimum of 15 percent of the total site in woodlands. 
b.  Subdivisions equal to or greater than 50 percent of the total site in woodlands must preserve 25 percent of the total site in woodlands. 
c.  Subdivisions greater than five percent and less than 15 percent of total site in woodlands shall submit a report to the planning and zoning commission requesting to waive or amend tree preservation requirements of this section listing reasons, including, but not limited to: 
1.  Percentage of existing woodlands on site. 
2.  Percentage of woodlands that shall be preserved in lieu of the required 15 percent. 
3.  A tree inventory of the existing woodlands prior to development. A tree inventory shall include, but not be limited to, the location and species of all landmark trees within the proposed subdivision and quality of existing trees on site (cedars, underbrush, dead trees, location of trees/woodlands, etc.). 
Upon review of this information, the planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation to the board of aldermen associated with a preliminary plat on the merits of waiving or amending the tree preservation requirement. No credit will be given to a tree or any portion of a tree canopy that is not located on the subject property. 
(2)  Tree preservation areas shall be located within the following: 
a.  Within common ground; or 
b.  Tree preservation areas may be located within proposed lots, however, shall be protected with a tree preservation easement. 
1.  Tree preservation easements shall be delineated on all record plats, with the plat containing script which dedicates the tree preservation areas to the homeowners' association for the preservation of trees. 
2.  All tree preservation areas shall be noted on the grading plans, improvement plans and all record plats with the following text: "There shall be no clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of trees except as permitted by section 410.260 of the Wentzville Municipal Code." 
3.  If tree preservation areas lay within a designated natural watercourse as defined in section 410.530, no additional script referring to the tree preservation area is required. 
(e)  Protective methods. To maintain compliance with this section, trees to be preserved must be protected from direct and indirect root damage and trunk and crown disturbance. No areas for tree preservation will be allowed for any dead tree and tree in poor health or any tree subject to grade alterations. The following standards shall apply: 
(1)  The protection area around trees shall include all land within the canopy drip line. This area shall remain free from all grading and filling activities. 
(2)  Construction site activities such as, but not limited to, parking, material storage, soil stock piling and concrete washout shall not be permitted within tree protection areas. 
(3)  Tree protection areas should be clearly identified prior to any land disturbance, compliant with a method declared upon the final tree preservation plan. Methods that may be used include snow fence and other fencing or construction stakes. 
(4)  Signs shall be used to designate tree protection areas to be installed and maintained in good condition by the developer. Signs are to be posted visibly on all sides of the preservation area and must be visible throughout the development process. Minimum size for the signs is 24 inches by 36 inches and should state the following: "TREE PROTECTION AREA-Machinery access, dumping or storage of materials and equipment or removal of trees is prohibited." 
(f)  Permitted structures within tree preservation areas. No structures (attached or detached) are allowed within tree preservation areas. Fencing is allowed within tree preservation areas subject to section 405.490. 
(g)  Waiver. The public works director or his designee may grant a waiver after final approval allowing tree preservation areas to be disturbed only in cases of public purpose and necessity or only upon the director's approval of designed site development erosion control measures. 
(h)  Enforcement and penalties. The public works director is hereby charged with the responsibility of administering and enforcing the provisions of the tree preservation program. Removal of trees destroyed or substantially damaged as a result of an act of God shall be exempt from this section. Violations are subject to the general penalty provision of section 410.580. If the tree preservation area drops below the required preservation requirements as set forth in the tree preservation plan for a subdivision approved pursuant to this section, except for canopy removed for distribution of public utilities or as waived/amended by the board of aldermen, the subdivision developer, homeowners' association or other responsible person or persons shall provide the city with a tree assessment prepared by a professional arborist which includes a replanting plan based on the area of woodland canopy removed. The replacement plan shall document a replacement ratio of two hardwood trees to each tree destroyed, damaged or removed within a designated tree preservation area at a size of 21/2 inches in caliper is required to be planted in the subdivision. For purposes of calculating the number of trees to be replaced under a replacement plan, the replacement plan shall assess 200 square feet for each tree within designated woodland. For example, where a subdivision falls 2,000 square feet below the requirement, the following formula would be used: 2,000 square feet divided by 200 square feet equals ten trees removed. Therefore, at the replacement ratio of 2:1, 20 trees would need to be replaced. 
(i)  Performance guarantee. A performance guarantee in accordance with section 410.140 shall be established by the developer prior to construction with surety and other reasonable conditions providing for and securing tree preservation and the viability of plantings in full compliance with the final tree preservation plan. 
(j)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    DBH means the diameter of a tree measured at 41/2 feet above ground; diameter breast height (DBH). 
    Drip line means the outermost perimeter of the crown of a plant as projected vertically to the ground. 
    Tree canopy means the area in square feet of a tree's spread. Existing tree canopy is determined by measuring the ground's surface area that is covered by the branch spread of a single tree. 
    Tree, landmark, means a tree that is in fair or better condition (as defined by standards developed by International Society of Arboriculture) and that equals or exceeds the diameter sizes as follows: 
(1)  Large hardwood (oaks, hickories, etc.): 24 inches DBH. 
(2)  Large softwoods (pines, spruces, etc.): 20 inches DBH. 
A tree in "fair or better" condition is defined as a tree having a normal life expectancy, a relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay, no more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only) and no major insect or disease problems. A lesser-sized tree can be considered a landmark tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional quality or historically significance. Landmark trees may be designated by the board of aldermen after recommendation by the city tree board. 
    Tree preservation area means all land within the canopy drip line of a tree as depicted on the approved tree preservation plan or other plans. 
    Woodland means deciduous hardwood tree varieties with a canopy over 5,000 square feet having at least 30 percent of the trees with a caliper of at least 21/2 inches. 
    Woodland canopy means the total area of canopy within woodland.

    Optimal planting means trees shall be planted during the months of April through October for optimal survival. Exception: During winter months (November through March), trees may be guaranteed to be planted in accordance with the rules established for the tree deposit fund. 
    Residential lot means a lot in a single-family detached and single-family attached residential subdivision. 
    Required tree means a tree of one inch caliper in size of the following species: Softwood varieties and all hardwoods identified in section 405.290(f)(3)e, or as otherwise approved by the community development director. 
    Tree board means the board established pursuant to chapter 245. 
    Tree deposit guarantee means a form supplied by the city to be filled out by builder to ensure the planting of a tree upon any second failure of the final occupancy inspection due to lack of a required tree. 
    Tree deposit fund means a fund established hereunder to ensure the installation of a required tree within the corporate limits of the city. The tree deposit fund shall be monitored and maintained by the community development department and finance department. 
(b)  Required trees. For each residential lot developed pursuant to these subdivision regulations, the developer or homebuilder shall provide and plant a minimum of one tree for every lot or unit prior to inspection by the city to verify completion and compliance with this section upon builder's application for occupancy permit (the "yard inspection") and may be included as a condition upon a temporary occupancy permit. 
(c)  Planting. 
(1)  Because the success of the planting hinges greatly on the climate during tree planting, required trees shall be planted only during optimal planting times. When a builder seeks an occupancy permit during non-optimal planting times, the builder shall be issued a temporary occupancy permit for the required tree. The temporary occupancy shall be for the time period between the application for occupancy permit and the next period of optimal planting. A re-inspection date shall be set for May 15 or as soon thereafter as can be scheduled. Trees not installed within 30 days of their re-inspection date (after May 15 shall require the builder to make a deposit of $150.00 times the required number of trees based upon the number of lots or units for which occupancy permits are requested (the "tree deposit") and enter into a tree deposit guarantee. The tree deposit amount is hereby determined to be the estimated cost to provide the required tree and shall be deposited exclusively in the tree deposit fund. 
(2)  Exception: Where a lot owner declines to have a required tree planted on their lot for any reason, the builder and owner may request that builder either: 
a.  Plant, subject to the city's approval of location, the required tree elsewhere in the development in which the lot is situated; or 
b.  Make a deposit into the tree fund for a planting elsewhere in the city. 
Builder and owner must notify the community development department of this desire on a form provided by the city prior to the final occupancy inspection. 
(d)  Failure to establish tree deposit or plant trees. Any builder who fails to timely establish the tree deposit pursuant to a tree deposit guarantee shall be in violation of this section. Any builder who has established a tree deposit but fails to plant the required trees (either on the subject lot or elsewhere pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section) by the second inspection date shall forfeit the tree deposit funds to the city to be used by the tree board in conjunction with the community development department to ensure planting of the required tree on the subject lot or within the development site where possible. The tree board shall utilize the tree deposit funds within one calendar year from the date of receipt of the funds to install trees within the city during optimal planting times. 
(e)  Coordination of inspections/verification. 
(1)  Inspections and verification of tree plantings will be administered by the department of building safety in conjunction with the verification of yard installations at the final and occupancy permit inspection. 
(2)  During the months of November through May, temporary occupancy permits will be issued due to inclement weather. 
(3)  During the months of May through October, all yards and trees planted shall be installed per this section. The building official may grant extensions of time during the summer due to rain or drought conditions. 
(f)  Further authority. In addition to the above, the community development department is hereby authorized and directed to establish reasonable rules and policies to carry out the intent of this section and to supervise the tree deposit fund and tree planting including: 
(1)  Providing for, upon city verification of completion of the required tree installation, the city finance department to return the tree deposit; and 
(2)  Providing for the tree board to use any forfeited tree deposit funds for the purchase and planting of trees in city parks, rights-of-way, or other public places; and 
(3)  Development of forms for the tree deposit guarantee, owner's declination of acceptance of required tree, and such other necessary forms; and 
(4)  Providing for issuance of occupancy permits upon establishment of a tree deposit guarantee and tree deposit; and 
(5)  Providing that second inspections be subject to administrative fees as with all other occupancy inspections. 
(g)  Tree location. Location of new trees upon a lot or other area within a subdivision shall not be allowed within the following areas: 
(1)  Street rights-of-way; 
(2)  25 feet of street lights; 
(3)  At street intersections or within the required 30 feet sight triangle; and 
(4)  Ten feet of street inlets or manholes. 
(h)  Penalty. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be, upon conviction or a plea of guilty, subject to a fine in accordance with section 100.190.

ARTICLE VI. - PROTECTION OF NATURAL WATERCOURSES 

Sec. 410.450. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the regulations for the protection of natural watercourses set forth in this article is to implement the land use objectives of the city's master plan that recognizes the importance of protecting the city's natural attributes and the importance of utilizing these natural attributes to retain and absorb stormwater runoff and prevent development practices that destroy these natural functions and threaten the health, safety and general welfare of the city's residents. The specific purposes of these standards are to: 
(1)  Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity of floodwaters and regulating base flow; 
(2)  Benefit the community in the following ways: economically, by minimizing encroachment on natural watercourses and the need for engineering solutions; by reducing property damage and threats to safety of watershed residents; by contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the community and thereby preserving the character of the community; by improving the quality of life of its residents; and by increasing property values; 
(3)  Stabilize the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourses; 
(4)  Provide infiltration of stormwater and runoff and reducing impervious surfaces; 
(5)  Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in watercourses; 
(6)  Restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the water resources; 
(7)  Provide quality watercourse habitats with shade and food to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation; 
(8)  Furnish recreational opportunities; and 
(9)  Allow areas for natural watercourses to meander naturally, reducing infrastructure and property damage.

CHAPTER 415. - FLOODWAY AND FLOODWAY FRINGE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 415.010. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact and purposes. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of this state has in RSMo 89.020 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the city, ordains as follows. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
a.  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
b.  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(3)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
a.  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods that are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrator's FIS and illustrative materials dated January 20, 2016, and any future revisions thereto. 
b.  Calculation of water surface profiles is based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
c.  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
d.  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
e.  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in subsection (b)(1) of this section; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard; and 
(4)  Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.

Sec. 415.020. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city, identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for the county on map panels 29183C0180G, 29183C0185G, 29183C0190G, 29183C0195G, 29183C0205G, 29183C0210G, 29183C0215G, and 29183C0220G dated January 20, 2016, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in section 415.050. 
(b)  Floodplain administrator. The community development director is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this chapter. 
(c)  Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires. 
(d)  Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(f)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted with such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)  Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(i)  Appeal. Where a request for a floodplain development permit to develop is denied by the community development director, the applicant may apply for a variance to the board of adjustment.

Sec. 415.060. - Specific standards. 
(a)  Generally. In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 415.050(b), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above base flood elevation. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in section 415.030(c)(9). 
(3)  New construction and substantial improvements. Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(b)  Minimum design criteria. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
(2)  The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(c)  Manufactured homes. 
(1)  All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
(2)  Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM on sites: 
a.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
b.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
c.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
d.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
(3)  Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(2) of this section, be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one foot above the base flood level; or 
b.

(Code 2006, § 415.060; Code 2008, § 415.060; Ord. No. 2082, 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 415.070. - Floodway. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 415.020(a) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply. 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. 
(2)  The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 415.050. 
(4)  In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state or other sources as set forth in section 415.050(b). 
(Code 2006, § 415.070; Code 2008, § 415.070; Ord. No. 2082, 2-18-2004)

(a)  Establishment of appeal board. The board of adjustment as established by the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Responsibility of appeal board. 
(1)  Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the floodplain management regulations is denied by the community development director or designate, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the board of adjustment. 
(2)  The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the community development director in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Further appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the circuit court of the county, state of state as provided in RSMo 89.110 . 
(d)  Floodplain management variance criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the following criteria: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(e)  Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that subsections (e)(2) through (6) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory of historic places or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structures continued historic designation. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
(f)  Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures. 
(1)  Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section. 
(2)  In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed. 
a.  Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM). 
b.  For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with section 415.050(d)(2). 
c.  The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with section 415.050(d)(1). All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
d.  Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 415.050(d)(4). 
e.  The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with section 415.060(a)(3). 
f.  The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provisions of section 415.070(2). No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood. 
g.  Equipment, machinery or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
h.  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
i.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
j.  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

CHAPTER 420. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 420.010. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and causes safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
(Code 2006, § 420.010; Code 2008, § 420.010; Ord. No. 1325, § 1, 7-24-1996) 
Sec. 420.020. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage. 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 2006, § 420.020; Code 2008, § 420.020; Ord. No. 1325, § 1.1, 7-24-1996) 
Sec. 420.030. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blight areas; and 
(7)  To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision to the circuit court. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(e)  In passing upon such applications, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

Sec. 420.160. - Specifications applicable to specific structures. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in sections 420.060 and 420.100, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection (2) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 420.140. 
(3)  Enclosed areas below the lowest floor. Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, and other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Manufactured homes must be anchored in accordance with state and local building code and FEMA guidelines. In the event that over-the-top frame ties to ground anchors are used, the following specific requirements (or their equivalent) shall be met: 
1.  Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of the manufactured home with two additional ties per side at the intermediate locations and manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side.

    In considering an application for a building or demolition permit or for a certificate of appropriateness, the downtown committee shall be guided in principle by the secretary of the interior's standards, as follows, in addition to any design guidelines in this chapter designating the landmark or historic district. Applications, standards for review and design guidelines shall be available in the community development department for distribution to the public. 
(1)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, is undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures are undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction is undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Code 2008, § 425.070; Ord. No. 3579, § 1, 3-9-2016) 
Sec. 425.080. - Design guidelines. 
    Design guidelines for applying the criteria for review of certificates of appropriateness shall, at a minimum, consider the following architectural criteria: 
(1)  Height. The height of any proposed alteration or construction should be compatible with the style and character of the landmark and with surrounding structures in a historic district. 
(2)  Proportions of windows and doors. The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark and with surrounding structures within a historic district. 
(3)  Relationship of building masses and spaces. The setback and relationship of a structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be compatible. 
(4)  Roof shape. The design of the roof should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark, and with surrounding structures in a historic district. 
(5)  Landscaping. Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural character and appearance of the landmark and of surrounding structures and landscapes in historic districts. 
(6)  Scale. The scale of the structure after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and character and with surrounding structures in a historic district. 
(7)  Directional expression. Facades in historic districts should blend with other structures with regard to directional expression. Structures in a historic district should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures. The directional expression of a landmark after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style and character. 
(8)  Architectural details. Architectural details including materials, colors, and textures should be treated so as to make a landmark compatible with its original architectural style and character and to preserve and enhance the architectural style or character of a landmark or historic district. 
(9)  Signage. The character of signs should be in keeping with the historic architectural character of a landmark or historic district. Character of a sign includes the number, size, area, scale, location, type, (e.g., off-site advertising signs and on-site business signs), letter size or style, and intensity and type of illumination. 
(10)  Minimum maintenance. Significant features should be kept in a condition of good repair and maintenance. All structural and mechanical systems should be maintained in a condition and state of repair that will prevent decay, deterioration or damage to significant features, or otherwise adversely affect the historic or architectural character of structures within a historic district. 
(Code 2008, § 425.080; Ord. No. 3579, § 1, 3-9-2016) 
Sec. 425.090. - Certificate of economic hardship. 
    Application for a certificate of economic hardship shall be made on a form prepared by the downtown committee only after a certificate of appropriateness has been denied. The downtown committee shall schedule a public hearing concerning the application and provide public notice and individual notice to the applicant, owners of record, and owners adjacent to the property in the same manner as in section 425.040, and any person may testify at the hearing concerning economic hardship. All testimony, objections thereto and rulings at such public hearing shall be taken down by the secretary of the downtown committee, or, if electronic tape recording equipment is available, by such electronic means. The downtown committee may solicit expert testimony or require that the applicant for a certificate of economic hardship make submissions concerning any or all of the following information before it makes a determination on the application: 
(1)  Estimate of the cost of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the downtown committee for changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness;

(c)  Minimum maintenance requirement. All buildings and structures designated by the city as "HP" Historic Preservation Overlay District shall be preserved against decay and deterioration and free from certain structural defects in the following manner, by the owner thereof or such other person or persons who may have the legal custody and control thereof shall repair such building if it is found to have any of the following defects:

109.7.5 Notice, sampling, and testing. If considered unsafe pursuant to section 109.7.4, the city shall post notice on the structure and send notice, by personal delivery or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the owner of record of the affected structure, or the owner's agent, and the person responsible for such violation, if different (together "responsible parties"). 
Notice shall instruct the responsible parties that the property has been declared unsafe and to contact the building official within 48 hours of receipt of such notice to discuss the process of testing and establishing a schedule for decontaminating the structure if testing reveals unsafe contamination levels as set forth in section 109.7.3. The notice shall also advise that failure to contact the building department within the time specified may result in the city requesting disconnection of utility services to ensure the affected inhabitable structure is not re-occupied until testing reveals no contamination or the property is decontaminated. If the owner or other responsible parties do not contact the building department within the time specified in the notice, the building official may take any actions necessary to discontinue trash, water or sewer service to ensure the structure is not re-occupied until decontamination is performed or subsequent testing reveals no contamination is present. 
The owner or other responsible parties must employ the services of a company listed by the city as qualified to perform testing and to analyze the samples. The owner or other responsible parties shall provide the results of the testing to the building official within two days of receipt of such testing results from the company performing the test. 
Testing methods shall be performed in accordance with the appropriate sections of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Voluntary Guidelines for Methamphetamine Laboratory Cleanup, August, 2009, and as amended. 
109.7.6 Test results; no contamination. If the testing reveals no unsafe contamination, upon receipt of such testing results, the building official shall remove the placard in accordance with section 108.4.1 and the property owner may proceed to apply for inspection and occupancy in accordance with section 109.7.10. Nothing herein relieves the responsible parties, and specifically the property owner, from complying with all other City Code requirements in order to qualify for an occupancy permit.

If testing reveals the presence of contamination in levels that exceed the standards set forth in section 109.7.3, the owner or other responsible parties will be required to hire a qualified contractor, approved by the building official and displaying the minimum requirements to decontaminate the structure and will advise the building official of the schedule for decontamination. At a minimum, to be qualified to perform decontamination contractors and all personnel must have completed the 40-hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Training (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910), and a clandestine drug lab assessment and decontamination course. 
The schedule for the work and evidence that the contractor has met the minimum training requirement must be submitted for approval to the building official within 14 days of the receipt of the testing showing unsafe contamination levels as set forth in section 109.7.3. Approval will be based solely on the timeliness of the schedule and the qualifications of the contractor. Approval or rejection of the schedule will be provided within 48 hours of submission. If rejected the owner or other responsible parties will be informed of the specific reasons for the rejection and will be required to amend the schedule or the proposed contractor. Decontamination shall be performed in accordance with the appropriate sections of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Voluntary Guidelines for Methamphetamine Laboratory Cleanup (August, 2009), and as amended. 
Nothing herein shall relieve the property owner or responsible parties from applying for and obtaining a building permit, electrical permit or any other required permit or required approval prior to decontaminating or repairing the structure. 
The building official may take any actions necessary to discontinue water, sewer or trash service until the decontamination is complete. 
109.7.8 City decontamination. If, for any property assessed pursuant section 109.7.4 to be unsafe, the owner or other responsible parties fail to contact the building department within 48 hours of receiving notice sent pursuant to section 109.7.5, or after contacting the building department, fail to submit the required testing under section 109.7.5 or fail to voluntarily abate that contamination pursuant to section 109.7.7, the building department may serve a notice of violation via personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, to all owners and occupants, lessees, lienholders, mortgagees, and all other persons having an interest in the location as shown by the recorder of deeds for the county (together "interested persons"). If any such interested persons' address is unknown and cannot be located, notice may be given by publication. The hearing and order, and testing provisions if applicable, shall all be in accordance with the abatement procedures of section 215.240(C)-(E). If at such hearing, the building official determines that the property owner's property is contaminated, the city shall order that the structure be decontaminated within a reasonable time by the owner or other interested persons, and if they fail to comply with such order, the city shall have authority to conduct or cause to be conducted the decontamination process. The property owner shall be responsible for the costs associated with testing and decontamination and upon failure to pay such costs, which shall be documented by the building official; the city shall place a lien on the structure in accordance with the procedures in chapter 215 concerning general nuisance abatement. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from proceeding, in lieu of these procedures, in accordance with chapter 520 of the Municipal Code. 
109.7.9 Post-decontamination sampling. When the owner or other interested persons arranges for decontamination, following the completion of the work, the owner or other interested persons will notify the building official that work is complete and provide to the city written test results as evidence that the property is compliant with this regulation. The post-remediation sampling and testing must be performed by a company, which meets the minimum requirements set forth in section 109.7.7, and done in accordance with the appropriate sections of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Voluntary Guidelines for Methamphetamine Laboratory Cleanup, August, 2009, and as amended. 
109.7.10 Final action. After the property has been decontaminated and the building official is in possession of evidence that the contamination levels are below the levels established by this regulation, the structure will be considered safe under sections 109.7.0-109.7.10 and suitable for performance of a full inspection for an occupancy permit. If utility service has been disconnected, the building official will take all actions necessary to restore service or authorize such service to be restored. The property owner or other interested persons shall be responsible for any re-connection fees. If the city was forced to decontaminate the property, an occupancy permit shall not be issued until those costs are reimbursed to the city. Nothing herein shall relieve the property owner or other interested persons from complying with all other applicable City Code requirements in order to be eligible for an occupancy permit.

The detonators shall be connected in straight series, straight parallel or parallel series. When firing with a hand-driven blasting machine, detonators shall be connected in straight series or parallel series, but detonators may be connected in straight parallel only when an adequate power supply is available. In every instance of electrical wiring, regardless of source of power, the director's instructions shall be observed. 
(10)  The power wires and leading wires shall be thoroughly insulated and kept from contact with any electrical conductor, air lines or pools of water or oil. 
(11)  The leg wires of detonators shall be kept short-circuited until connected into the circuit or to the leading wires. All bare connections shall be either taped or blocked up in position so as to prevent current leakage or entrance of stray currents. While making connections in the blast area, the leading wires shall be kept short-circuited at the power source end but not grounded and shall remain under the control of the blaster. They shall then be strung from the blast area toward the source of power to make the final connections for firing the blast. Before connecting the wires to the power circuit, the blaster shall make certain by a blasting galvanometer that continuous circuit exists in the wiring. If this test shows either a short circuit or no circuit, the reshunted leading wires shall be recoiled to the blast area before investigating for the trouble. Positive steps shall be taken to prevent lead wires from being dislodged and making contact with overhead high voltage electric power lines. Should accidental contact be made, the blaster shall prevent any person from touching the blasting device and he shall clear the area of all persons immediately. No person shall enter the area until the blaster has notified the owner of the power line and the latter has eliminated the danger of electric shock. 
(12)  A power circuit used for firing shall be controlled by a switch located at a safe distance, to be determined by the blaster. Such switch, when in actual use, shall be firmly fastened in position, thoroughly insulated against grounds and wholly enclosed in a tight box that shall be kept closed and locked at all times except while firing, and no person other than the blaster shall have access to the switch. The switch shall be provided with a short circuit in the "off" position and shall be so arranged that the box enclosure can be locked only when the switch is in the "off" position. 
(13)  When firing by means of a power circuit, the blasting circuit shall at all times be broken in at least one place by a gap of at least five feet on the incoming side of the switch, except during the firing operation. 
(14)  When firing with a blasting machine, the blasting machine shall be located at a safe distance to be determined by the blaster. 
(15)  When firing by means of a blasting machine, the leading wires shall be kept short-circuited until the shot is ready for firing and shall not be connected to the blasting machine until immediately before the time of firing and shall be disconnected from the blasting machine and short-circuited immediately after firing. 
(16)  Electric detonators and blasting circuits shall be tested only by means of a blasting galvanometer designed for this purpose. 
(17)  Before firing any blast, all means of access to the danger zone (the extent of that shall be determined by the blaster, but in no case to be closer to the explosion than the blaster himself), shall be effectively guarded to exclude all unauthorized personnel. The blaster shall then sound a warning of sufficient intensity and duration to be distinctly audible to all persons within the danger zone and all such persons shall then be examined by the blaster to make certain that all persons have retired therefrom to a place of safety. No blast shall be fired while any person is in the danger zone. The seismic pressure information is to be gathered from a point approximately 300 feet from the point of detonation or 100 feet from the nearest inhabited structure, whichever is closer. 
(18)  When the point of explosion is within 300 feet of a roadway, the blaster shall, just prior to the blast, designate a sufficient number of employees of the operator, each carrying a red warning flag, to stop all vehicular and pedestrian traffic on each possible route of travel within 350 feet of the point of explosion until the blast has been fired. 
(19)  No person shall return to the danger zone until permitted to do so by the blaster as announced by audible or visual signal. 
(20)  Immediately following the blast the area shall be examined by the blaster for evidence of misfired charges. 
(21)  All misfires shall be reported at once to the superintendent or manager who shall then determine the safe and proper method of disposal. The unexploded charge shall be detonated if such can be accomplished without risk of injury to personnel or damage to property. If repriming is necessary, any stemming present in the hole may be removed by a jet of water. The jetting tool should be of non-sparking metal, rubber or plastic. If electric blasting caps are used for in-the-hole initiation, an air jet should not be used. 
(22)  Drilling in any hole that is known to contain or have contained explosives is prohibited until complete neutralization is effected. 
(23)  A complete record shall be kept by the blaster showing all misfires and method of disposal. 
(24)  In case a charge fires but does not bring down the structure it is permissible to reload the bore hole, if in suitable condition, but only after the temperature of the hole has been reduced by water or otherwise to not more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 
(25)  Each blast hole shall be stemmed to the collar or to a point high enough to provide efficient confinement of the charge and to minimize the chance of injury to personnel from flying material. Block holes shall contain at least 85 percent of stemming material. For toe holes, the collar stemming shall in no case be less than one-third the depth of the hole. 
(26)  When electric blasting caps are transported in a motor vehicle, equipped with a radio transmitter, they shall either be in their original package or stored in a closed metal box that is lined with a cushioning material such as wood or sponge rubber. When the electric caps are being placed into or removed from the box, the transmitter circuit shall be disconnected. 
(27)  Unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by the director, all blasting operations shall be conducted at no less distance from any fixed or mobile radio transmitter than indicated in the following table: 
Transmitter Output in Watts Distance from Blasting Caps, in Feet 5-25 100 25-50 150 50-100 220 100-250 350 250-500 450 500-1,000 650 1,000-2,500 1,000 2,500-5,000 1,500 5,000-10,000 2,200 10,000-25,000 3,500 25,000-50,000 5,000 50,000-100,000 7,000  
When it can be demonstrated by means of approved tests that electric blasting may be carried out at lesser distances from the transmitter than required by the table shown, the director may allow a variation from the requirements of the table. 
(28)  In no case shall drilling be conducted closer than 25 feet to a loaded hole or a hole that is being loaded. 
(29)  Holes shall be checked prior to loading to determine depth and condition. Holes may be checked with a dolly or tamping block or by visual inspection with the aid of a mirror. After any explosives have been loaded, all measuring shall be done with a cloth tape or non-ferrous measuring device and lead plumb bob, or a wooden tamping pole or wooden dolly free of exposed metal parts. 
(30)  Under no circumstances shall the amount of explosives taken within 300 feet of a potential point of explosion exceed the amount estimated by the blaster as necessary for the blast. Such explosives shall be stacked in piles at least 25 feet from the nearest holes being loaded and at such distances apart, as provided in subsection (32) of this section, that any premature explosion will not be likely to propagate from one pile to another. 
(31)  The explosives containers, if any, shall be opened at the pile and carried up to the hole, one case or unit at a time for immediate loading or placed at a loading station not less than six feet from the hole except that not more than 100 pounds of explosives shall be allowed at the loading station at any one time. 
(32)  Explosives shall be distributed in such a manner that the distances from storage piles to the allowable maximum quantity of 100 pounds of explosives at the loading station or between such 100-pound loading station poles shall not be less than the quantities shown in the following quantity-distance table: 
Pounds of Explosives Distance Between Piles of Explosives in Feet Up to 50 21 100 25 200 32 300 37 400 41 500 44 750 50 1,000 55 1,500 64 2,000 70 2,500 75 5,000 96 10,000 123  
(33)  Drill holes shall not be sprung when they are less than 100 feet from the nearest hole containing explosives. Holes that have been sprung shall not be charged with explosives until the maximum temperature in any portion of such holes has been reduced to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Where possible, water is to be used for cooling purposes. 
(34)  When loading a blast primed with detonating fuse, the detonator required for firing blast shall not be brought within 50 feet of the hole area nor attached to the detonating fuse until all persons, except the blaster and his assistants, have been cleared from the danger zone. 
(35)  In all blasting where the firing of any one hole is likely to break into or damage another hole in the vicinity or where the firing of any hole may propagate the charge in a loaded hole in the vicinity, all holes which have been loaded shall be included and fired in the blast. 
(36)  Water standing in blast holes should be bailed out, if possible, or the holes shall be loaded with an explosive of adequate water resistance. 
(37)  Blasting crews shall consist of the minimum number of experienced men and women to do the work in an efficient manner and should be organized carefully and each person assigned to definite tasks to avoid confusion. 
(38)  A blast shall be planned before the loading is started. The planned charge for each hole shall be recorded prior to the blast. 
(39)  The condition of each hole to be loaded and the amount, height, and position of the explosives charge placed in the hole shall be recorded on a loading chart prior to the blast. 
(40)  Members of loading crews engaged in loading blast holes should be prohibited from wearing hobnail or steel-plated shoes to avoid striking sparks on rocks. 
(41)  Large dynamite cartridges may be dropped in blast holes only when the hole is free of obstructions to the depth at which the cartridge is to rest. 
(42)  Large dynamite cartridges shall not be dropped in blast holes containing excessive water until the charge is above the water level. 
(43)  Large dynamite cartridges that have been wedged in a blast hole shall not be tamped with a dolly. After pouring water into the hole, attempts to dislodge or pierce them shall be made with a spear-shaped wooden tamping block or a small-diameter wooden pole. 
(44)  Rough or ragged holes and holes partly closed by an obstruction that cannot be readily removed shall be loaded with cartridged dynamite lowered with a rope, with free running powder or dynamite cut in small pieces. 
(45)  When loading a long line of holes with more than one loading crew, the crews shall be separated by the greatest practical distance which can be maintained as the loading operations progress and that is consistent with efficient operation and supervision of the crews. Every effort shall be made to keep the loading crews a minimum of 25 feet apart and to prevent the simultaneous loading of adjacent holes. 
(46)  Excessively large amounts of explosives shall not be delivered to the loading area at one time. If deliveries of explosives are made by truck, the quantity permitted at or near the loading operations shall be limited to one truck load. Other trucks loaded with explosives shall wait or be unloaded in separate safe places away from the loading operation. 
(47)  Explosives should be delivered first to the holes farthest from the truck to avoid driving or walking among piles of explosives. 
(48)  Explosives in excess of immediate requirements, when removed from the main storage magazine and delivered in the vicinity of a blasting operation, shall be stored in a Class II magazine. 
(49)  The required stemming or tamping material shall be placed by each hole before the delivery of explosives to the holes is started. Stemming material shall be screened or free from excessively coarse pieces. 
(50)  Stemming shall be placed in each hole to avoid damage to the detonating fuse or leg wires of electric detonators. 
(51)  A single hole or any number of holes in a row should not be fired when adjacent to or near one or more other holes that are loaded and that are not intended to be fired. 
(52)  All detonating fuses shall be covered with adequate stemming where physically possible to reduce noise. 
(53)  The detonating fuse shall extend from the hole a distance of one or two feet more than sufficient to compensate for any subsidence, should be drawn taut and made secure on the top where it will not interfere with loading operations or come in contact with explosives on the ground. 
(54)  The detonating fuse shall be checked each time before stemming material is used to see that it has not been broken; if it has, it shall be repaired before proceeding. 
(55)  When a detonating fuse is used, main or trunk line splices shall be factory splices or tight knots. No splices or knots shall be used in the drill hole. 
(56)  All branch line connections and all connections in the main line other than splices shall be tight and at right angles. 
(57)  The main or trunk line shall be laid out free of kinks or coils and all connections shall be inspected before firing the blast. 
(58)  When connecting an electric blasting cap to detonating fuse, a connector for the purpose shall be used in accordance with the director's instructions. The cap may also be securely taped to the detonating fuse. 
(59)  Caps shall not be brought to the loading area nor attached to the detonating fuse until all is in readiness to fire the blast. 
(60)  Plain detonating fuse may be used for trunk lines or in shallow drill holes, but reinforced or wire-protected types shall be used in deep or ragged holes. 
(61)  Toe hole blasting is defined as the removing of ledges or high bottoms that remain after a main or primary shot or blast using moderate quantities of explosives loaded in small diameter holes. In toe hole blasting, the charge of explosives shall be pushed to the end of the hole with a wooden pole using care not to block the hole or suitable free running blasting agents may be blown into the hole with an approved pneumatic loader. 
(62)  Secondary blasting is defined as the reduction of oversize material by the use of explosives to facilitate shovel operations or to be accompanied by the crusher. It shall include mud-capping and blockholing. In secondary blasting, wherever practicable, oversize fragments shall be reduced to shovel or crusher size by use of the drop-ball method, except as otherwise directed by the director. 
(63)  Charges of explosives shall be confined in all cases (drill holes) by suitable, inert stemming material. 
(64)  No person, except the blaster and any others directly engaged in loading block holes, shall be permitted within the immediate area while loading is being performed. Loading of any block hole shall be completed in one continuous operation including insertion of the primer and the stem. 
(65)  The use of explosives for blasting purposes within the limitations of these rules and regulations shall only be undertaken with quantities of explosives not in excess of those permitted by this section and except as further restricted by other requirements of these rules and regulations. 
(66)  All primary shots shall be fired with quantities of explosives not in excess of those permitted by these rules. 
(67)  In all blasting operations, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the maximum peak particle velocity of any one of three mutually perpendicular components of the ground motion in the vertical and horizontal directions shall not exceed two inches per second. 
a.  When blasting operations are contemplated which would result in ground vibrations that would have a particle velocity of any one of three mutually perpendicular components of the ground, motion in the vertical and horizontal directions shall not exceed two inches per second. 
b.  When blasting operations are contemplated which would result in ground vibrations that would have a particle velocity of any one of three mutually perpendicular components in excess of two inches per second, blasting operations may proceed after receiving written consent from the property owners affected and the director. 
c.  Blasting operations without instrumentation will be considered as being within the limits set forth in this subsection (67) if at a specified location on at least five blasts instrumentation has shown that the maximum peak particle velocity at the specified location is 50 percent or less of the limit set forth in this subsection (67), provided that, for all future blasts, the scaled distance is equal to or greater than the scaled distance for the instrumental blast. The term "scaled distance" means actual distance in feet divided by the square root of the maximum explosive weight in pounds that is detonated per delay period for delay intervals of eight milliseconds or greater. If delay intervals less than eight milliseconds are employed or if instantaneous blasting is employed, scaled distance shall be computed by dividing actual distance in feet by the square root of the total explosive weight in pounds. 
(68)  When ground transmission characteristics have been determined by instrumentation using either an acceleragraph or seismograph, and in a manner satisfactory to the director, the allowable quantity distance relations shall be determined from the formula: 
(50/D) 2 C 2 K=3 
Where: 
D = distance from blast area in feet 
C = quantity of explosives detonated instantaneously, in pounds 
K = ground transmission constant 
(69)  Without approval method of instrumentation, the quantities of explosives used in any primary blasting shall not exceed the following:

(70)  When ground motion characteristics for any given quarry operation have been determined by the director, based on instrumentation data submitted by the operator, the allowable quantity-distance relations between amount of explosives used in primary blasting and distance from blast area shall be determined from the accepted results of instrumentation at the given blasting operation for the various weights of explosives. The maximum amplitudes shall not exceed those given in subsection (67) of this section. 
(71)  In blasting, the minimum allowable sound pressure beyond quarry property lines resulting from quarry blasting shall not exceed 100 decibels. This sound pressure information is to be gathered from a point approximately 300 feet downwind from the point of detonation or 100 feet from the nearest residence, whichever is closer.

Sec. 510.300. - Buildings used for mixing of blasting agents-Location. 
    Buildings or other facilities used for mixing blasting agents shall be located, with respect to inhabited buildings, passenger railroads and public highways, in accordance with the American Table of Distance, set forth in section 510.500. 
(1)  Any oxidizer stored at a closer distance to the blasting agent storage area than as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall be added to the quantity of blasting agents to calculate the total quantity involved for application of the aforementioned table. 
(2)  Minimum intra-plant separation (distances between mixing units and the oxidizer) storage areas and blasting agent storage areas shall be determined by competent persons and these distances shall be approved by the director. 
(Code 1988, § 10-81; Code 2006, § 515.310; Code 2008, § 510.310; Ord. No. 1040, § 1(.240), 8-9-1989) 
Sec. 510.310. - Same-Construction. 
(a)  Buildings used for the mixing of blasting agents shall conform to the requirements of this section, unless otherwise specifically approved by the director. 
(1)  Buildings should preferably be of non-combustible construction or sheet metal on wood studs. 
(2)  The layout of the mixing building shall be such as to provide physical separation between the finished product storage and the mixing and packaging operation. 
(3)  Floors in storage areas and in the processing plant should be of concrete. Isolated fuel storage shall be provided to avoid contact between molten oxidizer and fuel in case of fire. 
(4)  The building shall be well ventilated. 
(5)  Heat shall be provided exclusively from a unit outside the building. 
(b)  The design of the mixer should minimize the possibility of frictional heating, compaction, and, especially, confinement. Open mixers are preferable to enclosed mixers. Bearings and gears should be protected against the accumulation of oxidizer dust. All surfaces should be accessible for cleaning. Mixing and packaging equipment should be constructed of materials compatible with the fuel-oxidizer composition. Mobile equipment, such as ready-mix concrete trucks, shall not be used for blending fuels with oxidizers while in transit on public highways. The provisions of this section shall be considered when determining blasting agent composition. The sensitivity of the blasting agent shall be determined by means of a No. 8 test blasting cap at regular intervals and after every change in ingredients or composition, or as may be requested by the director. 
(c)  Oxidizers of small particle size, such as crushed prills or fines, may be more sensitive and hazardous than the ordinary prills and should be handled with greater care. 
(d)  No liquid fuel with higher volatility than that of No. 2 diesel fuel (minimum flash point of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ASTM closed-up procedure) shall be used. 
(e)  Crude oil and crankcase oil should not be used because they may contain light ends that offer increased vapor-explosion hazards or gritty particles that tend to sensitize the resulting blasting agent. 
(f)  If solid fuels are used, they shall be chosen so as to minimize dust-explosion hazard. 
(g)  Metal dusts (aluminum powder, etc.), peroxides, chlorates, or perchlorates shall not be used unless such operations are conducted in a manner approved by the director. 
(h)  Unusual compositions shall not be attempted except under the supervision of competent personnel equipped to determine the overall hazard of the resulting compositions. 
(i)  All electrical switches, controls, motors and lights, if allocated in the mixing room, should conform to the requirements of article 502, class II, division 2 of the electrical code of the city; otherwise they should be located outside the mixing room. The frame of the mixer and all other equipment that may be used shall be electrically bonded and provided with a continuous path to the ground. 
(j)  Washdown facilities should be provided. An automatic water-deluge system with adequate capacity is recommended to protect mixers and the finished-explosives storage area in the plant. Floors shall be constructed so as to eliminate open floor drains and piping into which molten materials could flow and be confined in case of fire. The floors and equipment of the mixing and packaging room shall be washed down frequently to prevent accumulation of oxidizers or fuels and other sensitizers. The entire mixing and packaging plant shall be washed down periodically to prevent excessive accumulation of dust. 
(k)  Smoking or open flames shall not be permitted in or within 50 feet of any building or facility used for the mixing of blasting agents. 
(l)  Empty oxidizer bags shall be disposed of daily in a safe manner. 
(m)  Not more than one day's production of blasting agents or the limit determined by the American Table of Distances (section 510.500), whichever is less, shall be permitted in or near the mixing and packaging plant or area. Larger quantities shall be stored in separate warehouses or magazines.

Notes to American Table of Distances for Storage of Explosives: 
Note 1. "Barricaded" means that a building containing explosives is effectually screened from a magazine, building, railway or highway, either by a natural barricade or by an artificial barricade of such height that a straight line from the top of any sidewall of the building containing explosives to the eave line of any magazine or building or to a point 12 feet above the center of a railway or highway, will pass through such intervening natural or artificial barricade. 
Note 2. "Natural barricade" means natural features of the ground, such as hills or timber of sufficient density that the surrounding exposures which require protection cannot be seen from the magazine, when the trees are bare of leaves. 
Note 3. "Artificial barricade" means an artificial mound or riveted wall of earth of a minimum thickness of three feet. 
Note 4. When a building containing explosives is not barricaded, the distances shown in the table shall be doubled. 
Note 5. When two or more storage magazines are located on the same property, each magazine must comply with the minimum distances specified from inhabited buildings, railways and highways, and in addition they should be separated from each other by not less than the distances shown for "Separation of Magazines," except that the quantity of explosives contained in cap magazines shall govern regarding the spacing of the cap magazines from magazines containing other explosives. If any two or more magazines are separated from each other by less than the specified "Separation of Magazines" distances, then such two or more magazines, as a group, must be considered as one magazine, and the total quantity of explosives stored in such group must be treated as if stored in a single magazine located on the site of any magazine of the group, and must comply with the minimum distances specified from other magazines, inhabited buildings, railways and highways. 
Note 6. The permanent storage of more than 300,000 pounds of commercial explosives in one magazine or in a group of magazines that is considered as one magazine is not permitted except by specific approval of the director. 
Note 7. This table applies only to the manufacture and permanent storage of commercial explosives. It is not applicable to transportation of explosives or any handling or temporary storage necessary or incident thereto. It is not intended to apply to bombs, projectiles, or other heavily encased explosives. For storage in connection with transportation, see sections 510.150-510.180. 
Note 8. All types of blasting of caps in strengths through No. 8 cap shall be rated at 11/2 pounds of explosives per 1,000 caps. For strength higher than No. 8 cap, consult the director.

CHAPTER 515. - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

Sec. 515.010. - Source; adoption. 
    These sediment and erosion control regulations for urban development, as proposed by the St. Charles Soil and Water Conservation District, present a reasonable method for controlling sediment and erosion and are hereby revised and adopted as the sediment and erosion control regulations of the city. 
(Code 1988, § 6-151; Code 2006, § 520.010; Code 2008, § 515.010; Ord. No. 1125, § 1, 9-18-1991) 
Sec. 515.020. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to control soil erosion on land that is undergoing development for non-agricultural uses and to preserve the natural terrain and waterways of land within the city. Soil erosion scars the land and creates sediment that clogs storm sewers and road ditches, chokes streams, and creates silt lakes, all of which pose a threat to public health and safety. The provisions in this chapter are intended to provide a natural community environment, to prevent soil erosion and to reduce costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, water conveyance systems, roads and embankments. Application of the regulations in this chapter will effectively control soil erosion and sedimentation. 
(b)  Scope of authority. Any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to develop land within the city shall apply to the designated official for approval of required erosion control plans and issuance of a grading permit as specified in this chapter. 
(c)  Performance guarantee. Upon approval of the required erosion control plan and the issuance of a grading permit, the designated official shall require the developer to post an escrow agreement, lender's agreement, or certified check in the amount of all work to be done under the erosion control plan. Ninety percent of the funds will be released after all erosion control measures are in place and approved by the designated official. Ten percent will be held until the public improvements are accepted by the city to insure that the erosion control measures are maintained. If there are no public improvements (site plans) the final ten percent will be held until released by the designated official. 
(Code 1988, § 10-152; Code 2006, § 520.020; Code 2008, § 515.020; Ord. No. 1125, § 2, 9-18-1991)

l.  A statement from the property owner or his agent assuming full responsibility for the performance of the operation as stated in the application. This statement shall also contain assurance that all city property or roads will be adequately protected. 
(2)  The proposed phasing of development of the site, including clearing, rough grading and construction, and final grading and landscaping. Phasing should identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas and the sequence of clearing, installation of temporary sediment control measures, installation of storm drainage, paving streets and parking areas, and establishment of temporary and permanent vegetative cover. The designated official may waive specific requirements for the content of submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to show that the work will comply with the objectives and principles of these regulations. 
(b)  Sediment and erosion control plan approval. 
(1)  The sediment and erosion control plan must define the measures to be taken to meet erosion control principles and standards as defined in these regulations. The plan must be designed with the goal of assuring that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of the 15-year (frequency), 20-minute (duration) or less. The plan shall include appropriate best management practices (BMPs) per the most recent "Protecting Water Quality: A Field Guide to Erosion, Sediment and Stormwater Best Management Practices for Development Sites in Missouri and Kansas" guide or other manual or method approved by the city engineer. 
(2)  Comments. When a plan is submitted by the designated official to the soil and water conservation district, the district may make comments and recommendations.

a.  Erosion and sedimentation control. 
b.  Soil use limitations. 
c.  Environmental considerations. 
(c)  Principles and standards. 
(1)  All excavation, grading, or filling shall have a finished grade not to exceed a 3:1 slope (33 percent). Steeper grades may be approved by the designated official if the excavation is through rock or the excavation or the fill is adequately protected (a designated head wall or toe wall may be required). Retaining walls that exceed a height of four feet shall require the construction of safety guards as identified in the appropriate sections of the building codes as adopted by the city and must be approved by the public works director.

The design shall be approved by the designated official before improvements begin. Temporary siltation control measures (structural) shall be maintained until vegetative cover is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. 
(3)  Where natural vegetation is removed during grading, vegetation shall be reestablished in such a density as to prevent erosion. Permanent type grasses shall be established as soon as possible or during the next seeding period after grading has been completed. 
(4)  When grading operations are completed or suspended for more than 30 days, permanent grass must be established at sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. Between permanent grass seeding periods, temporary cover shall be provided according to the designated official's recommendation or approval. All finished grades (areas not to be disturbed by future improvement) in excess of 20 percent slopes (5:1) shall be mulched and tacked at the rate of 100 pounds per 1,000 square feet when seeded. 
(5)  Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after grading. Unvegetated open channels shall be designed so that gradients result in velocities of two feet per second (fps) or less. Open channels shall be designed so that gradients result in velocities of two fps or less. Open channels with velocities more than two fps and less than five fps shall be established in permanent vegetation by use of commercial erosion control blankets or lined with rock riprap or concrete or other suitable materials as approved by the designated official. Detention basins, diversion, or other appropriate structures shall be constructed to prevent velocities above five fps. (Refer to sections 515.070 through 515.110.) 
(6)  The adjoining ground to development sites (lots) shall be provided with protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt from erosion, and any other consequences of erosion. Runoff water from developed areas (parking lots, paved sites and buildings) above the area to be developed shall be directed to diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters or underground outlet systems. A three-foot buffer strip shall be maintained at the property line in an undisturbed condition unless otherwise approved. Sufficiently anchored straw bales may be temporarily substituted with the approval of the designated official. 
(7)  Development along natural watercourses shall comply in all respects with the requirements of chapter 410, article VI, pertaining to protection of natural watercourses. 
(8)  All lots shall be seeded and mulched at the rates defined in section 515.060 or sodded before an occupancy permit shall be issued except that a temporary occupancy permit may be issued by the public works director in cases of undue hardship because of unfavorable ground conditions.

Sec. 515.050. - Inspection; violation and penalties; appeals. 
(a)  Inspections. By applying for a grading permit, the applicant consents to the city inspecting the development of a site that is subject to a sediment and erosion control plan and all work in progress (the "work"). Inspection records as required by the state department of natural resources land disturbance permit may be requested and available for review during normal business hours by city staff. 
(b)  Corrections. 
(1)  The city may inspect the work (the "initial inspection") and, if the inspector determines that there is a potential failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter, notify the permittee or the permittee's representative (the "permittee") in writing of the items that need to be corrected (the "notice to correct"). The notice to correct shall at a minimum state the nature of the non-compliance, any practice or approved plan deficiency, required corrective action, and compliance time. The time limit for making the corrections shall be a minimum of 30 days unless, in the opinion of the public works director, an imminent hazard or emergency exists, in which injury to persons or significant property damage is imminent (an "emergency"), at which time the city shall immediately notify the permittee of such hazard or emergency and shall require corrective work to begin immediately. 
(2)  The permittee, if not present on the site during the initial inspection, shall have a reasonable opportunity to accompany the city's inspector on a subsequent site visit (the "site visit") to discuss the items in the notice to correct. A permittee desiring to accompany the inspector on a site visit shall make himself available for the site visit no later than ten days of the date of issuance of the notice to correct; failure to do so will waive the site visit. After any site visit, the inspector may amend the notice to correct to reflect any agreements by the inspector and the permittee at the site visit pertaining to corrective action or compliance time and shall send such amended notice to correct to the permittee. 
(3)  Upon the sooner of: 
a.  The permittee's completion of the corrections set forth in the notice of correction and notification of the inspector of same; or 
b.  The expiration of the time for compliance set forth in the notice to correct; 
the public works director or his designee (the "public works director") shall cause the work to be re-inspected to determine the status of compliance (the "compliance inspection"). If the compliance inspection shows that the items on the notice to correct have been corrected, the inspector shall notify the permittee of same. Written notification that the matter is corrected and the matter is closed may be provided to the permittee upon his request. If the compliance inspection reveals a failure to correct some or all of the items on the notice to correct, the public works director shall notify the permittee of the deficient items that were not corrected in violation of this chapter. The city may then proceed with all remedies for such violations set forth in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Violations. All persons failing to comply with such notice to correct within the time period stated therein shall be deemed in violation of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except in the case of an emergency, failure of the city to give the permittee an opportunity to accompany the inspector on a site visit as set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall prohibit any further enforcement action or penalty being imposed by the city on the permittee with respect to any notice to correct arising from such initial inspection. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the city's ability to immediately respond to complaints or concerns regarding erosion or stormwater control for compliance with its MS4 permit. 
(d)  Penalties. Anyone violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to the general penalty provisions of section 100.190. In addition to the penalties hereinabove authorized and established, the city attorney is authorized to take such other actions at law or in equity as may be required to halt, terminate, remove, or otherwise eliminate any violation of this chapter. The public works director, subject to the appeal procedure set forth in subsection (e) of this section, may seize any performance guarantee established to ensure compliance with this chapter including bringing the site into compliance with the approved sediment and erosion control plan. 
(e)  Appeals. 
(1)  Any aggrieved person, firm, corporation, or any governmental officer, department, board or bureau may appeal a final decision of the public works director before the board of appeals as established and in conformance with the requirements of the applicable ordinance of the city, subject to the further requirements of this section. 
(2)  Grounds for granting a variance. The board of appeals may grant variances from this chapter where there is alleged error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the designated official or his assignee and where the applicant would be subject to undue hardship. Undue hardship is not considered the loss of possible advantage, economic loss or gain, or mere inconvenience to the applicant. Notwithstanding anything herein, no variance shall be granted where the requested variance would: 
a.  Be in violation of the federal Clean Water Act or other federal law or regulation, or any state law or regulation; or 
b.  Cause the city to violate any enforcement duties under its MS4 permit or the Clean Water Act. 
(3)  Appeals from decisions of the board of appeals shall be to the circuit court in conformance with the requirements of the applicable ordinances of the city and state statutes.

Sec. 520.050. - Building inspector; procedure and notice. 
(a)  The building inspector or his designee, or such other official as may be appointed by the city from time to time, shall be responsible for enforcement of this chapter. 
(b)  The building inspector shall have the duty under this chapter to: 
(1)  Inspect, or cause to be inspected, as often as may be necessary, all residential, institutional, assembly, commercial, industrial, garage, special or miscellaneous occupancy buildings for determining whether any conditions exist that render such place to be a dangerous building when he has reasonable grounds to believe that any such building is dangerous. 
(2)  Inspect any building, wall or structure about which complaints are filed by any person to the effect that a building, wall or structure is or may be existing in violation of this chapter, and the building inspector determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such building is dangerous. 
(3)  Inspect any building, wall or structure reported by the fire or police departments as probably existing in violation of this chapter. 
(4)  Notify the owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee, agent and all other persons having an interest in the building or structure, as shown by the land records of the recorder of deeds of the county, of any building or structure found by him to be a dangerous building or structure within the standards set forth in section 520.020. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or if service cannot be had by either of these modes of service, then service may be had by publication in a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices for two consecutive weeks. The notice required shall state that: 
a.  The owner must vacate, vacate and repair or vacate and demolish the building and clean up the lot or property on which the building is located in accordance with the terms of the notice and this chapter. 
b.  The occupant or lessee must vacate the building or have it repaired in accordance with the notice and remain in possession. 
c.  The mortgagee, agent or other persons having an interest in the building as shown by the land records of the recorder of deeds of the county may, at his own risk, repair, vacate or demolish the building and clean up the property or have such work done; provided that any person notified under this subsection to repair, vacate or demolish any building or clean up the property shall be given such reasonable time, not exceeding 30 days, to commence the required work. 
(5)  The notice provided for in this section shall state a description of the building or structure deemed dangerous, a statement of the particulars that make the building or structure a dangerous building, a statement indicating that as a dangerous building, the building or structure constitutes a nuisance and an order requiring the designated work to be commenced within the time provided for in subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
(6)  Report in writing to the city building official the non-compliance with any notice to vacate, repair, demolish, clean up the property or upon the failure to proceed continuously with the work without unnecessary delay. 
(7)  Appear at all hearings conducted by the building official and testify as to the condition of dangerous buildings. 
(8)  Immediately report to the building official concerning any building found by him to be inherently dangerous and that he determined to be a nuisance per se. The building official may direct that such building be marked or posted with a written notice reading substantially as follows: 
"This building has been found to be a dangerous building by the building inspector. This notice is to remain on this building or property until it is repaired, vacated or demolished and the property is cleaned up in accordance with the notice that has been given the owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee or agent of this building, and all other persons having an interest in the building as shown by the land records of the recorder of deeds of the county. It is unlawful to remove this notice until such notice is complied with." 
Provided, however, that the order by the building official and the posting of the notice shall not be construed to deprive all persons entitled thereto by this chapter to the notice and hearing prescribed herein. 
(Code 2006, §§ 525.050, 525.060; Code 2008, §§ 520.050, 520.060) 
Sec. 520.060. - Powers and duties of building official. 
(a)  The building official shall enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  The building official shall have the powers and duties pursuant to this chapter to: 
(1)  Supervise all inspections required by this chapter, and cause the building inspector to make inspections and perform all the duties required of him by this chapter. Upon receiving a complaint or report from any source that a dangerous building exists in the city, the building official shall cause an inspection to be made forthwith. If the building official deems it necessary to the performance of his duties and responsibilities imposed herein, the building official may request an inspection and report be made by any other city department or retain services of an expert whenever the building official deems such service necessary. 
(2)  Upon receipt of a report from the building inspector indicating failure by the owner, lessee, occupant, mortgagee, agent or other persons having an interest in the building to commence work of reconditioning or demolition within the time specified by this chapter or upon failure to proceed continuously with work without unnecessary delay, hold a hearing giving the affected parties full and adequate hearing on the matter. 
(3)  Give written notice of the hearing, either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or, if service cannot be had by either of those modes of service, then by publication in a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices, at least ten days in advance of the hearing date, to the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent and all other persons having an interest in the building as shown by the land records of the recorder of deeds of the county, who may appear before the building official on the date specified in the notice to show cause why the building or structure reported to be a dangerous building should not be repaired, vacated or demolished in accordance with the statement of particulars set forth in the building inspector's notice as provided herein. Any party may be represented by counsel and all parties shall have an opportunity to be heard. 
(4)  Make written findings of fact from the evidence offered at the hearing as to whether or not the building in question is a dangerous building within the terms of section 520.020. 
(5)  If the evidence supports a finding based upon competent and substantial evidence that the building or structure is a dangerous building, and a nuisance and detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the city, issue an order based upon its findings of fact commanding the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent or other persons having an interest in the building as shown by the land records of the recorder of deeds of the county to repair, vacate or demolish any building found to be a dangerous building and to clean up the property, provided that any person so notified shall have the privilege of either repairing or vacating and repairing the building, if such repair will comply with the ordinances of the city or may vacate and demolish the dangerous building at his own risk to prevent the acquiring by the city of the lien against the land where the dangerous building stands. If the evidence does not support a finding that a building or structure is a dangerous building, or a nuisance or detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the city, no order shall be issued. 
(6)  If the owner, occupant, mortgagee or lessee fails to comply with the order within 30 days, cause such building or structure to be repaired, vacated or demolished and the property cleaned up as the facts may warrant. If the building official or other designated officer issues an order whereby the building or structure is demolished, secured, or repaired, or the property is cleaned up, the cost of performance shall be certified to the city clerk or officer in charge of finance, who shall cause a special tax bill or assessment therefor against the property to be prepared and collected by the city collector or other official collecting taxes, unless the building or structure is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the city and such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in RSMo 429.010 to 429.360. Except as provided in section 520.070, at the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten years. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner and shall also be a lien on the property until paid. The tax bill or assessment shall bear interest at a rate of eight percent per annum until paid.

Sec. 520.070. - Insurance proceeds; how handled. 
(a)  If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion or other casualty loss, the following procedure is established for the payment of up to 25 percent of the insurance proceeds, as set forth in this subsection. This subsection shall apply only to a covered claim payment that is in excess of 50 percent of the face value of the policy covering a building or other structure. 
(1)  The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to 25 percent of the covered claim payment, and shall pay such monies to the city to deposit into an interest-bearing account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall maintain priority over any obligation under this chapter. 
(2)  The city shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds received under subsection (a)(1) of this section to the insured or as the terms of the policy and endorsements thereto provide within 30 days after receipt of such insurance monies, unless the city has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions of section 520.060(b)(6). If the city has proceeded under the provisions of section 520.060(b)(6), all monies in excess of that necessary to comply with the provisions of section 520.060(b)(6) for the removal, securing, repair and cleanup of the building or structure and the lot on which it is located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured. 
(b)  If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten years. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property and a personal debt against the property owners until paid. 
(c)  This section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and structures. 
(d)  This section does not make the city a party to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance policy. 
(e)  The building official may certify that in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim payment under subsection (a) of this section that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In this event, the building official shall issue a certificate within 30 days after receipt of proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without the deduction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other person making the claim to provide the insurance company with the written certificate provided for in this subsection.

    Any person desiring to conduct facilities work within public rights-of-way must first apply for and obtain a permit, in addition to any other building permit, license, easement or authorization required by law, unless such facilities work must be performed on an emergency basis; then the person conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify the city of the location of the work and apply for the required permit by the third business day following the commencement of the facilities work. 
(1)  All applications for permits shall be submitted to the city engineer.

(3)  Each such application shall be accompanied by payment of fees as designated in this chapter. 
(4)  The city engineer shall review each application for a permit and, upon determining that the applicant has authority to perform the desired facilities work and that the applicant has submitted all necessary information and has paid the appropriate fee, shall issue the permit, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section. 
(5)  It is the intention of the city that disruption of the public rights-of-way should be minimized. Upon receipt of an application for a permit, the city engineer shall do the following: 
a.  Evaluate the degree of excavation necessary to perform the facilities work in the rights-of-way and determine whether the excavation will be more than minor in nature. If the applicant can show to the city engineer's reasonable satisfaction that the facilities work involves any of the following: 
1.  No significant disruption or damage to the public rights-of-way; or 
2.  Time sensitive maintenance; 
then the city engineer shall grant the permit without delay provided that if the permit is not issued in ten business days, the aggrieved party may appeal as provided in subsection (9) of this section; and 
b.  For circumstances where the city engineer determines that there will be significant excavation of the public rights-of-way and no exemption under subsection (5)a of this section or any other provision of this section applies, the city engineer may, consistent with the time requirements set forth in this section and in the permit, direct permit holders performing facilities work in the same area to consult on how they may schedule and coordinate their work to accomplish the goal of this section. 
(6)  Each permit shall include projected commencement and termination dates or, if such dates are unknown at the time the permit is issued, a provision requiring the permit holder to provide the city engineer with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are determined; length of public rights-of-way; number of road crossings; information regarding scheduling and coordination of facilities work if applicable; and location of facilities. 
(7)  The city engineer may include in permits such conditions and requirements as are reasonably necessary to protect structures and facilities in the public rights-of-way from damage and for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way, structures and facilities and for the protection of the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(8)  The city engineer may deny a permit application for the following reasons if deemed in the public's interest: 
a.  Undisputed past due fees from prior permits; 
b.  Failure to return the right-of-way to its previous condition under previous permits; 
c.  Undue disruption to existing utilities, transportation or city use; 
d.  Area is environmentally sensitive as defined by state or federal statute; 
e.  Failure to provide required information; and 
f.  The applicant is in violation of the provisions of this chapter. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (8)c and (8)d of this section, the city engineer will cooperate with the applicant to identify alternative routes which most nearly match the routes requested by the applicant for the placement of facilities. 
(9)  Appeals. 
a.  The applicant may appeal any final decision of the city engineer to the city administrator, which appeal shall be acted upon by the city administrator within five business days; and 
b.  If denied by the city administrator, the applicant may then appeal to the board of aldermen, which shall consider the appeal at its next regular meeting. 
(10)  Applicant must pay fees. 
a.  Any fees/escrows collected pursuant to this section will be used only to reimburse the city for its actual incurred cost of managing the rights-of-way and will not be used to generate revenue to the city above such costs. 
b.  Fees/escrows are changed to recover the city's actual costs for an applicant's facilities work in the right-of-way including the costs of processing permits, inspections and administration of this chapter, excluding legal fees relating to the interpretation or enforcement of this chapter including all such appeals. 
(11)  Applicant subject to other laws, police power. 
a.  An applicant shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police powers of the city, including, but not limited to, all powers regarding zoning, supervision of construction, and control of public rights-of-way. 
b.  No action or omission of the city shall operate as a future waiver of any rights of the city under this chapter. 
c.  The city shall have the maximum plenary authority to regulate applications, permits and facilities work as may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible. Except where rights are expressly granted or waived by a permit, they are reserved, whether or not expressly enumerated. This chapter may be amended from time to time and in no event shall this chapter be considered a contract between the city and an application such that the city would be prohibited from amending any provision hereof.

(3)  The city engineer shall have full access to all portions of facilities work and may issue stop work orders and corrective orders to prevent unauthorized work.

Such orders may be enforced by equitable action in the circuit court, and if the city prevails in such case, the person involved in the facilities work shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney's fees, in enforcing such orders, in addition to any and all penalties established in this chapter. 
(4)  Any person who engages in facilities work in the public rights-of-way and who has not received a valid permit from the city shall be subject to all requirements of this chapter. Except in those instances where facilities work must be performed on an emergency basis, the city may, in its discretion, at any time until a permit is secured, order the facilities work stopped and do any of the following: require such person to apply for a permit within ten days of receipt of a written notice from the city that a permit is required; require such person to remove its property and restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to the city; or take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law including, but not limited to, filing for and seeking damages.

(a)  Performance bond. 
(1)  Prior to any facilities work in the public rights-of-way, an applicant shall establish in the city's favor a performance bond in any amount determined by non-discriminatory regulations promulgated by the city engineer as necessary to ensure the applicant's faithful performance of the facilities work. Differences in bond requirements, including provisions for self-insurance or provisions for a single continuing bond where facilities work is conducted by the same applicant under numerous permits, may be established by regulation based on the extent or nature of the facilities work and the past performance of the applicant. In lieu of a performance bond, the applicant may provide an acceptable substitute with the approval of the city engineer. 
(2)  In the event an applicant fails to complete the facilities work in a safe, timely and competent manner, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, up to the full amount of the bond. 
(3)  Upon completion of the facilities work to the satisfaction of the city engineer, the city engineer shall eliminate the bond or reduce its amount after a time appropriate to determine whether the work performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established by the city engineer considering the nature of the work performed. 
(4)  A performance bond shall be issued by a surety acceptable to the city and shall contain the following endorsement: "This bond may not be canceled or allowed to lapse until 60 days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
(5)  The applicant shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, its officials, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action or proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable relief that are caused by laws, errors and omissions of the applicant arising out of the construction and maintenance of its facilities. 
(6)  Recovery by the city of any amounts under the performance bond or otherwise does not limit an applicant's duty to indemnify the city in any way, nor shall such recovery relieve an applicant of its obligations under a permit or reduce the amounts owed to the city other than by the amounts recovered by the city under the performance bond, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. 
(b)  Penalties. For each violation of the provisions of this chapter or a permit granted pursuant to this chapter as to which the city has given notice to the applicant as provided in this chapter, penalties may be chargeable to the applicant at a rate not exceeding $100.00 per day for so long as the violation continues.

(a)  Compliance with laws. Each applicant shall comply with all applicable city ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations heretofore and hereafter adopted or established.

(c)  Rights and remedies. 
(1)  The exercise of one remedy under this chapter shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of damages or penalties relieve an applicant of its obligations to comply with its permits.

(2)  The city hereby reserves to itself the right to intervene in any suit, action or proceeding involving any provisions of this chapter.

(d)  Incorporation by reference. Any permit granted pursuant to this chapter shall by implication include a provision that shall incorporate by reference this chapter into such permit as fully as if copied therein verbatim. 
(e)  Force majeure. An applicant shall not be deemed in violation of provisions of this chapter where performance was rendered impossible by war or riots, civil disturbances, floods, or other natural catastrophes beyond the applicant's control, and a permit shall not be revoked or an applicant penalized for such non-compliance, provided that the applicant takes immediate and diligent steps to bring itself back into compliance with its permit as soon as possible under the circumstances without unduly endangering the health, safety and integrity of the applicant's employees or property, the public, public right-of-way, public property or private property. 
(f)  Calculation of time.

(h)  Wireless facilities and wireless support structures. Pursuant to the city's authority, including by RSMo 67.1830 , and due to the limited space in the city's rights-of-way and in order to minimize obstructions and interference with the use of the rights-of-way and to ensure traffic safety, preserve property values, and enforce the public policy to maintain neutrality as to ownership of wireless locations, wireless facilities, support structures and equipment shall not be permitted in the rights-of-way on new structures unless the board of aldermen determines on a nondiscriminatory basis such proposed application is in the public interest addressing all concerns stated in this chapter, and provided such use and location has received prior, separate zoning authorization to the extent permitted by law. In such circumstances where any new wireless application is permitted in the rights-of-way, such uses shall be subject to reasonable regulations, including any applicable specifications, compensation, and other terms established by the city in such approval or agreements. Wireless antennas and related facilities on existing structures or underground may be permitted in the same manner as other uses in the rights-of-way but subject to approval, denial or condition relating to location, design, height, appearance, safety, and such other zoning, building specification or other regulations, except as may be limited by law.

Sec. 630.020. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  Adult entertainment establishments are hereby acknowledged to have special characteristics and impacts upon their surroundings and upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent property.

These regulations are further intended to require that adult entertainment establishments shall not be permitted to locate in such concentration that their operational features may establish the dominant character of any commercial or industrial area. 
(b)  These regulations are further intended to protect and balance lawful rights of expression with other lawful rights to the enjoyment and use of property. Adult entertainment uses are recognized as those having serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, which could contribute to blight and degradation of the surrounding neighborhood. The special regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary to ensure that the adverse effect of such uses will not contribute to the blighting and downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods, whether residential or non-residential by location or concentration, and to ensure the stability of such neighborhoods.

(b)  A communications services agreement shall also not permit the licensee to operate an open video system, except where otherwise expressly provided in the agreement or by separate agreement and the licensee remits the maximum fees permitted by 47 USC 573(c)(2)(B) and where licensee otherwise complies with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 USC 573. Absent such applicable agreement from the city, licensee shall be prohibited from offering OVS service and any such service shall be considered a breach of the agreement. 
(c)  Unless otherwise specified, any such new agreement or amendment to an agreement shall obligate licensee to pay a use fee of five percent on all gross revenues directly or indirectly attributable to the provision of OVS service within the city. 
(d)  The city may, at its option, negotiate with licensee to exchange all or a part of the use fees for capacity or facilities used for city or other public purposes.

Thereafter, each licensee shall provide the city on at least a semi-annual basis the identity of entities with which the ROW user has entered into an interconnection or resale agreement within the state or those providing service within the city, if that information is available. This notice will not relieve the reseller service provider from its own obligation to register and obtain any necessary agreement with the city. 
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a facility-based service provider from providing to any reseller service provider the use of the facility-based service provider's facilities in the right-of-way as authorized by federal or state law.

Sec. 655.140. - Sale or lease of facilities. 
    Except as otherwise may be provided by law or agreement, the licensee shall not lease, sell or otherwise transfer possession or control of the facilities or any portion thereof for any purpose to any person that has not obtained a duly issued agreement or other grant by the city to use the rights-of-way and which includes the authority to use or maintain such leased or transferred facilities. The licensee shall provide the city at least 30 days' prior notice of such intended sale, lease or transfer of possession or control. 
(Code 2006, § 675.150; Code 2008, § 655.150; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(2.6), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.150. - Use fee. 
    To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, a fee for use of the rights-of-way for purposes other than cable television facilities shall be imposed on a linear foot basis as may be established from time to time by the board of aldermen or such other basis as may be established by the board of aldermen in light of the type of use, circumstances and applicable regulatory requirements, if any. 
(Code 2006, § 675.160; Code 2008, § 655.160; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(2.7), 2-18-2004) 
ARTICLE III. - CABLE SERVICES 

Sec. 655.160. - Cable franchise requirements. 
(a)  General findings regarding cable services. The city finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens' lives and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to residents of the city. At the same time, the rapidly emerging role of cable systems as an integrated broadband communications platform necessitates a finding that the local government has a legitimate and vital role to play in regulating cable services in a manner that ensures high quality customer service while at the same time fostering competition to the extent permitted under law. The board of aldermen further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the city. 
(b)  Unlawful to operate without a franchise. It is unlawful for any person to construct, operate or maintain a cable system or to provide cable service or other competing, multichannel video services in the city without a franchise, unless otherwise specifically authorized under applicable federal or state law. Consistent with article V of this chapter, any such person shall be subject to a fine of $500.00 per day. The payment of such fine notwithstanding, all such violators shall be subject to all other applicable provisions of this chapter to the fullest extent allowed by law, including, but not limited to, the payment of a franchise fee. This section shall not apply to a grantee who has properly asserted its intent and is diligently pursuing renewal of the franchise pursuant to 47 USC 546. 
(c)  Franchise not exclusive. 
(1)  Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be non-exclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system or any component thereof to any other person including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to this chapter and applicable federal and state law. 
(2)  The terms and conditions of any cable franchises granted or renewed pursuant to this chapter shall be, when taken as a whole, no less burdensome or more beneficial than any other cable franchises granted or renewed pursuant to this chapter, when taking into consideration the context in which the earlier terms were adopted; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the use of identical terms or conditions or limit the enforceability of conditions that are freely negotiated. 
(3)  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to create any cause of action or claim of breach by any franchisee or third party. 
(d)  Franchise territory. Every cable franchise shall apply to the entire territorial area of the city, as it exists now or may later be configured. 
(e)  Federal, state and city jurisdiction. 
(1)  This chapter and Code shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(2)  In the event that the federal or state government discontinues pre-emption in any area of cable communications over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal regulatory authority, the city may, if it so elects, adopt rules and regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law and the reasonable exercise of the city's police powers. 
(3)  Unless otherwise expressly provided in a franchise, all provisions of this chapter and Code shall apply to all cable franchises granted or renewed after or simultaneously with the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. This chapter and Code shall also apply to all existing franchises to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of any such franchise or applicable law and to the extent that it does not impose additional material burdens on such grantee. A cable franchise (including all of grantee's particular rights, powers, protections, privileges, immunities and obligations associated therewith as the same exist on the date hereof) shall constitute a legally binding contract between the city and the grantee and as such cannot be amended, modified or changed by the city without the consent of the grantee in any manner whatsoever, whether by ordinance, rule, regulation or otherwise, to impose on the grantee more stringent or burdensome requirements or conditions. In the event of any express conflict between the terms and conditions of a franchise and the provisions of this chapter or Code and other generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the city, the specific terms of the franchise shall control; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall preclude the city from the proper exercise of its police powers. 
(4)  In the event of a change in state or federal law which by its terms would require the city to amend this chapter or Code, the parties shall modify the existing franchise in a mutually agreed upon manner. 
(5)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to restrict the board of aldermen from authorizing a franchise having express requirements that differ from those established by this chapter, provided that such different requirements do not violate applicable law. 
(f)  Initial franchise applications. Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable system shall file an application with the city. A non-refundable application fee as may be hereinafter established by the city shall accompany the application, that shall not be considered or credited against the collection of applicable franchise fees. 
(g)  Consideration of initial applications. 
(1)  Upon receipt of any application for an initial franchise, the city administrator or other designated administrative official shall prepare a report and make his recommendations respecting such application to the board of aldermen. 
(2)  A public hearing shall be held prior to any initial franchise grant at a time and date approved by the board of aldermen. Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the board of aldermen shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether or not the franchises should be granted and, if granted, subject to what conditions. 
(h)  Franchise renewal. Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law, including, but not necessarily limited to, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. The city and a grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. 
(i)  Grant of additional franchise and competing service. Since competing or overlapping cable franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way, on the quality and availability of services to the public and may adversely affect an existing provider's ability to continue to provide the services it is presently providing under a franchise, the city may issue a franchise in an area where another grantee is operating only following a public hearing to consider the potential impact which the grant of an additional franchise may have on the community. In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the city shall specifically consider and address in a written report the following issues: 
(1)  The positive or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
(2)  The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable services to the entire franchise area that is served by the existing cable provider. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on terms which, when taken as a whole, do not give a competitive advantage to one grantee over another. 
(3)  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed cable system and activate cable service in the entire franchise area; and whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its cable system in a timely manner. 
(4)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain and operate the proposed cable system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the city may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current financial statements, bonds, letters of credit or other documentation to demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed cable system are available. 
(5)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed cable system based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such cable system. 
(6)  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance and operation of a cable system. 
(7)  The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
(8)  The disruption of existing cable service and the potential that the proposed franchise would adversely affect the residents of the city. 
(9)  The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable service to subscribers within the entire franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
(10)  Such other information as the city may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise. 
(j)  Permits for non-franchised entities. The city may issue a license to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of a grantee's franchise area within the city in order to provide cable service outside but not within the city. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit the person to provide cable service of any type to any home or place of business within the city. Such license shall be granted pursuant to the requirements of article II of this chapter. 
(Code 2006, § 675.170; Code 2008, § 655.170; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.1), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.170. - Design, services, capabilities and location. 
(a)  Cable system design. Every grantee shall offer cable service that meets the current and future cable-related needs of the city. Such cable service shall, at a minimum, be comparable to cable services offered by that grantee or its affiliates operating any headend serving the city and surrounding municipalities in St. Charles County and St. Louis County. The franchise shall incorporate a description of the grantee's cable system including the general design and capabilities of the cable system to identify for the city how the cable system will meet the current and future cable needs of the city. 
(b)  The cable system. Every cable system shall pass by every single-family dwelling unit and multiple-family dwelling unit within the franchise area in accordance with line extension policies set forth in this chapter. Service shall be provided to subscribers in accordance with the schedules and line extension policies specified in this chapter unless otherwise specified in the franchise. 
(c)  Drops to public buildings. 
(1)  Every grantee shall provide installation of at least one cable drop and one outlet, and provide monthly basic cable service, without charge, to public buildings specified by the city in the applicable franchise, where the drop does not exceed 200 feet. All accredited K-12 schools shall also receive one cable drop and one outlet and basic cable service at no charge, subject to the above 200-foot limit. The location of such cable drops and outlets shall be determined in cooperation with the management of the public building to which the connection is to be made. Following the city's designation of additional public buildings to receive cable service, a grantee shall complete construction of the drop and outlet within 90 days if the city requests construction, weather permitting, and subject to payment of the direct incremental costs of installation in excess of 200 feet. Drops and outlets that are in addition to the one free drop and outlet required by this section shall be provided by a grantee at the cost of grantee's time and material. Alternatively, at an institution's request, the institution may add outlets at its own expense, as long as such installation meets the grantee's standards that shall be made readily available to any public entity upon request. Additional outlets and services to public buildings are subject to the applicable commercial rate. 
(2)  All such cable service outlets shall not be utilized for commercial purposes. The city shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of a grantee's cable system in any inappropriate manner or that may result in loss or damage to the cable system. Users of such outlets shall hold the grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such outlets, other than for those claims arising out of improper installation or faulty equipment. 
(3)  In instances where the drop line from the feeder cable to the public building, school or library exceeds 200 feet, the grantee may charge for its direct incremental costs that are incurred in exceeding this length. 
(d)  School and library cable modems. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable franchise, upon activation and commercial offering of two-way cable modem service within the franchise area, every grantee shall provide upon written request at least one courtesy cable modem and cable Internet service without charge to every state accredited K-12 school and library in the franchise area. 
(e)  Use of grantee's facilities. Subject to any applicable state or federal law, the city shall have the right to install and maintain, free of charge, upon the poles and within the underground pipes and conduits of a grantee, any wires and fixtures desired by the city for public purposes; provided, however, that: 
(1)  Such use by the city does not unreasonably interfere with the current or future use by the grantee; 
(2)  Such use by the city is restricted to non-commercial public purposes; and 
(3)  The city takes reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the grantee's facilities in any manner that results in an inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the cable system. 
For the purposes of this subsection, the term "public purposes" includes, but is not limited to, the use of the structures and installations for city, fire, police, traffic, utility or signal systems, but not for cable system purposes in competition with the grantee. The grantee shall not deduct the value of such use of its facilities from its franchise fee or other fees payable to the city. 
(f)  Upgrade of system. Every grantee shall upgrade its cable system (herein referred to as the "system upgrade"), if required, as set forth in its respective franchise. 
(g)  Emergency alert capability. Every grantee shall at all times provide the system capabilities to comply with the FCC's emergency alert system rules and regulations. Provided that at a minimum these capabilities will remain in place even if the FCC at some future date eliminates the current regulations. 
(h)  Periodic review. The franchise shall include provisions to provide for a periodic review between the city and a grantee to evaluate changes in law, technology or service and reasonable procedures for mutually agreed upon modifications to the franchise to incorporate changes identified as desirable or necessary as a result of any such periodic review. 
(i)  Closed captioning and descriptive audio service. Every grantee will make audio descriptive service and closed captioning capabilities available to the extent required by state and federal law. 
(j)  Standby power. Within 12 months of activation of the system, the grantee shall provide standby power generating capacity capable of providing at least two hours of emergency supply at the hub site feeding the system. For nodes, two hours with emergency power supply. Every grantee shall maintain standby power system supplies throughout the major trunk cable networks capable of providing emergency power within the standard limits of commercially available power supply units. 
(k)  Status monitoring. Every grantee shall provide an automatic status monitoring system or a functional equivalent, which monitors modes and power supplies in the outside plant and critical network elements at the hub, when the cable system has been activated for interactive service, provided that such status monitoring is technically and economically feasible. 
(l)  HDTV/ATV conversion. Conversion to high definition television/advanced television (HDTV/ATV) formats shall occur in accordance with applicable law. 
(m)  Joint trenching. In addition to other coordination requirements, cable drops and extensions shall be constructed either simultaneous ditching (joint trenching) with other utilities or included within conduit facilities constructed as part of the street or related infrastructure installation in new subdivisions or new construction. The city engineer shall review requests for exceptions to this requirement and may grant waivers only on showing of good cause. 
(n)  Location of aboveground facilities. Cable vaults, pedestals, boxes and covers, unless underground, shall be installed within the rear building lines unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Where joint trenching has been waived in writing by the city engineer, the property owner's ground that has been disturbed in the established subdivision will be promptly restored and sodded by franchisee. 
(Code 2006, § 675.180; Code 2008, § 655.180; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.2), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.180. - Institutional network and public, educational and governmental access (or PEG access). 
(a)  Institutional network, access channels. 
(1)  Every grantee shall, to the extent required in its franchise and subject to applicable law, provide or fund on an equal basis with other cable providers whose franchises are granted or renewed after the adoption of this chapter an institutional network that provides two-way broadband voice, video and data capabilities for use by governmental, educational and other publicly funded or non-profit local community service organizations identified by the city. Such institutional network requirements shall at a minimum satisfy the community need for such facilities as determined by the board of aldermen for the period of the applicable franchise. 
(2)  Every grantee shall also provide a channel, bandwidth capacity, service and funding for separate public, educational and government access channels as specified in their franchise. All such PEG access channels shall be available to all subscribers as part of their basic cable service. Given the ongoing changes in the state of technology as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, absent the express written consent of the city, grantee shall transmit PEG access channels in the format or technology utilized to transmit all of the channels on the basic cable service tier. Oversight and administration of the PEG access channels shall be set forth in the franchise. 
(b)  Proof of performance testing. To ensure high quality service on the institutional network and access channels, proof of performance testing throughout the system and on all channels will be made available to the city to the extent required in a franchise. Every grantee will monitor access channels throughout the cable system to determine the level of technical quality of access channels is in conformance with FCC rules and to ensure that the level of technical quality on such access channels is the same as on other channels within the cable system. In the event that a complaint is made by a programmer of any access channels, the grantee shall immediately investigate the complaint and determine whether the grantee is in compliance with the technical standards set forth in section 655.190(a)(2). 
(Code 2006, § 675.190; Code 2008, § 655.190; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.3), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.190. - Technical standards and customer service practices. 
(a)  General technical standards and customer service practices. 
(1)  This chapter incorporates cable service technical standards and establishes customer service practices that every grantee must satisfy. 
(2)  Every grantee shall maintain such equipment and keep such records as required to comply with all customer service and technical standards required by these regulations and other applicable laws. The grantee shall at all times assist and cooperate with city in explaining, interpreting and understanding such records or reports. 
(b)  Test and compliance procedure. Tests for a cable system shall be performed periodically in a manner so as to conform with FCC specifications. The tests may be witnessed by representatives of the city and written test reports shall be made available to the city upon request. If any test locations fail to meet the performance standards, the grantee shall be required to indicate what corrective measures have been taken and shall have the site retested. 
(c)  Cable system office hours and telephone availability. 
(1)  Every grantee shall maintain a conveniently located customer service center that shall include a place where subscribers may pay their bills, pick up and return converter boxes and comparable items and receive information on the grantee and its services. Such service center shall be open at least during normal business hours. The grantee shall also maintain a publicly listed toll-free or local telephone line that is available to subscribers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(2)  Every grantee shall have trained company representatives available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal business hours. 
(3)  After normal business hours, the telephone access line may be answered by a service or an automated response system, including an answering machine. Inquiries received after normal business hours must be responded to by a trained representative on the next business day. 
(4)  Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a trained customer service representative or automated response unit, including wait time, shall not exceed 30 seconds when the connection is made. If a call must be transferred, transfer time shall not exceed 30 seconds. Under normal operating conditions, these standards shall be met no less than 90 percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis. 
(5)  Under normal operating conditions, a grantee shall establish an inbound telephone system upon which subscribers shall not receive a busy signal more than three percent of the time. 
(6)  A grantee will not be required to acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone answering standards above unless an historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply. 
(d)  Cable channels for commercial use, local commercial television signals and non-commercial educational television. A franchisee shall designate channel capacity for commercial and non-commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the franchisee as required by federal law consistent with the principle of fairness and equal accessibility to all persons and the city to the extent they have a legitimate use for such capacity. 
(e)  Technical standards. 
(1)  Any cable system within the city shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 CFR 76.601 et seq. and any other applicable federal technical standards, including any such reasonable standards as hereafter may be amended or adopted by the board of aldermen in a manner consistent with federal law. 
(2)  A franchisee shall use equipment generally used in high-quality, reliable, modern systems of similar design, including, but not limited to, back-up power supplies at the outside plant capable of providing power to the system for a minimum of two hours in the event of an electrical outage and permanent standby generators for the headend/primary hubs plus adequate portable generators to cover longer outages. The obligation to provide back-up power supplies requires the franchisee to install equipment that will: 
a.  Cut in automatically on failure of commercial utility AC power; 
b.  Revert automatically to commercial power when it is restored; and 
c.  Prevent the standby power source from powering a "dead" utility line. In addition, the design and construction of a system shall include modulators, antennae, amplifiers and other electronics that permit and are capable of passing through the signal received at the headend with minimal alteration or deterioration. 
(f)  Interconnection. 
(1)  A franchisee shall design its system so that it may be interconnected with any or all other systems or similar communications systems in the area. Interconnection of systems may be made by direct cable connection, microwave link, satellite or other appropriate methods. 
(2)  Upon receiving the directive of the board of aldermen to interconnect, the franchisee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system so that costs may be shared proportionately for both construction and operation of the interconnection link. 
(3)  The board of aldermen may in writing grant reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or rescind its request to interconnect upon its own initiative or upon petition by the franchisee to the board of aldermen. The board of aldermen shall rescind the request if it finds that the franchisee has negotiated in good faith and the cost of interconnection would cause unreasonable increase in subscriber rates. 
(4)  No interconnection shall take place without prior written approval of the board of aldermen. A franchisee seeking approval for interconnection shall demonstrate that all signals to be interconnected will comply with FCC technical standards for all classes of signals and will result in no more than a low level of distortion. 
(5)  The franchisee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority or state or federal regulatory agency which may be established for regulating, facilitating, financing or otherwise providing for the interconnection of communications systems beyond the boundaries of the city. 
(g)  Integration of advancements in technology. A franchise agreement may require a franchisee to periodically upgrade its cable system to integrate advancements in technology as may be necessary to meet the needs and interests of the community in light of the costs thereof or to submit periodic reports on cable technology and competition to the city clerk. 
(h)  System design review process. In addition to any requirements included in a franchise agreement, at least 60 days prior to the date construction of any rebuild or major extension is scheduled to commence, the franchisee shall provide the city clerk with notice that a detailed system design and construction plan is available for review by the city at a specific office of the franchisee located in the metropolitan St. Louis area, that shall include at least the following elements: 
(1)  Design type, trunk and feeder design and number and location of hubs or nodes. 
(2)  Distribution system-cable, fiber and equipment to be used. 
(3)  Plans for standby power. 
(4)  Longest amplifier cascade in system (number of amplifiers, number of miles, type of cable/fiber). 
(5)  Design maps and tree trunk maps for the system. The system design will be shown on maps of industry standard scale using standard symbols and shall depict all electronic and physical features of the cable plant. The city may review the plan and, within 30 days of the date the plan is made available for city review, submit comments to the franchisee. Within 15 days of receipt of the comments, the franchisee shall notify the city clerk that a revised plan is available for review by the city at a specific office located in the metropolitan St. Louis area, either incorporating the comments or explaining why the comments were not included. The city's review does not excuse any non-performance under a franchise agreement, this chapter or other applicable law. 
(i)  Emergency alert system. A franchise shall comply with 47 USC 544(g) and all regulations issued pursuant thereto. 
(j)  Service calls and installations. Under normal operating conditions, each of the following standards must be met no less than 95 percent of the time as measured on a quarterly basis: 
(1)  Standard installations will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed. Standard installations are those that are located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution system. 
(2)  The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be either a specific time or within a maximum four-hour time block during normal business hours. The grantee may schedule service calls and other installation activities outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of a subscriber, if so requested. 
(3)  A grantee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. 
(4)  If a grantee's representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the subscriber must be contacted. The appointment must be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time that is convenient for the subscriber. 
(k)  Repairs and interruptions. 
(1)  Under normal operating conditions and excluding conditions beyond the control of a grantee, every grantee will begin working on service interruptions and outages within a reasonable time frame, but in no event later than 24 hours after the service interruption or outage becomes known. The grantee must begin actions to correct other service problems on the business day following notification of such service problems. 
(2)  The term "service interruption" means the loss of picture or sound on one or more cable channels or cable Internet service connectivity, if permitted under applicable law. 
(3)  Work on requests for service, excluding conditions beyond the control of a grantee, must begin by the next business day after notification of the problem and shall exercise all due diligence to complete the work in the shortest period of time possible. 
(4)  Outside repairs to cable plant which cannot be made by the initial service technician dispatched shall under normal operating conditions be rescheduled within 24 hours of the originally scheduled service call. The subscriber does not need to be home for outside plant and line repairs. 
(5)  A grantee may interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time reasonably possible, including interruption for system upgrade, maintenance and repair. Subject to the reasonable safety precautions for the benefit of the grantee's employees and agents, routine maintenance shall occur at times that affect the fewest number of subscribers, generally between 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. To the extent that specific neighborhoods will be affected by a planned outage such as during an upgrade, the grantee shall provide advance notice through telephone calls, door hangers or other reasonable means. 
(6)  A grantee shall provide a credit equivalent to a pro rata of the monthly cable rate for each service interruption exceeding four hours in any 24-hour period, unless it is demonstrated that the subscriber caused the outage or the outage was planned as part of an upgrade or other work that occurred between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. of which the city and the subscriber received appropriate prior notification. A subscriber is entitled to a full refund for any cable system or disruption to a pay-per-view event. These credits and refunds shall be made available upon request by subscriber describing the time, date and nature of the disruption experienced. 
(7)  Technicians capable of performing service-related emergency repairs and maintenance must be available 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays. 
(8)  No charge shall be made to a subscriber for any service call relating to grantee-owned and grantee-maintained equipment after the initial installation of cable service unless the problem giving rise to the service request can be demonstrated by grantee to have been: 
a.  Caused by the negligence or malicious destruction of cable equipment by the subscriber; or 
b.  A problem established as having been non-cable system or cable service in origin. 
A grantee may also assess a service charge for repeat service calls to the same address in instances where the problem was not caused by the grantee. 
(9)  Cable drop lines, cable trunk lines or any other type of outside wiring that comprise part of a grantee's cable system that are located underground shall be placed in such locations pursuant to city code and the surrounding ground shall be restored as close as is practical to its condition immediately prior to such underground construction activity within a reasonable period of time after connection to the cable system. Except for a grantee's maintenance facilities, no cable drop line, cable trunk line or any other type of outside wiring shall be permitted to lay upon the ground for an unreasonable period of time within the city, except for the express purpose of being immediately connected to the cable system of grantee. The requirements of this subsection shall apply to all installation, reinstallation, service or repair commenced by a grantee within the city during normal operating conditions. 
(l)  Disconnections and downgrades. 
(1)  If any subscriber fails to pay a properly due monthly subscriber fee or any other properly due fee or charge, the grantee may disconnect the subscriber's outlet; provided, however, that such disconnection shall not be effected until after the later of: 
a.  Thirty days after the due date of the delinquent fee or charge; or 
b.  Fifteen days after delivery to subscriber of written notice of the intent to disconnect. 
If a subscriber pays before expiration of the later of subsection (l)(1)a or (1)b of this section, the grantee shall not disconnect. Provided however, that this section does not apply to subscribers disconnected as a result of insufficient funds. 
(2)  No subscriber may be disconnected without prior written notice. 
(3)  No subscriber may be disconnected for non-payment if payment of outstanding balances is made before the scheduled date for disconnection, up to and including the last business day before the scheduled disconnection. 
(4)  No subscriber may be disconnected due to a grantee's failure to timely or correctly post payments. 
(5)  No subscriber may be disconnected outside of normal business hours or on Sundays or holidays. 
(6)  Absent extenuating circumstances, a grantee is not required to reconnect a subscriber with an undisputed outstanding balance. 
(7)  A grantee is permitted to refuse orders for premium or pay-per-view services from subscribers with a record of non-payment. 
(8)  A grantee may disconnect subscriber premises that are responsible for signal leakage in excess of applicable federal limits. A grantee may effectuate such disconnection without advance notice, provided that a grantee shall immediately notify the subscriber with door tags or telephone calls or other reasonable means. If the source of the signal leakage is remedied and the subscriber was not the cause of such leakage, the grantee shall reconnect the subscriber at no charge. If the subscriber was the cause of the signal leakage, the grantee may charge a reasonable reconnection fee. For purposes of this section, use of FCC-approved navigation devices does not in and of itself constitute subscriber caused signal leakage. 
(9)  Subscribers may request disconnection or a downgrade of cable service at any time. A grantee may not impose any charge for service delivered after the requested date of disconnection. As provided under federal law, subscribers may request a downgrade at no charge if made within 30 days of a rate increase. 
(10)  Nothing in this chapter or Code shall limit the right of a grantee to deny cable service to any household or individual which has a negative credit or cable service history with the grantee, which may include non-payment of bills, theft or damage to the grantee's equipment, outstanding balances or threats or assaults on employees of the grantee in the course of their employment. In the event cable service is denied, the grantee will give notice to the subscriber of the right to contact the appropriate authority as designated by the city. 
(m)  Communications between grantee and subscribers. 
(1)  Notifications to subscribers. 
a.  Every grantee shall provide written information to subscribers on each of the following topics at the time of installation, at least annually to all subscribers and at any time upon request of a subscriber: 
1.  Product and services offered; 
2.  Prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other services and facilities; 
3.  Installation and service maintenance policies; 
4.  Instructions on how to use services; 
5.  Channel positions of programming offered on a system; and 
6.  Billing and complaint procedures, including the name, address and telephone number of the city. 
b.  Subscribers will be given 30 days' advance notice of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions, if the change is within the control of the grantee. All such notice shall be provided in writing by any reasonable means. In addition, the grantee shall notify subscribers 30 days in advance of any significant changes in other information required by this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of this franchise to the contrary, a grantee shall not be required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee or any other fee, tax assessment or change of any kind imposed by any government entity on the transaction between the grantee and the subscriber. 
(2)  Billing. 
a.  Bills must be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized, including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. 
b.  Bills must clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
c.  In case of a billing dispute, a grantee must respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within 30 calendar days. 
d.  Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle after determination that the credit is warranted. 
(3)  Late charges. A grantee may impose a monthly fee for any delinquent balance owed by a subscriber, subject to the following: 
a.  At least ten days before the date the fee is imposed, the subscriber shall be given written notice on the face of the bill or by separate notice of: 
1.  The date after which the fee will be imposed if the balance is not paid; and 
2.  The amount of the fee that will be imposed. 
b.  The fee for the delinquent payment shall not exceed $2.95 in the event that the subscriber fails to pay its fee within 30 days after the date in which the fee is due to the grantee. Grantee may impose an additional $1.70 late charge in the event that subscriber fails to pay its fee within 45 days after the date in which the fee is due to the grantee. 
c.  Grantee reserves the right to revise the late charge so that the fee is the same throughout the metropolitan area, provided that the grantee gives 30 days' written notice to the city and is not greater than five percent of the amount of the delinquent balance or $5.00 per month, whichever is greater. 
(4)  Refunds. Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than either: 
a.  The subscriber's next billing cycle following resolution of the request or 30 days, whichever is earlier; or 
b.  The return of equipment supplied by the grantee if cable services are terminated. 
(n)  Complaint log. Subject to the privacy provisions of 47 USC 521 et seq., every grantee shall prepare and maintain written records of all complaints made to them and the resolution of such complaints, including the date of such resolution. Such written records shall be on file at the office of grantee. A grantee shall make available to city a written summary of such complaints and their resolution upon request. 
(o)  Parental control. Every grantee shall make available to any subscriber upon request a lockout device for blocking both video and audio portions of any channels of programming entering the subscriber's premises. Such device shall be provided at a reasonable charge, except to the extent that federal law specifically provides otherwise. A grantee may, however, require a reasonable security deposit for the use of such a device. 
(p)  Service area. 
(1)  Area served. A franchisee shall build and maintain its system so that within a reasonable period of time, as established by the franchise, it is able to provide service to all households desiring service located within the franchise area without any construction charges (other than standard connection charges). A franchisee must build and maintain its system so that it can extend service to households desiring service located outside the franchise area in accordance with subsection (p)(2)a through (2)f of this section. Connections to commercial customers shall be governed by subsection (p)(2)g of this section. 
(2)  Line extension requirements. 
a.  For areas within the city limits but outside the franchise area, including areas annexed after the effective date of its franchise, a franchisee shall extend its trunk and distribution system to serve households desiring service without any construction charge (other than standard connection charges and drop charges as authorized herein), unless the franchisee demonstrates to the board of aldermen's satisfaction evidenced by written decision that circumstances justify a specific charge, where the new subscriber requesting service is located within 150 feet from the termination of the cable system or the number of potential subscribers to be passed by such extension is equal to or greater than 24 potential households per cable mile or portion thereof, measured from any point on the system. 
b.  In circumstances where that the factors requiring line extension do not exist as set forth in the foregoing paragraph are not met, the franchisee shall on the request of the board of aldermen extend its cable system based upon the following cost-sharing formula. The franchisee shall contribute an amount equal to the construction costs per mile multiplied by the length of the extension in miles, multiplied by a fraction where the numerator equals the number of potential households per mile at the time of the request and the denominator equals 24. Households requesting service as of the completion of construction can be required to bear the remainder of the total construction costs on a pro rata basis. 
c.  The term "construction costs" means actual turnkey costs to construct the entire extension including lines, materials, electronics, pole make-ready charges and labor but not the cost of drops except as provided below. If the franchisee proposes to require a household requesting extension to make a contribution in aid of extension, it must: 
1.  Notify the board of aldermen in advance; 
2.  Send the board of aldermen a copy of the invoice showing the amount actually charged each household requesting extension; and 
3.  Within 30 days of completion of the extension, furnish proof of the total cost of the extension and make any appropriate refunds if the total cost is less than the amounts charged in advance of construction. 
At the end of each calendar year, the franchisee must calculate the amount any contributing person would have paid based on the number of persons served at that time and pay back the difference between the amount which would then be owed. The franchisee shall report such calculations and refunds to the city clerk by the end of January of the following year. 
d.  Installation of drops. Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise require, the franchisee shall not assess any additional cost for service drops of 150 feet or less unless the franchise demonstrates to the board of aldermen's satisfaction, evidenced by written decision, that circumstances justify a specific charge. Where a drop exceeds 150 feet in length, a franchisee may charge the subscriber for the difference between the franchisee's actual costs associated with installing a 150-foot drop and the franchisee's actual cost of installing the longer drop, provided that drop length shall be the shorter of: 
1.  Actual length of installed drop; or 
2.  The shortest practicable distance to the point where the franchisee would be required to extend its distribution system. 
e.  Location of drop. Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise require or otherwise approved by the city, all cables and wires shall be installed underground parallel to other utilities where such easements or space is available for use by franchisee. 
f.  Time for extension. A franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it: 
1.  Within seven days of the request within the franchise area or where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop within 150 feet of the existing distribution system; 
2.  Within 30 days of the request for service outside the franchise area where an extension of one-half mile or less (but more than 150 feet) is required; or 
3.  Within six months for service outside the franchise area where an extension of one-half mile or more is required. 
g.  Because existing conditions can vary dramatically, franchisee may in its discretion require commercial customers to pay all reasonable costs of connection (including time and materials) in excess of the average cost of connection for residential services. 
(3)  Newly annexed areas. In such cases where mandatory extension of the cable system is required for areas newly annexed after the effective date of the franchise, but the technical capabilities of then-existing cable system are such that the minimum technical performance standards required by this franchise or the FCC cannot be met, then the grantee shall be required to make such extension only if the grantee can earn a fair return (as measured by the grantee's weighted average cost of capital) on the incremental investment required combined with the overall investment base of the cable system within the boundaries of the franchise area. 
(4)  Special agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners or residents. 
(q)  Customer service reporting requirements. The city may require upon reasonable request that a grantee periodically prepare and furnish to city annual reports and any other reasonable information relevant to the grantee's compliance with the customer service requirements of this chapter measured on a quarterly basis. 
(Code 2006, § 675.200; Code 2008, § 655.200; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.4), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.200. - Operation and maintenance. 
(a)  Open books and records. Every grantee shall cooperate with the city with respect to the city's administration of this chapter and Code and any applicable franchise granted pursuant to it. Subject to the privacy provisions of the Cable Act, the city shall have the right to inspect, upon three business days' notice during normal business hours, all books, records, maps, plans, financial statements, service complaint logs, performance test results and other existing like materials of a grantee that relate to the operation of the grantee's cable system and that are reasonably necessary to city's enforcement or administration of this chapter or the grantee's franchise. A grantee shall not be required to maintain any books or records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three years, except that financial records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the required cable franchise fee payments shall be kept for six years. Upon request, the city will treat designated information disclosed by a grantee as confidential to the extent permissible under state and federal law. All such review of a grantee's books and records shall be performed by an independent party if the city itself enters into the business as a competitor. 
(b)  Communications with regulatory agencies. Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted by a grantee to the FCC, Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction with respect to any matters directly affecting the cable system operations shall be made available contemporaneously to the city upon request. Copies of responses from the above regulatory agencies to a grantee likewise shall be made available promptly to the city upon request. If the city is specifically named in any such pleading or response, the city shall automatically be furnished a copy. 
(c)  Annual reports. 
(1)  Upon request, a grantee shall make available to city, within 90 days of the end of each of the applicable grantee's fiscal years during the term of this franchise, the following: 
a.  A revenue statement certified by a representative of the grantee showing the gross revenues of the grantee for the preceding fiscal year; 
b.  A current list of names and addresses of each officer and director and other management personnel of the grantee; 
c.  A copy of all documents that relate directly to the grantee's cable system that were filed with any federal, state or local agencies during the preceding fiscal year and that were not previously filed with city; 
d.  A statement of the grantee's current billing practices and charges; 
e.  A copy, if any, of the grantee's current subscriber service contract; and 
f.  A copy of annual reports to stockholders, if any, for operating company and parent company. 
All of the above information shall not be required annually unless there is a change after the first filing. 
(2)  The city and its agents and representatives shall have authority to arrange for and conduct an audit during normal business hours of the books and records of grantee that are reasonably necessary for the enforcement of a franchise. A grantee shall first be given 30 days' notice of the audit, the description of and purpose for the audit and a description, to the best of city's ability, of the books, records and documents that city wants to review. The costs and expense of such audit shall be borne by the grantee if the audit reveals a discrepancy of two percent or more from the information related to the city. 
(3)  Any review or audit of a grantee's books and records shall be performed by an independent party if the city itself enters into the business as a competitor to provide cable services. 
(d)  Additional reports and assistance. Upon request of the city, a grantee shall add additional reports to the index that are reasonably necessary to the city's proper enforcement of this chapter, Code or franchise. The city shall require such reports only through passage of a formal resolution of the city. In addition, upon request, a grantee shall cooperate and assist the city in interpreting and understanding any report required under this chapter, Code or its franchise, including through the provision of explanatory graphs or charts. 
(e)  Service contract and subscriber information. 
(1)  A grantee shall have authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this chapter and its franchise and to ensure uninterrupted cable service to all of its subscribers, provided such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, federal, state or local law or any applicable rules and regulations. 
(2)  Upon request, a grantee shall submit to city any subscriber contract form that it utilizes. If no written contract exists, a grantee shall file with the city a document completely and concisely stating the terms of the residential subscriber contract offered, specifically including the length of the subscriber contract. The length and terms of any subscriber contract shall be available for public inspection during normal business hours. 
(Code 2006, § 675.210; Code 2008, § 655.210; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.5), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.210. - Financial provisions, remedies, procedures and due process. 
(a)  Cable franchise fee. 
(1)  As compensation for grant of a franchise and in consideration of permission to use the rights-of-way of the city for the construction, operation, maintenance and reconstruction of a cable system and to defray the costs of franchise obligations, every grantee shall pay to the city on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the term of its franchise a sum totaling five percent of the grantee's gross revenues. 
(2)  The franchisee fee is in addition to all other fees and all taxes and payments that a franchisee or other person may be required to pay under any federal, state or local law, including any applicable property and amusements taxes, except to the extent that such fees, taxes or assessments are a franchise fee under 47 USC 542. 
(3)  Further, every grantee shall market any bundled services to fairly reflect an appropriate and reasonable division of services among the various services offered. Whether or not a grantee separates services on a subscriber's bill, it will provide to the city the amounts upon which it will pay any applicable use fee and any other applicable taxes or fees based on the provision of communications service and the amounts upon which it will pay the cable service franchise fee. Should a grantee engage in billing practices that, in the determination of the city, do not fairly reflect an appropriate split of communications services and cable television services, the city will notify the grantee in writing of its determination. The parties will meet and discuss in good faith whether the billing practices result in an unfair payment of fees to the city. If the parties do not agree on an appropriate method of determining which charges are subject to use fees and that are subject to the cable service franchise fee, the parties may subject the dispute to arbitration or may resort to other methods of dispute resolution, including litigation. Taxes or fees that are not paid on the appropriate division of the bundled bill, when ultimately paid, will be subject to all interest and penalties provided by the applicable portion of this chapter. 
(4)  Payments due the city under this section shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter, as of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than 45 days after the dates listed in the previous sentence. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report by the grantee showing the basis for the computation and a franchise fee worksheet listing all of the sources of revenues attributable to the operation of the grantee's system. 
(5)  Should any additional monies be due to the city as a result of information contained in the annual financial report of a grantee or by audit as permitted by this chapter, the grantee shall pay such additional monies to the city within 60 days after receipt of notice of same from the city. 
(6)  In the event any franchisee fee or other payment is not made on or before the date specified herein, the franchisee and any other person shall pay interest charges computed from such due date at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city's primary depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed. In addition, unless otherwise prohibited by law, the franchisee shall pay an additional sum of two percent of the amount due to defray the city's additional expenses by reason of the delinquency. 
(7)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this chapter, Code or applicable franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the city or its designee at any time upon reasonable notice and specification of the documents requested to be reviewed. The city's right to audit and the grantee's obligations to retain records related to the franchise fee audit shall expire six years from the date on which each franchise fee payment by the grantee is due. 
(b)  Security fund. Each grantee may be required to maintain a security fund with the city to ensure compliance with this chapter, Code and applicable franchise in an amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise. 
(c)  Bonds, indemnification and insurance. Each grantee shall maintain bonds and insurance with the city in amounts and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise. Each grantee also shall be required to indemnify the city in a manner as set forth in article I of this chapter and in the grantee's franchise. 
(d)  Remedies and enforcement procedure. 
(1)  Whenever the city has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any provision of this chapter or its franchise, including the customer service and telephone availability requirements, the city shall first notify the grantee in writing of the violation and demand correction within a reasonable time that shall not be less than 30 days. If the grantee fails to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no violation exists, if the grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or if the grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than 30 days of a public hearing to be held before the board of aldermen. The notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. This procedure shall apply to all alleged Code or franchise violations, including those in which grounds for revocation are considered. 
(2)  At the public hearing, the board of aldermen shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. 
(3)  In the event the city finds that the grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the city and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. In the event the city finds that a violation exists and that the grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the city may impose penalties or liquidated damages from the security fund, as follows: 
a.  For system construction schedule violations, including, but not limited to, provisions relating to initial construction schedules and system upgrade construction schedule: $500.00 per day of non-compliance; 
b.  For all other violations: $250.00 per day per violation. 
The city shall provide the grantee with written notice of its decision together with a written finding of fact explaining the basis for such a decision. 
(4)  If the city elects to assess penalties or liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute the city's exclusive remedy for a period of 60 days. Thereafter, if the grantee remains in non-compliance, the city may pursue any other available remedy, including franchise revocation. 
(5)  In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of the grantee, the security fund deposited pursuant to the franchise shall remain in effect and available to the city until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any remaining amounts in the security fund shall revert to the possession of the grantee. 
(6)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this chapter, applicable franchise or authorized by law and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right city may have. 
(7)  The foregoing provisions shall not be deemed to preclude the city from obtaining any other available remedies for repeated violations of the same general type, whether remedied or not. 
(e)  Grounds for revocation. In addition to any rights in this chapter or applicable franchise, the city reserves the right to utilize the above-described enforcement procedure to revoke a franchise and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto in the event that any of the following occur and the city and a grantee are not able to mutually agree upon a cure or alternate remedy. 
(1)  The grantee substantially violates any material provision of this chapter or its franchise; 
(2)  The grantee practices an act of fraud or deceit upon the city; or 
(3)  The grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt, provided that any remedy imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not conflict with the requirements of the federal bankruptcy code or other applicable law. 
(f)  Right of appeal. 
(1)  Upon the imposition of a penalty or revocation decision, a grantee shall have a period of 120 days subsequent to the date of the formal adoption of the decision by the board of aldermen within which to file an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(2)  During any such appeal period, the franchise shall remain in full force and effect. 
(Code 2006, § 675.220; Code 2008, § 655.220; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.6), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.220. - Foreclosure, receivership and abandonment. 
(a)  Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of the cable system or upon the termination of any lease covering all or part of the cable system, a grantee shall notify the city of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred. 
(b)  Receivership. The city shall have the right to cancel a franchise 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of the 120 days or unless: 
(1)  Within 120 days after its election or appointment, the receiver or trustee has fully complied with all the provisions of the franchise and remedied all defaults thereunder; and 
(2)  Such receiver or trustee, within the 120 days, has executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter and applicable franchise. 
(Code 2006, § 675.230; Code 2008, § 655.230; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.7), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.230. - Purchase of system. 
    If a renewal or extension of a franchise is denied without further right of appeal or a franchise is lawfully terminated with all rights of appeal exhausted, the city may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be in accordance with and to the extent permitted by 47 USC 547, as follows: 
(1)  Upon revocation of a franchise, such valuation shall not include any sum attributable to the value of the franchise itself and plant and property shall be valued according to its book value at the time of revocation or the cable system's initial cost less depreciation and salvage, whichever of the two is lower. 
(2)  At the expiration of a franchise, such valuation shall be at fair market value, exclusive of the value attributed to the franchise itself. 
(Code 2006, § 675.240; Code 2008, § 655.240; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.8), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.240. - Sale or transfer of franchise. 
(a)  A grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system without the prior consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the city that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the cable system so as to perform its obligations under the franchise. This section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. Consent from the city shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with a grantee. 
(b)  The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this section: 
(1)  The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of a grantee's assets in the city; 
(2)  The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interests in a grantee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in grantee; 
(3)  The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership membership or other equity interest by a grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; and 
(4)  A grantee's agreement to transfer management or operation of the grantee or the system to an unaffiliated entity so as to create a new controlling interest in the grantee. The term "controlling interest," as used herein, means majority equity ownership of a grantee. 
(c)  A transfer solely for security purposes such as the grant of a mortgage or security interest, including the pledge or grant of a mortgage or security interest to lenders of a grantee's assets, including, but not limited to, the franchise such as in a transaction commonly known as an initial public offering, shall not be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system and thus shall not require compliance with this section. 
(d)  The grantee shall submit to the city the application and FCC Form 394 requesting such transfer or assignment consent or comply with other applicable procedure. In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system, the city shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and the requirements of this chapter. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days after receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of the 120-day period. 
(e)  The city reserves any legal right it has under applicable law to require a grantee to pay all costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sale, assignment or transfer of a franchise, including, but not limited to, the city's costs of reviewing the qualifications of any proposed transferees. Such reimbursement shall not be considered a franchise fee. 
(Code 2006, § 675.250; Code 2008, § 655.250; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.9), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.250. - Rights of individuals protected. 
(a)  Discriminatory practices prohibited. A grantee shall not deny cable service, deny access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers or general citizens on the basis of income level, race, color, religion, national origin, sex or age.

Every grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and all executive and administrative orders relating to non-discrimination. 
(b)  Subscriber privacy. Every grantee shall at all times comply with the federal subscriber privacy requirements codified at 47 USC 551. 
(Code 2006, § 675.260; Code 2008, § 655.260; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.10), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.260. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Rate regulation. The city reserves the right to regulate rates for basic cable service and any other services offered over a cable system to the extent permitted by federal or state law. A grantee shall be subject to the rate regulation provisions provided for herein and those of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at 47 CFR 76.900, subpart N. The city shall follow the rules relating to cable rate regulation promulgated by the FCC at 47 CFR 76.900, subpart N. 
(b)  Rights reserved to city. Upon either final non-appealable determination of non-renewal or revocation of a franchise, the city shall have discretion to permit a grantee by mutual consent to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time agreed upon by the parties. Any such operation of the system by a grantee shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of this chapter or franchise and shall provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. 
(Code 2006, § 675.270; Code 2008, § 655.270; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(3.11), 2-18-2004)

Sec. 655.270. - Rights-of-way ordinance. 
    Every provider and ROW user, as defined in section 655.080, shall be subject to and comply with the additional or supplementary terms and conditions of the ROW ordinance, as may be amended from time to time, that is incorporated herein by reference and such provisions and the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a condition of any franchise and agreement.

The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other rights to use the rights-of-way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to all applicable law. The granting of an agreement or franchise shall not be deemed to create any property interest of any kind in favor of the ROW user. All franchises and agreements shall be approved by ordinance of the board of aldermen on a non-discriminatory basis provided that the applicant is in compliance with all applicable requirements. Such franchises and agreements shall be deemed to incorporate the terms of this article and other applicable laws of the city, except as may be expressly stated in such agreements and franchises. 
(c)  Lease required for public lands. Unless otherwise provided, use or installation of any facilities in, on or over non-right-of-way public lands of the city shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms as the city may require. 
(d)  Transferability. Except as provided in this article or as otherwise required by law, no franchise, agreement or permit may be transferred without the written application to and consent of the city based on the requirements and policies of this ROW ordinance.

(8)  Information sufficient to determine whether the ROW user is subject under applicable law to franchising, service regulation, payment of compensation for the use of the right-of-way, taxation, or other requirements of the city. 
(9)  Such other information as may be reasonably required by the city to determine requirements and compliance with applicable regulations.

Sec. 655.350. - Exclusion of certain locations/facilities. 
(a)  Prior to its installation of any facilities in the rights-of-way and after it provides the city with its proposed plans for the facilities, the city may in its discretion designate certain locations or facilities in the rights-of-way to be excluded from use by the provider for its facilities, including, but not limited to, ornamental or similar specially designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment of the city engineer, do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the provider's facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof or any other facility or location that in the reasonable judgment of the city engineer is incompatible with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation. 
(b)  The city engineer may further exclude certain other facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by the provider due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal or other limitations or restrictions as may be reasonably determined by the city. 
(c)  In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable requirements of the provider, the city will cooperate in good faith with the provider to attempt to find suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the city shall not be required to incur financial cost nor require the city to acquire new locations for the provider. 
(Code 2006, § 675.340; Code 2008, § 655.340; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.7), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.360. - Location, type and design of facilities subject to approval. 
(a)  The design, location and nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the city engineer. Such review shall be based on non-discriminatory bases in application of city policy and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(1)  Except as provided herein, all facilities constructed after the date of an agreement shall be placed underground. Antenna or other facilities may be located aboveground only if approved by the city engineer for good cause and including as may be specifically authorized in an exhibit to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that is on file in the city offices. Unless extraordinary circumstances exist, good cause shall not include authorization for aboveground facilities requiring new poles or major modification to existing aboveground structures. 
(2)  Aboveground pedestals, vaults, antennae or other facilities may be installed only if approved by the city where alternative underground facilities are not feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise waived pursuant to this section. Existing conduit shall be used where feasible and available. 
(3)  The location, design and requirements for antennae in the rights-of-way shall additionally be subject to all specific ordinances, regulations or policies of the city generally applicable to the siting of antennae. Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate public rights-of-way exist, the provider shall place aboveground facilities underground in conjunction with city capital improvement projects or at specific locations requested by the city, provided that such placement is practical, efficient and economically feasible. 
(4)  Unless specifically authorized herein or otherwise by the city, antennae/towers having a height of 40 feet or greater located on the rights-of-way or antennae on other city-owned or city-controlled property shall not be authorized by an agreement but shall require a separate lease or use agreement with the city. City height limitations, applicable zoning restrictions and general city policies with regard to all users of the rights-of-way shall also be applicable to all facilities. 
(b)  The city engineer may establish such regulations or policies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to effectuate this provision. 
(Code 2006, § 675.350; Code 2008, § 655.350; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.8), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.370. - Notification, joint trenching and collocation requirements. 
(a)  The provider shall, prior to any excavation or installation within the rights-of-way, provide sufficient notification and joint installation opportunity on a shared-cost basis to potential users of the rights-of-way as may be provided for by separate city policy. Such notification and adopted policies shall be designed to maximize collocation of providers to minimize the disturbance to the rights-of-way and maximize its useable capacity. 
(1)  The provider shall not install new conduit or other facilities in the rights-of-way where existing conduit is available to the provider that would reasonably avoid the need for new excavation or overhead installations. The provider shall identify by mapping, as required by the city engineer, the location and specifications of all conduit available or dedicated for collocation. 
(2)  Any person unreasonably failing to respond to collocation opportunities or otherwise comply with this provision or policies adopted hereunder shall, unless good cause is found by the city, be precluded from use of the rights-of-way for a period of 30 months at such locations that would reasonably have been accommodated by the collocation opportunity that was declined. 
(b)  Where service is to be provided to new subdivisions or construction, providers may be required to use conduit or other previously installed facilities and reimburse the developer pursuant to a reimbursement and specifications policy adopted by the city. 
(Code 2006, § 675.360; Code 2008, § 655.360; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.9), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.380. - Use of facilities by others; required terms. 
    If any provider chooses to make its facilities physically available for use by any other provider, it shall do so only under terms that are fair and reasonable, competitively neutral and non-discriminatory and which do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service under the circumstances. The provider shall further comply with the facilities attachment requirements of federal law codified at 47 USC 224. 
(Code 2006, § 675.370; Code 2008, § 655.370; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.10), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.390. - Additional facilities requirements; planned infrastructure. 
(a)  Except if contrary to governing law, when the provider installs any new conduit, the provider shall, if so directed in writing as part of any permit approval, simultaneously install sufficient additional conduit or other related facilities (excess conduit) as may be determined by the city engineer and in order to reasonably meet the needs of existing and future users of the rights-of-way. 
(1)  The criteria for when such conduit will be required, the amount of conduit to be required, management and ownership of the excess conduit and financing of the excess conduit and related matters shall be established by a separate city policy. Such policy shall be publicly available and each agreement shall be deemed subject to such applicable policies adopted or as may be amended. 
(2)  The excess conduit shall be designed and installed in accordance with city specifications. The city may reserve for its own purposes a portion of any excess conduit dedicated to the city but shall make available any portion not so reserved to any and all subsequent providers (or others as determined by the city) on a non-discriminatory basis for fair and reasonable compensation that shall be paid in addition to the franchise or use fees. 
(3)  When sections of the provider's conduit are installed simultaneously with another provider, the cost of such sections of excess conduit shall also be cost-shared among each provider as may be established by policy. 
(4)  The requirements herein shall be administered and applied so as not to create an obstacle to entry in the market and on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis to maximize the available space in the rights-of-way and designed to minimize the total number of excavations and cost of total communications infrastructure installation. 
(b)  No linear foot charge shall apply to any excess conduit installed by provider and dedicated to the city. 
(Code 2006, § 675.380; Code 2008, § 655.380; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.11), 2-18-2004)

    Upon expiration of an agreement, whether by lapse of time, by agreement between the provider and the city or by forfeiture thereof, the provider shall remove, at its sole cost, from public property any and all of its facilities that are the subject of an agreement within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed 90 days and it shall be the duty of provider immediately upon such removal to restore the rights-of-way from which the facilities are removed to as good condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as required by the city. The provider shall further, unless otherwise consented to by the city, remove all facilities that have not been used for a period of more than one year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request of the provider, the city may allow underground facilities to be left in place when it is not practical or desirable to require removal. 
(Code 2006, § 675.390; Code 2008, § 655.390; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.12), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.410. - Relocation of facilities. 
    Whenever the city shall in its exercise of the public interest request of the provider the relocation or reinstallation of any of its facilities, the provider shall forthwith remove, relocate or reinstall any such property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request and the cost of such relocation, removal or reinstallation of the facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of the provider. The provider shall, upon request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly issued building or moving permit of the city and within 48 hours prior to the date upon which the person intends to exercise its rights under the permit, thereupon temporarily raise, lower or relocate its wires or other facilities as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit and the provider may require such permit holder to make payment in advance for any expenses incurred by the provider pursuant to the person's request. 
(Code 2006, § 675.400; Code 2008, § 655.400; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.13), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.420. - No cause of action against the city. 
(a)  The provider shall have no damages remedy or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any agreement or because of the enforcement thereof by the city or for the failure of the city to have the authority to grant all or any part of the rights herein granted; provided that the provider expressly acknowledges that it accepted the rights herein granted in reliance upon its independent and personal investigation and understanding of the power of authority of the city to enter into the agreement herein with the provider; provided further that the provider acknowledges by its acceptance of the agreement that it has not been induced to enter into an agreement upon any understanding or promise, whether given verbally or in writing, by or on behalf of the city or by any other person concerning any term or condition of an agreement not expressed herein; provided further that the provider acknowledges by the acceptance of an agreement that it has carefully read the provisions, terms and conditions hereof and is willing to and does accept all of the risk attendant to the provisions, terms and conditions. 
(b)  Nothing herein shall preclude provider from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the city where such relief is otherwise available and the requirements therefor are otherwise satisfied; provided, however, that the validity of an executed agreement shall not be subject to challenge. 
(Code 2006, § 675.410; Code 2008, § 655.410; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.14), 2-18-2004)

All such costs shall be itemized and the city's books and records related to these costs shall be made available upon request to the provider. The provider shall be responsible for its own costs incurred removing or relocating its facilities when required by the city due to city requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for city purposes. A permit and inspection fee may be charged by the city consistent with applicable law. 
(Code 2006, § 675.420; Code 2008, § 655.420; Ord. No. 2086, § 1(4.15), 2-18-2004) 
Sec. 655.440. - Insurance and bonds. 
    During the term of an agreement, the provider shall obtain and maintain at the provider's sole expense all insurance and bonds required by the ROW ordinance or applicable agreement or franchise.

Sec. 710.010. - General policy; backflow prevention/cross-connection control. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is: 
(1)  To establish regulations, requirements and guidelines for the protection of the public potable water supply from the introduction of actual and potential contaminants or pollutants should backflow occur. 
(2)  To promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial process systems. 
(3)  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of backflow prevention and cross-connection control which will systemically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
(b)  Application. This chapter shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water system of the city and the water purveyor. 
(c)  Policy. This chapter will be reasonably interpreted by the water purveyor. It is the water purveyor's intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
(1)  The water purveyor shall be primarily responsible for protection of the public potable water distribution system from backflow of contaminants and pollutants through the water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement and maintain the program to control cross-connections and prevent backflow. The water consumer shall be responsible for preventing pollution of the public potable water supply. 
(2)  If, in the judgment of the water purveyor or its authorized representative, cross-connection protection is required through either piping modification, abandonment or installation of a state-approved backflow prevention device, due notice shall be given to the consumer, and the consumer shall immediately comply by providing the required protection at his own expense. Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the consumer's premises until such time the required protection has been provided. 
(d)  Definition. As used in this section, the term "water purveyor" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in section 710.020.

Sec. 720.370. - Discharge of hazardous waste. 
    Discharge of hazardous waste is prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.370, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.380. - Analytical requirements. 
    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the superintendent or other parties approved by EPA. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.380, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.390. - Sample collection. 
    Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in section 720.290 and section 720.310, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 720.320 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.490, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.500. - Show cause hearing. 
(a)  The director of public works at the recommendation of the superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director of public works, city administrator and city attorney and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in section 720.010 and required by section 720.200(a). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(b)  The director of public works, city administrator and city attorney may conduct the hearing and take the evidence or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the wastewater department to: 
(1)  Issue in the name of the director of public works, city administrator and city attorney notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings. 
(2)  Take evidence. 
(3)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with reconsideration to the director of public works, city administrator and city attorney for action thereon. 
(c)  At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript so recorded will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefor. 
(d)  After the director of public works, city administrator and city attorney have reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.500, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.510. - Compliance orders. 
    When the director of public works at the recommendation of the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director of public works may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.510, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.520. - Cease and desist orders. 
    When the director of public works at the recommendation of the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director of public works may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Sec. 720.540. - Emergency suspensions. 
(a)  The director of public works at the recommendation of the superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director of public works may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director of public works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director of public works at the recommendation of the superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of director of public works that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 720.550 are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 720.490 or 720.550. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.540, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.550. - Termination of discharge. 
(a)  In addition to the provisions in section 720.260, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in article II of this chapter. 
(b)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 720.490 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director of public works shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

    The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.580, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.590. - Supplemental enforcement action; water supply severance. 
    Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.590, 12-13-2017) 
ARTICLE X. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 720.600. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.600, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.610. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 720.050(a) or the specific prohibitions in section 720.050(b) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2017-3804, § 720.610, 12-13-2017) 
Sec. 720.620. - Bypass. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Bypass notifications. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Prohibited and anticipated bypass.
