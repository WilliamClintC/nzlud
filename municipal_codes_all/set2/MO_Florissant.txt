employee. An eligible employee is only entitled to a total of twelve (12) weeks leave in any twelve
(12) month period regardless of the number of qualifying conditions that may arise in any twelve
(12) month period.
For any leave taken in accordance with this Section, each employee is required to substitute
accrued paid vacation and accrued paid sick leave to the extent available in the following manner:
Sick leave. For any leave taken under this Section because of the employee's own serious
health condition, including birth of a child, the employee is required to substitute all accrued
paid sick leave while on leave.
Vacation. For any leave taken under this Section for whatever reason, the employee is
required to substitute all accrued paid vacation while on leave.
An employee on leave in accordance with this Section during any of the holidays designated in
Section 125.295 of the Code will not be compensated for said holiday(s) unless the holiday falls
within the accrued paid sick leave or vacation substituted for any portion of the leave, in which
case the employee receives his/her regular pay.
A husband and wife who are both employed by the City are permitted to take only a combined
total of twelve (12) weeks leave during a twelve (12) month period if the leave is taken: for the
birth of a child or to care for the child following birth; for placement of a child for adoption or foster
care or to care for the child after placement; or to care for a parent with a serious health condition.
Each spouse is entitled to twelve (12) weeks of leave during a twelve (12) month period if the
leave is for his/her serious health condition or the serious health condition of the other spouse or
child.
An employee's entitlement to leave for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of a child
expires at the end of the twelve (12) month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement.
All employees requesting leave under this Section are required to provide thirty (30) days'
advance written notice of the need to take leave if the need for the leave is foreseeable based on
an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care of a child, or planned medical treatment
for a serious health condition of the employee or of a family member. If thirty (30) days' notice is
not practicable under the circumstances, such as because of the lack of knowledge of
approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical
emergency, notice must be given as soon as practicable. The notice under this Section must set
forth the reason(s) for the requested leave, the anticipated duration of the leave and the
anticipated start of the leave. Notice should be given to the employee's immediate supervisor.
An employee undergoing planned medical treatment must consult with his/her supervisor and
make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employer's
operations, consistent with the health care provider's medical judgment.
When leave is taken because of the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care, an
employee may take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only upon approval of the
employee's department head. When leave is taken to care for an employee's own serious health
condition or for a sick family member, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave
schedule at the employee's request and when medically necessary.
An employee that takes leave under this Section for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health
condition, or because of the employee's own serious health condition, must provide written
certification of the serious health condition issued by the health care provider for the employee or
the employee's ill family member. The certification is due fifteen (15) days after the City's written
request for certification directed to the employee. The City will provide a form certification to the
employee requesting leave at the time the certification is requested by the City. The certification of
a serious health condition must include the following:

ARTICLE IX. General Employment Policies
Section 125.600. Equal Employment Opportunity, Anti-
Harassment and Non-Discrimination Policy.
[Ord. No. 7328 §1, 8-28-2006]
It is the policy and practice of the City to provide and promote equal employment opportunities for
all applicants and employees. It is the responsibility of all employees to ensure that the concepts
of equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination are understood, abided by and carried
out by everyone.
It is the policy of the City to hire, train, promote, compensate and administer all employment
practices without regard to race, color, sex, pregnancy, age, veteran status, religion, national
origin, handicap or disability unrelated to the ability to perform a job. This policy also prohibits
"same sex" harassment. In short, discrimination, sexual harassment or harassment on any of the
grounds stated above is strictly forbidden and will not be tolerated. The City will take appropriate
measures in response to any such incidents which are known by or reported to management or
the Personnel Department.
The City believes that every employee has the right to work in an environment free of
discrimination, sexual or other prohibited harassment. Such conduct does not advance the
purposes of the City; it is also morally wrong and may subject the City to legal exposure.
Consequently, any employee who engages in this prohibited conduct will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
Conduct Constituting Prohibited Sexual Harassment. Under guidelines published by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature" constitute unlawful harassment in the
following instances:
When submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
employment; or
When submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for any
employment decision (e.g. promotion, wage increase, termination) affecting such individual;
or
When such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's
work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

For example and without compiling an exhaustive list, the following are illustrative of
conduct that the City condemns and prohibits under this policy:
Conditioning a benefit such as a certain salary or promotion on the granting of sexual
favors or the establishment or continuance of a personal relationship or to imply to an
employee that an award of such a benefit is conditioned upon the granting of sexual
favors or the establishment or continuance of a personal relationship.
Stating or implying that another employee's performance is attributable in whole or in part
to the sex of that employee.
Stating or implying that a fellow employee's promotion in the City hierarchy has resulted
from the granting of a sexual favor or relationship.
Sexual harassment may involve such matters as crude sexual jokes or sexual
names; sexually suggestive, profane language; offensive sexual flirtations and
innuendos; a display of obscene or pornographic material; sexual advances;
grabbing or touching another individual; or other similar demeaning and insulting
behavior based on sex. Employees of the City should be aware that the issue of
whether conduct constitutes sexual harassment or discriminatory conduct may
depend on how that conduct is viewed by the employee who is subjected to the
conduct. Any employee who initiates or persists in this prohibited conduct assumes
the risk of violating this policy in the event that the person who is the object of the
conduct views it as offensive; accordingly, such an employee may be subject to
discipline even if the conduct might not have been intended as offensive.
Prohibited Discriminatory Joking Or Epithets Based On Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Religion, Age Or
Disability. As examples and without compiling an exhaustive list, the following are illustrative of
conduct the City condemns and prohibits under this policy:
It is prohibited for any employee to bring any item to the work premises for purposes of a
racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, age-related or disability-related joke or epithet.
It is also prohibited for any employee to use City property, bulletin boards, e-mail or voice mail
systems or documents for purposes of a racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, age-related or
disability-related joke or epithet.
It is also prohibited for any employee to deface City property or the personal property of
anyone else for purposes of a racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, age-related or disability-related
joke or epithet.
It is also prohibited for any employee to utter or use any racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, agerelated
or disability-related jokes or epithets at work or when referring to or about any other
person, be they an employee or a non-employee.
Procedure Upon Occurrence Of Prohibited Conduct. Any employee who believes he/she has been
subjected or exposed to any harassment or other conduct prohibited by this policy has the right to
have such activity terminated immediately. Complaints must be made either to the employee's
immediate supervisor, department head or to the City's Personnel Officer or Mayor. Complaints
shall be treated in a confidential manner to the extent reasonable. Retaliation of any form against
anyone who complains pursuant to this policy is strictly prohibited. An investigation shall be made
immediately concerning any complaint. If the investigation leads to a determination that the
charges are true or there has been any improper conduct, corrective action will be taken
immediately. Such action may include termination of employment for anyone violating this policy.
Any complaint against the Mayor should be made to the Personnel Officer who shall do a prompt
and thorough investigation. A report of such investigation shall be forwarded to the Council for its
review and determination of appropriate action to be taken against the Mayor.

Section 125.650. Policy Regarding Reasonable Accommodations
For Qualified Individuals With A Disability.
[Ord. No. 7328 §1, 8-28-2006]
Overview. The City stands committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Americans With
Disabilities Act and all other applicable State and Federal Statutes governing the workplace. It is
the policy of the City to hire, train, promote, compensate and administer all employment practices
without regard to race, color, sex, age, religion, veteran status, national origin or disability
unrelated to the ability to perform a job with or without reasonable accommodation. Discrimination
against job applicants or employees because they are disabled is prohibited and will not be
tolerated.
Guidelines. When dealing with situations involving job applicants or employees with a disability,
the City will endeavor to follow these guidelines:
It is against the policy of the City to discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities
who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of a job.
The City is committed to ensuring that qualified individuals with a disability are not
discriminated against in applying for employment and once such individuals have been
employed in the workplace. It is the policy of the City, where possible and readily achievable,
to make existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals
with disabilities. However, there may be instances where the City is not aware that an
employee has a disability which might impact on an aspect of his/her employment or whether
an existing facility is accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. It is incumbent
upon any job applicant or employee to alert the City or his/her supervisor as to the existence
of a disability which the job applicant or employee believes needs to be accommodated so
that he/she will enjoy and be afforded equal employment opportunity in the workplace.
An individual may be considered disabled if he/she has a physical or mental impairment and
the impairment substantially limits one (1) or more of the individual's major activities in life,
has a record or history of such an impairment, or is perceived as having such an impairment.
The City is committed to making reasonable accommodations in job duties, the work
environment, and the application process to enable a qualified person with a disability to
enjoy equal employment opportunities, so long as such accommodations do not constitute an
undue hardship.
At the same time, the City also has an obligation to provide a safe work environment for all
employees and customers. Reasonable precautions will be taken to ensure that an
employee's disability, or any attempted reasonable accommodations thereto, do not present a
direct threat to the health and/or safety of the individual employee with a disability or to
others.
Procedural Channels. The employee should advise his/her supervisor of the existence of a
disability which the employee believes needs to be accommodated so that he/she will have equal
employment opportunities in the workplace. The City will attempt to work with the employee to
determine if the employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated. Employees also should
advise their department head, the Personnel Officer or the Mayor of any facilities which they
believe need to be made accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. In addition, the
employee may contact his/her supervisor, department head, the Personnel Officer or the Mayor if
he/she believes that he/she has been discriminated against by reason of a disability. Any
complaint of disability discrimination shall be investigated and treated in a confidential manner to
the extent reasonable. If the investigation leads to a determination that the charges are true,
corrective action will be taken immediately.

Section 125.700. Workplace Violence Policy.
[Ord. No. 7328 §1, 8-28-2006]
Overview. The City is concerned about the increased violence in society, which has also filtered
into many workplaces throughout the United States, and has taken steps to help prevent incidents
of violence from occurring at the City. In this connection, it is the policy of the City to expressly
prohibit any acts or threats of violence by any City employee against any other employee in or
about the City's facilities or elsewhere at any time. The City also will not condone any acts or
threats of violence against the City's employees, customers or visitors on the City's premises at
any time or while they are engaged in business with or on behalf of the City, on or off the City's
premises.
Objectives. In keeping with the spirit and intent of this policy, it is the stated commitment of the
City:
To provide a safe and healthful work environment;
To take prompt remedial action, up to and including immediate termination, against any
employee who engages in any threatening behavior or acts of violence or uses any obscene,
abusive or threatening language or gestures;
To take appropriate action when dealing with customers, former employees or visitors to the
City's property who engage in such behavior. Such action may include notifying the Police or
other law enforcement personnel and prosecuting violators of this policy to the maximum
extent of the law. The City intends to use all reasonable legal, managerial, administrative and
disciplinary procedures to secure the workplace from violence and to reasonably protect
employees from harm;
To prohibit employees, former employees, customers and visitors from bringing unauthorized
firearms or other weapons onto the City's premises; and
To establish a procedure for reporting a complaint of workplace violence and investigating any
complaint of workplace violence.

destroy property;
A reasonable person would perceive as menacing or which would be reasonably interpreted

Electronic mail (e-mail) and voice mail are used prevalently for external and internal
communications. This is an efficient, cost-effective way of communicating, either internally within
an office, between offices or externally with others. By design, these systems permit us to
communicate without producing a physical record of the communication.
It is important to be aware, however, that records (either electronic or voice) of these
communications are created and may remain in the system. Accordingly, it is critical that
employees use appropriate precautions when sending e-mail messages and using voice mail.
Both the subject matter and form of e-mail communications should be of a business nature. The
content of voice mail communications should, likewise, be business related. When preparing
messages, it is best to assume that they may, at some point, be viewed or heard by someone
other than the intended recipient(s). All messages created, sent or received using the e-mail
system or voice mail remain the property of the City.
Employees using the e-mail system and voice mail for personal purposes do so at their own risk.
All passcodes or passwords are the property of the City. No employee may use a passcode or
password that has not been issued to that employee or that is unknown to the City.
The City retains the right to review, audit, intercept, access and disclose any business or personal
message created, sent or received on the e-mail system or by using voice mail and no employee
should have any expectation of privacy regarding any such communications. To ensure that the
use of electronic and telephonic communication (voice mail) systems and business equipment is
consistent with the City's legitimate business interests, authorized representatives of the City may
monitor the use of such equipment from time to time. Such monitoring may include printing or
reading all e-mail entering, leaving or stored in these systems or reviewing or monitoring voice
mail messages.
Improper use of the City's communications services and equipment will result in discipline, up to
and including termination. Improper use includes any misuse as described in this policy as well as
harassing, offensive, demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive written, recorded or
electronically transmitted messages.
Internet access should be for business use only during working hours. Internet access for personal
use is permissible during non-working hours so long as such use does not involve any
inappropriate or offensive material. Internet access is not available for any employee who does not
use a City computer as part of the employee's regular and usual duties. All City Internet users
need to be aware at all times that the Internet is an open environment that may not be secure. You
must govern your use of the Internet accordingly. Information transmitted over the Internet,
whether by Internet e-mail or as responses entered on Internet web or other sites, may be nonsecure
and may be logged or viewed by audiences other than those you intend to address.
Activities on the Internet can be traced to the address from which they originate. It is critical that
you be mindful of who may view the information on the Internet. It is your responsibility to take
precautions to protect privileged and confidential information and to ensure that your Internet
activities reflect well on the City. Internet usage for any sexually suggestive, pornographic, lewd or
indecent material is absolutely prohibited.
Employees who violate this policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

It is the policy of the City to maintain a safe, healthy and productive work environment for
all employees and the City's residents. To that end, the City will act to eliminate any use,
possession, concealment, sale or distribution of illegal or unauthorized drugs and
alcoholic beverages which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism,
substandard performance, poor employee morale, or tends to undermine public
confidence in the City's workforce. Generally, any substance which may affect the
employee's senses, motor functions or alter the individual's perception while working falls
within this policy. This prohibition applies during working hours and non-working hours if
the off-duty use impacts job performance.
This policy provides guidelines for the detection and deterrence of alcohol and drug
abuse. It also outlines the responsibilities of management and employees. All employees
covered by this policy should be aware that violations of the policy may result in
discipline, up to and including termination. Applicants in violation of this policy will not be
hired.
In recognition of the serious duty entrusted to employees of the City and with the
knowledge that drugs and alcohol do hinder a person's ability to perform duties safely
and effectively, the following policy against drugs and alcohol is hereby adopted by the
City.
Policy.
The use, possession, concealment, sale or distribution of unauthorized drug or alcohol is
absolutely prohibited. It is City policy that employees shall not: report to work with any
detectable amount of an unauthorized drug or alcohol or be under the influence of
alcohol or drugs; have the odor of alcohol or drugs on their breath during a regularly
scheduled shift; possess drugs or alcohol on their person or property under their control,
while on duty or on compensated standby time; sell or provide drugs or alcohol to any
other employees or to any person while such employee is on duty; test positive for
unauthorized drugs or alcohol; or work impaired as a result of the use of alcohol or drugs.
The use of medically prescribed medications and drugs is not per se a violation of this
policy. However, an employee should notify his/her supervisor, before beginning work,
when taking medication or drugs which may interfere with the safe and effective
performance of duties or operation of City equipment. In the event there is a question
regarding an employee's ability to safely and effectively perform assigned duties while
using such medication or drugs, clearance from a qualified physician will be required.
The City has established a voluntary Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to assist
those employees who voluntarily seek help for alcohol or drug problems. Telephone
numbers for the EAP are listed on posters in the workplace, on periodic payroll stuffers
and in the employee newsletter. Medical insurance coverage for drug and alcohol
treatment is also included in the medical plan offered by the City. Employees wishing to
obtain more information on any of these benefits should contact the Personnel Officer,
the City's health insurance carrier or the Employee Assistance Program.
The City reserves the right to search, without employee consent, all areas and property in
which the City maintains joint control with the employee or full control. All City vehicles
are subject to search by appropriate management personnel. Warrants will be obtained
should it become necessary to search areas beyond the City's immediate control.
Employees reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall be
prevented from engaging in further work. The employee shall be instructed to wait for a
reasonable time until an authorized City representative can transport the employee from
the work site.

Violations of this policy will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including
discharge. Refusal to submit immediately to an alcohol and/or drug analysis when
requested by management pursuant to provisions of this substance abuse policy will
result in termination.
Employee responsibilities. An employee must:
Not report to work or be subject to duty while having any detectable prohibited drug or

Management responsibilities and guidelines.
All management and supervisors are responsible for consistent enforcement of this
policy. Any supervisor who knowingly permits a violation of this policy by employees
under his/her direct supervision shall be subject to disciplinary action.
Any management or supervisory representative may request that an employee submit to
a drug and/or alcohol analysis when there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee is
intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or alcohol or is otherwise in violation of any
provision of this policy. "Reasonable suspicion" is a belief based on objective and
articulable facts sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent supervisor to suspect that an
employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol so that the employee's ability to
perform the functions of the job is impaired or so that the employee's ability to perform
his/her job safely is reduced or that the employee is otherwise in violation of any
provision of this policy. For example, any of the following, alone or in combination, may
constitute reasonable suspicion:
Slurred speech;
Alcohol on breath;
Inability to walk a straight line;
An accident involving City property;

Arrest or conviction for a substance abuse offense or being the subject of a criminal
investigation into illegal drug possession, use or trafficking;
Evidence that the employee has previously tampered with a previous drug test.
This list is not intended to be all inclusive of conduct which
constitutes reasonable suspicion.
Drug/alcohol tests shall be required for employees whenever there is a pattern of on-duty
accidents, an accident resulting in property damage or any on-the-job injury.
Any supervisor who has reasonable suspicion that an employee is impaired on the job by
alcohol or other substance or is otherwise in violation of any term of this policy will, with
the approval of the department head, immediately arrange for a substance screening
through the Personnel Department. If a screening is required after normal business
hours, the supervisor will make direct contact with the facility that has been designated to
perform screenings for the City. The following procedures shall be followed:
The supervisor should document in writing the facts constituting reasonable
suspicion that the employee in question is impaired on the job by alcohol or other
substance or is otherwise in violation of any term of this policy.
Any supervisor requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis
shall be responsible for the employee's transport to the City's designated facility
where a drug and/or alcohol analysis will be performed.
Any supervisor encountering an employee who refuses to submit to a drug and/or
alcohol analysis upon request shall remind the employee of the requirements and
consequences of this policy. Such continued refusal will constitute grounds for
termination.
Supervisors shall not physically search employees.
Supervisors shall notify the Police Department when they have reasonable suspicion
to believe that an employee may have illegal drugs in his/her possession or in an
area not jointly or fully controlled by the City.
Supervisors shall not confiscate, without consent, prescription drugs or medications
from an employee.
Results of drug and/or alcohol analysis.
Upon a negative result, the employee shall return to work.
If the test result is positive, the employee will then be given the opportunity, at the
employee's expense, to have an additional test performed on the retained specimen.

If the additional test shows a negative result, it will be assumed that the individual is
not in violation of this policy, and the employee shall return to work. If negative, the
City will reimburse the employee for the expense of the additional screen.
If both tests indicate a positive result, the employee's department head shall have
the authority to determine appropriate discipline including termination, subject to the
review or approval by the Mayor or his/her authorized designee. A single offense
may result in immediate termination of employment.
Pre-employment substance screening and procedure.
Prospective employees will be screened for a range of chemical substances. Any
employment offer is conditional on a negative substance screening. Refusal to consent to
and participate in such testing will automatically disqualify the applicant from further
hiring considerations.
The drug screen may test for any substance which could impair an employee's ability to
effectively and safely perform the functions of his/her job. The type(s) of screening and
the levels of substances which constitute a positive screen will be determined
administratively after consultation with the City's medical services provider(s).
An applicant whose initial substance screen shows a positive result will be given the
opportunity, at the applicant's expense, to have an additional screen performed on the
retained specimen. If the additional screen of the same sample shows a negative result,
the individual will not be disqualified from City employment on account of the previous
substance screen. If the additional screen of the same sample confirms the positive test
result, the applicant will be disqualified from consideration for City employment for twelve
(12) months.
Severability. The provisions of this policy are severable and, if any of its provisions shall be
held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any competent jurisdiction, the decision of such
court shall not affect any of the remaining provisions.
Additional Provisions Applicable To Safety-Sensitive Employees. All City employees who perform
job duties requiring a commercial driver's license (CDL) are also subject to the rules of the Federal
Highway Administration (FHA) adopted pursuant to the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing
Act of 1991. A summary of those rules and the City's program/policy is as follows:
Employees covered. Beginning January 1, 1996, all employees of the City who hold
commercial driver's licenses (CDL) and all applicants for positions with assigned duties that
require a CDL are covered by the FHA rules and regulations.
Prohibited alcohol and substance abuse related conduct. Employees required to have a CDL
for their position are subject to the following prohibitions in addition to those defined
elsewhere in the City's policy against substance abuse:
No driver shall report to duty or remain on duty with a blood alcohol concentration of two
hundredths percent (0.02%) or greater;
No driver shall possess or use alcohol, including any medication with an alcohol
component, while on duty or while operating a commercial motor vehicle;
No driver shall be allowed to drive within four (4) hours of using alcohol;
A driver involved in an accident that requires an alcohol test may not use any alcohol
until after the test is completed or eight (8) hours have elapsed;
No driver shall refuse to submit to any required drug or alcohol test required by postaccident,
random, reasonable suspicion or follow-up testing requirements as defined

No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty when using any controlled substances
except those a physician has advised that the driver may use which will not adversely
affect the driver's performance.
Drug/alcohol tests required by this policy. The City is required to administer the following
types of tests for persons operating commercial motor vehicles:
Pre-employment[1] testing for drugs. Offers of employment are made contingent on
successfully passing drug screening tests.
Includes testing when a current employee who is not required to hold a CDL transfers
into a position requiring the operation of a commercial motor vehicle.
Post-accident testing. Drivers will be given drug and alcohol tests within two (2) hours of
an accident involving property damage or bodily injury or an accident when the driver is
cited for a moving traffic violation. In cases of post-accident testing, the employee will be
transported to a medical facility or the City will request and conduct a breath test at the
worksite.
Random testing. Drivers must participate in random drug and alcohol test pools. The
random test rate of the alcohol testing pool shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of
the drivers annually and for the drug testing pool at least fifty percent (50%) of the drivers
annually. The tests will be spread throughout the calendar year. "Random selection"
means that an individual commercial driver may be selected for alcohol and/or drug
testing several times in one (1) calendar year or not at all.
Reasonable suspicion testing. Drivers are subject to drug and/or alcohol testing at any
time during, immediately prior to, or immediately after the driver's assigned working
hours, when based upon reasonable suspicion as defined in this policy. In cases of
reasonable suspicion testing, the employee will be transported to a medical facility or the
City will request and conduct a breath test at the worksite.
Return to duty and follow-up testing. Before a worker who has violated the prohibited
conduct of this policy may return to work, he/she must take and pass drug and/or alcohol
tests. Follow-up tests are to be given at least six (6) times within the first (1st) year after
the employee returns to duty following completion of a rehabilitation program.
Testing procedures. Drug and alcohol testing procedures shall conform to those required by
Federal regulations governing the drug and alcohol testing mandated by the Department of
Transportation. All drug tests shall be done by a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
certified laboratory.
Specimen collection. The Personnel Department will instruct job applicants to report to
the testing site. Current employees will be instructed by the department head where and
when to report for drug and/or alcohol testing. In cases of post-accident or reasonable
suspicion testing, the employee will be transported to a medical facility or the City will
request and conduct a breath test at the worksite.
The procedure for collecting urine specimens will be designed to ensure the integrity and
identity of the urine specimen that is produced. The procedure will also allow for
individual privacy unless, in the determination of the City, the laboratory or the Medical
Review Officer (MRO), there is reason to believe that an employee may alter or
substitute the specimen. Breath alcohol testing will follow Federal procedures to ensure
accuracy, reliability and confidentiality.
If testing under this policy is ever required of an employee who is in need of medical
attention, necessary medical attention will not be delayed in order to collect the test
specimen. However, such an employee shall promptly, upon request from the City,

provide the necessary authorization for obtaining hospital reports and records and any
other information at the time the need for medical attention and/or testing arose.
Nature of tests.
Drug testing. Drug testing will be performed on urine samples. The initial test will be
done by the Enzyme Immunochemical Assay Method (EMIT) or a similarly approved
testing method. All specimens identified as a positive test on the initial test will be
confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. A
specimen will be treated as negative if the result of the initial test or the confirmatory
test is negative. All urine samples will be split samples so that if the original
specimen test is positive, the employee may request the retained sample be tested.
This request must be received by the MRO in writing within seventy-two (72) hours
of employee's notice of a positive result. The split sample will be tested at the
employee's expense. If the second (2nd) test is negative, the test will be deemed to
be negative and the cost of the test for the split sample will be paid for by the City or
reimbursed to the employee if already paid by the employee. Job applicants do not
have the right to split samples.
Alcohol testing. Alcohol testing will be done by using evidential breath testing
devices (EBT) approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Two
(2) breath tests are required to determine if a person has a prohibited alcohol
concentration. Breath alcohol testing requires the individual to provide a breath
sample. Should the initial breath sample have a result of two-hundredths percent
(0.02%) blood alcohol content or greater, a confirmation test will be conducted within
twenty (20) minutes using an EBT that prints out the results, date and time, a
sequential number, and the name and serial number of the EBT to ensure reliability
of the results. A positive test will be reported to the City only if the initial and
confirmatory tests measure a blood alcohol concentration at or above twohundredths
percent (0.02%) by weight.
Refusal to test. All employees covered by this policy are required to submit to the alcohol
or drug tests as provided herein. If an employee refuses to be tested or alters or attempts
to alter the test sample, such actions shall be treated as a positive test in addition to
being a violation of this policy. Such a refusal is grounds for immediate termination.
Test results.
Drug tests. The Medical Review Officer (MRO) will review positive drug test results with
the employee before they are reported to the City to determine if there is a legitimate
medical explanation to account for the laboratory results. The Medical Review Officer will
report to the City whether an employee's drug test was positive or negative. If positive,
the substance(s) for which the test was positive will be identified. The Medical Review
Officer may advise the City of a positive test result without having communicated with the
tested employee about the test results if the employee expressly declines the opportunity
to discuss the results of the test, or if the employee cannot be reached after reasonable
effort by the Medical Review Officer.
Following a positive test result, the employee will be removed from his/her safetysensitive
function until, at a minimum, the employee undergoes evaluation and, when
necessary, rehabilitation; after a substance abuse professional (SAP) determines that the
employee has successfully complied with any required rehabilitation; and after the
employee takes a return-to-duty test with a verified negative test result.
If the Medical Review Officer determines there is a legitimate medical explanation for the
positive test result, the Medical Review Officer will report the test result to the City as
negative.

Alcohol tests. If an alcohol breath test results in a reading of two-hundredths to thirty-nine
hundredths percent (0.02 — 0.39%) blood alcohol content, the individual shall not return
to duty but shall be taken off duty and not returned to work for at least twenty-four (24)
hours. If an alcohol breath test results in a reading of four-hundredths percent (0.04%)
blood alcohol content or greater, in addition to the above, the employee must meet with a
substance abuse professional (SAP). The SAP will determine what assistance, if any, the
employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol use and when the
employee may return to work.
Confidentiality. The results of any positive test shall be kept confidential from the general
City work force and public. The results may be known to the employee, test facility, the
Medical Review Officer and substance abuse professional and those department heads
necessary. The City may use the results to determine the appropriate response to
employee drug and/or alcohol use and to support its disciplinary or other actions or to
defend the City in a court or administrative hearing.
The Medical Review Officer, substance abuse professional and the City shall not release
the individual test results of any employee to any unauthorized party without first
obtaining written authorization from the tested individual.
Actions taken in response to test results — refusal to be tested.
Refusal/what constitutes refusal. An employee who refuses to be tested will be treated as
having had a positive test. Failure to report to a collection site on a timely basis, sign any
required consent form or otherwise fail to fully cooperate with the testing procedure shall
be treated as a refusal to be tested. Employees refusing to be tested shall be subject to
immediate termination.
Positive drug test. An employee whose drug test result is reported to the City as positive
shall be immediately referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation and may
be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
Alcohol test.
An employee whose breath test results in a reading of two-hundredths to thirty-nine
hundredths percent (0.02 — 0.39%) blood alcohol content shall be removed from
duty and not returned to work for at least twenty-four (24) hours, and all hours not
worked shall be recorded as lost time. An employee who has a continuing pattern of
breath test results between two-hundredths to thirty-nine hundredths percent (0.02
— 0.39%) blood alcohol content shall be referred to a substance abuse professional
for evaluation and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
dismissal.
An employee whose breath test results in a reading of four-hundredths percent
(0.04%) blood alcohol content or greater shall be removed from duty and not
returned to work for at least twenty-four (24) hours, and all hours not worked shall be
recorded as lost time. Additionally, the employee shall be referred to a substance
abuse professional for evaluation and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including dismissal.
Subsequent positive test(s). An employee whose drug test result is reported to the City
as positive or whose breath test result is four-hundredths percent (0.04%) blood alcohol
content or greater and who has previously had positive drug tests or previous breath
tests with a result greater than four-hundredths percent (0.04%) blood alcohol content or
who has previously been referred to a rehabilitation program under the provisions of this
policy shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
Rehabilitation. Failure to immediately begin an approved rehabilitation program,

Department heads or their designees must produce drivers for post-accident drug and
alcohol testing within two (2) hours of the accident or explain in writing why the driver was
not produced. The driver may be given necessary medical treatment and if such
treatment prevents normal drug or alcohol testing, the supervisor shall immediately
inform the City's Personnel Director.
Whenever drug or alcohol tests are required under this policy, department heads must
produce the driver for those tests, and when current impairment is reasonably suspected,
the department head or designee shall not allow the employee to drive.
Observations supporting a department head's reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol
use must be made just before, during or just after the employee operates a commercial
motor vehicle. These observations must be reduced to writing within twenty-four (24)
hours of the observation.
Whenever drug or alcohol tests are required by this policy and the employee is not tested
within eight (8) hours of notice of the need to test, the department head shall explain in
writing why the test or tests were not performed.
Review of test results. The City will employ a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to review the
drug test results. The MRO shall be a licensed physician with knowledge of drug abuse
disorders.
Return to work — drug test. In order to recommend return to work after a positive drug test,
the MRO shall ensure the employee has subsequently tested drug free, been evaluated by a
rehabilitation program counselor, and ensure the employee is in compliance with rehabilitation
conditions.

Only the Medical Review Officer may review and interpret each positive drug test and,
after conferring with the employee, report the results to the City.
Substance abuse professional. The City will also employ a substance abuse professional
(SAP). The SAP shall be a licensed physician (M.D. or D.O.) or a licensed psychologist,
social worker, employee assistance professional or an addiction counselor (certified by
MHADACCC) with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of
alcohol-related disorders.
Return to work — alcohol test.
In order to recommend return to work after an alcohol test which indicates a blood
alcohol content greater than four-hundredths percent (0.04%), the SAP must first
evaluate the employee to determine whether the employee has an alcohol problem.
If it is determined by the SAP that an employee has an alcohol problem which requires
assistance, the employee shall be subject to counseling, treatment and follow-up alcohol
testing as directed by the SAP. Follow-up testing shall only occur just before, during or
just after the employee operates a commercial motor vehicle.
Consequences. Besides the penalties set out by the City for violations of this policy, the
following consequences are required by FHA rules:
No driver may drive if he/she has used a listed drug and no driver may drive within four
(4) hours of using alcohol or at any time when an alcohol test indicates an alcohol
concentration of four-hundredths percent (0.04%) or greater.
A driver violating these rules may not return to work until evaluated and released by a
substance abuse professional and subsequently tested for alcohol and drugs with
negative results.
A driver tested with an alcohol concentration greater than two-hundredths percent
(0.02%) and less than four-hundredths percent (0.04%) may not drive or perform other
safety sensitive functions for twenty-four (24) hours after the test.
Federal civil penalties for breach of the Federal rules range between one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each offense. Federal

does not directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote.
Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting shall close only an existing portion of the
meeting facility necessary to house the members of the public governmental body in the closed

public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall
be stated in the minutes.
Section 130.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
Section 130.090. Custodian Designated — Response To
Request For Access To Records.
The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible for maintenance and

industry regulators having similar authority.

event later than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the request is received

(3) days for reasonable cause.
If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written statement of
the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which
access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third (3rd)

Section 130.100. Violations — Remedies, Procedure, Penalty —
Validity of Actions By Governing Bodies in Violation —
Governmental Bodies May Seek Interpretation of Law.
The remedies provided by this Section against public governmental bodies shall be in addition to
those provided by any other provision of law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to, or citizen of, this
State, may seek judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the
County in which the public governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of
a summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil action brought to enforce the
provisions of Sections 610.010 to 610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the
subject matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or otherwise dispose of
the public record sought to be inspected and examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an
exemption pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record is not a
public record until the court directs otherwise.
Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., demonstrates
to the court that the body in question is subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., and has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion shall be
on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds that there is a knowing violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all costs
and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing a violation. The court shall
determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds that there was a purposeful violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing such a violation. The
court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction,
the seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body has violated
any provision of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in

violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts of the particular
case that the public interest in the enforcement of the policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., outweighs the public interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed
meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within one (1) year from which the
violation is ascertainable and in no event shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the
violation. This Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of bonds or
other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body if a public hearing, election or
public sale has been held regarding the bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of closing a particular meeting,
record or vote may bring suit at the expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court
of the County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to ascertain the
propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of the attorney general or an attorney for the
governmental body.
Section 130.110. Fees For Copying Public Records —
Limitations.
Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body shall provide access to and,
upon request, furnish copies of public records subject to the following:
Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,
RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the average hourly
rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time required for
fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the
scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies using employees
of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the records
may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14) inches shall
include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of
pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and programming, if
necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for the duplication. Fees for
maps, blueprints or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual
rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps, blueprints or
plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the actual cost of such
programming.
Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of copies.

[Ord. No. 7240 § 1, 12-16-2005; Ord. No. 8302 § 1, 3-13-2017]
Definitions.
"Pit bull" means any pit bull that is an American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier,
Staffordshire Bull Terrier, or any pit bull displaying the physical traits of any one (1) or more of
the above breeds, or any pit bull exhibiting those distinguishing characteristics that conform to
the standards established by the American Kennel Club ("AKC") or United Kennel Club

pit bull, then the owner, keeper or harborer of the dog may make an appointment with the
Director of Public Works and Health for the purpose of the Director making a determination as
to whether or not such dog is a pit bull. If the pit bull owner, keeper or harborer wishes to
appeal the determination that the dog is a pit bull, then within five (5) business days of the
Director's determination such owner, keeper or harborer may request a hearing before the
Director. The hearing shall be held no more than thirty (30) days after the Director receives
the request. The hearing may be informal and the rules of evidence not strictly observed. The
decision of the Director is final.

should have known, was a pit bull that has not been spayed or neutered unless:
The pit bull is under eight (8) weeks of age;
The pit bull cannot be spayed or neutered without a high likelihood of suffering serious
bodily harm or death due to a physical abnormality. A veterinarian must certify such a
condition and determine the time frame after which the pit bull can be spayed or
neutered. Within thirty (30) days of the operative date of this ordinance, or within thirty
(30) days of taking possession or ownership of an unspayed or unneutered pit bull, the
owner, keeper or harborer must submit such documentation to be verified by the Director

Penalties For Failure To Spay Or Neuter. Any person who violates the provisions of this Section
requiring that a pit bull be spayed or neutered shall be subject to the following:
A first violation shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) and
the impoundment of the pit bull by the Director of Public Works and Health. In order for the
owner, keeper or harborer to reclaim the pit bull from the Director, in addition to paying the
other charges and fees set out in this Chapter, one (1) of the following must occur:
The Director of Public Works and Health shall have a veterinarian spay or neuter the pit
bull. The pit bull owner, keeper or harborer shall pay a deposit of one hundred dollars
($100.00) prior to the procedure and will be charged the fee for such services consisting
of the actual expense incurred as established by the Director.
In the alternative, the owner, keeper or harborer shall arrange for another veterinarian
within the City to spay or neuter and shall pay the Director of Public Works and Health a
fee of sixty dollars ($60.00), which shall cover the Director's costs of delivering the pit bull
to a veterinarian of the owners, keeper's or harborers choosing. The Director shall deliver
the pit bull to the veterinarian, and the veterinarian shall release the pit bull to the owner,
keeper or harborer only after the spaying or neutering is complete.
At the discretion of the Director of Public Works and Health, the Director may release the
pit bull to the owner, keeper or harborer provided that the owner, keeper or harborer
signs an affidavit swearing or affirming that such owner, keeper or harborer will have the
pit bull spayed or neutered within two (2) weeks and will provide documentation verifying
that the spaying or neutering occurred upon completion. If the owner, keeper or harborer
fails to have his or her pit bull spayed or neutered as agreed in the affidavit, the Director
shall have the authority to impound the dog, and the owner, keeper or harborer may be
charged with a second violation of this Section.
In the event that the Director of Public Works and Health determines that payment of any
fees by the owner, keeper or harborer of a pit bull which is impounded or otherwise taken
into custody would cause extreme financial difficulty to the owner, keeper or harborer,
then the Director may, at his or her discretion, waive all or part of the fees necessary for
compliance with this Section.
A second violation of this Section by the owner, keeper or harborer, shall be punishable by
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six (6) months or by a fine not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by both such fine and imprisonment. In addition, a second
violation shall result in the Director of Public Works and Health impounding the pit bull and
disposing of the pit bull in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
Permit For The Breeding And Transfer Of Pit Bull Offspring.
No person shall cause or allow any pit bull to breed or give birth without first obtaining a
permit as described in this Section.
Keeping an unaltered male adult pit bull together with a female pit bull in heat in the same pit
bull run, pen, room, or any other space where the two (2) dogs are allowed contact with one
another that would allow the pit bulls to breed is considered prima facie evidence of an owner,
keeper or harborer's intent to allow the pit bulls to breed.
If a female pit bull is impounded pursuant to this Section and the pit bull is pregnant or has
offspring under eight (8) weeks of age and such pit bull is owned, kept or harbored by a
person who has caused or allowed the pit bull to breed or give birth without first obtaining a
permit as described in this Section, then a disposition of the unborn issue or offspring shall be
made by the Director of Public Works and Health.

Requirements Of Permit. An owner or keeper of a pit bull may annually obtain a nontransferable
permit. If more than one (1) owner, keeper or harborer is involved in the breeding
process, each party must apply for and be granted a breeding permit. The permit may be
obtained from the Director of Public Works and Health if all of the following conditions are
met:
The applicant has submitted the appropriate forms and fees required by the Director of
Public Works and Health in order to seek consideration for a breeding permit.
The applicant has a space in which to breed pit bulls and raise the offspring that the
Director of Public Works and Health is satisfied will contain the animals as well as
provide them with safe, sanitary, and humane conditions, appropriate for breeding pit
bulls, which satisfies all applicable provisions of this Chapter.
The Director of Public Works and Health has evaluated and reached a positive
conclusion regarding the suitability of the particular pit bulls to be bred, including
consideration of their lineage, age and health condition. The Director of Public Works and
Health shall utilize the following guidelines in making a determination:
The owner, keeper or guardian shall provide verification that any pit bull to be bred is
registered as an American Pit bull Terrier, an American Staffordshire Terrier, or a
Staffordshire Bull Terrier, with the appropriate registry for its breed (American Kennel
Club, United Kennel Club, American Dog Breeders Association ("ADBA")) or any
other valid registry as determined by the Director of Public Works and Health.
Any pit bull to be bred must meet the pit bull breed standard, as defined by the
appropriate registration agency (AK, UKC, or ADBA), for physical conformation as
well as temperament.
The registered pit bull has participated in at least one (1) approved pit bull show
during the previous three-hundred-sixty-five-day period. A pit bull show is defined as
an event that is sanctioned in writing by one (1) or more of the pit bull registries listed
above.
Any pit bull to be bred shall have the appropriate health screenings for its breed. For
pit bulls this is, at a minimum, the following health tests: Orthopedic Foundation for
Animals ("OFA") or University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program
("PennHIP") certification on hips, OFA on heart by a certified cardiologist and must
have passed the American Temperament Testing Society temperament test.

Upon approval of an application, the applicant must pay the one hundred dollars
($100.00) permit fee.
Permit Denial. The Director of Public Works and Health shall automatically deny the permit if
one (1) or more of the following occurs and the Director's decision shall be final:
The applicant fails to pay the permit fee within two (2) weeks of notification that the
application has been approved. The applicant may reapply for a permit after ten (10)
months.
The applicant has a history of allowing dogs to run loose or escape, has otherwise been
found to be neglectful, has a pit bull identified as a nuisance, or has previously been
determined to have violated provisions of this Chapter.
The applicant has applied for a permit within the last ten (10) months.

cannot be contacted for an inspection within two (2) weeks of the Director's initial attempt
or the owner, keeper or harborer fails or refuses to allow an inspection, then the Director
of Public Works and Health shall not issue a permit.
Revoking A Permit.
The Director of Public Works and Health may, after conducting a hearing, revoke a breeding
permit for a violation of the provisions of this Section. Within five (5) days of the Director's
knowledge of any such violation, a hearing officer designated by the Director shall give notice
to the owner, keeper or harborer of the pit bull in writing that such owner, keeper or harborer
is in violation of this Section and is subject to the revocation of his or her breeding permit.
Unless the hearing is waived by the owner, keeper or harborer of the pit bull, or the hearing is
scheduled on an agreed-upon date, the hearing officer shall fix a time not less than ten (10) or
more than thirty (30) days from the date of the violation notice. The hearing officer shall fix a
place for said hearing and cause all parties to be notified, not less than five (5) days before

actual attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense
could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to
be.
Section 210.030. Conspiracy.
Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense when a person, with
the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, agrees with another person
or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.
No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense if,
after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).

he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.

Good Faith Immunity for Law Enforcement Officials.
When a Law Enforcement Officer has probable cause to believe a party has committed a violation
of law amounting to domestic violence, as defined in Section 455.010, RSMo., against a family or
household member, the officer may arrest the offending party whether or not the violation occurred

Subsection, the Officer shall make a written report of the incident completely describing the
offending party, giving the victim's name, time, address, reason why no arrest was made and any
other pertinent information. Any Law Enforcement Officer subsequently called to the same
address within a twelve-hour period, who shall find probable cause to believe the same offender
has again committed a violation as stated in this Subsection against the same or any other family
or household member, shall arrest the offending party for this subsequent offense. The primary
report of non-arrest in the preceding twelve-hour period may be considered as evidence of the
defendant's intent in the violation for which arrest occurred. The refusal of the victim to sign an
official complaint against the violator shall not prevent an arrest under this Subsection.

When an Officer makes an arrest, the officer is not required to arrest two (2) parties involved in an
assault when both parties claim to have been assaulted. The arresting Officer shall attempt to
identify and shall arrest the party the Officer believes is the primary physical aggressor. The term
"primary physical aggressor" is defined as the most significant, rather than the first, aggressor.
The Law Enforcement Officer shall consider any or all of the following in determining the
primary physical aggressor:
The intent of the law to protect victims from continuing domestic violence;
The comparative extent of injuries inflicted or serious threats creating fear of physical
injury;
The history of domestic violence between the persons involved.
No Law Enforcement Officer investigating an incident of domestic violence shall threaten the
arrest of all parties for the purpose of discouraging requests or law enforcement intervention
by any party. Where complaints are received from two (2) or more opposing parties, the
Officer shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine whether the Officer should seek
a warrant for an arrest.
In an arrest in which a Law Enforcement Officer acted in good faith reliance on this Section, the
arresting and assisting Law Enforcement Officers and their employing entities and superiors shall
be immune from liability in any civil action alleging false arrest, false imprisonment or malicious
prosecution.

notice, shall be a Class A misdemeanor unless the respondent has previously pleaded guilty to or
has been found guilty in any Division of the Circuit Court of violating an ex parte order of
protection or a full order of protection within five (5) years of the date of the subsequent violation,
in which case the subsequent violation shall be a Class E felony. Evidence of prior pleas of guilty
or findings of guilt shall be heard by the Court out of the presence of the jury prior to submission of
the case to the jury. If the Court finds the existence of such prior pleas of guilty or finding of guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court shall decide the extent or duration of sentence or other
disposition and shall not instruct the jury as to the range of punishment or allow the jury to assess
and declare the punishment as a part of its verdict.

coercion if the property sought to be obtained by virtue of such threat was honestly
claimed as restitution or indemnification for harm done in the circumstances to which
the accusation, exposure, lawsuit or other official action relates or as compensation for
property or lawful service. The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of
justification as to any threat.

Making a representation which is false and which the actor does not believe to be true and upon
which the victim relies, as to a matter of fact, law, value, intention or other state of mind or
concealing a material fact as to the terms of a contract or agreement. The term "deceit" does not,
however, include falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or puffing by statements
unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed. Deception as to the actor's intention
to perform a promise shall not be inferred from the fact alone that he/she did not subsequently

lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to him or her by the owner of such

in its existing condition, or to deprive, temporarily, the owner or possessor of that thing.

A person commits the offense of stealing leased or rented property if, with the intent to deprive the

Purposefully fails to return leased or rented personal property to the place and within the time
specified in an agreement in writing providing for the leasing or renting of such personal
property;
Conceals or aids or abets the concealment of the property from the owner;
Sells, encumbers, conveys, pawns, loans, abandons or gives away the leased or rented
property or any part thereof, without the written consent of the lessor, or without informing the
person to whom the property is transferred to, that the property is subject to a lease;
Returns the property to the lessor at the end of the lease term, plus any agreed upon
extensions, but does not pay the lease charges agreed upon in the written instrument, with
the intent to wrongfully deprive the lessor of the agreed upon charges.
The provisions of this Section shall apply to all forms of leasing and rental agreements including,
but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options to buy the leased or rented
personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts. For the purpose of
determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing contracts which provide options to
buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to the lessee.
Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay
the lease charges to the lessor within seven (7) days after written demand for the return has been
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address the person set forth in the lease
agreement, or in the absence of the address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall
be evidence of intent to violate the provisions of this Section, except that if a motor vehicle has not
been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement,
such failure to return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of
stealing leased or rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the
motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease
or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the
lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor
vehicle to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor
vehicles. Any Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor
vehicle and notify the lessor that he/she may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed
and its vehicle identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or
rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the seven-day
period prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the
property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five
(5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this
Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.

abatement shall be certified to the administration and finance manager who shall upon
approval transmit the certification to the Collector of Revenue for inclusion of the certified

exists which affects public health or safety, he shall order abatement of the violation
under such conditions and within such time period as is deeded appropriate under the

thing done on the premises by the landlord during the existence of the tenancy of lease, the landlord is
the person responsible. Any person who has caused to exist on any premises of which he/she is not
the owner, landlord, occupant or tenant any collection of water in which mosquitoes breed or are likely
to breed is responsible as well as the owner, landlord or occupant, as the case may be.

When the right-half of a roadway is closed to traffic while under construction or repair; or
Upon a roadway designated by local ordinance as a one-way street and marked or signed for
one-way traffic.
It is unlawful to drive any vehicle upon any highway or road which has been divided into two (2) or
more roadways by means of a physical barrier or by means of a dividing section or delineated by

An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen

caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.
Section 340.260. No Passing Zones.

The Section of roadway involved shall be held a no-passing zone, and the Director of Public
Works shall immediately mark such no-passing zone by painting a solid yellow line on the
roadway surface just to the right of the centerline of such roadway. Thereafter, the Director of
Public Works shall, by appropriate signs, indicate the beginning and end of the no-passing zone.

of a vehicle who shall fail to comply with the directions thereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
The Director of Public Works shall keep a record of all such zones and the location thereof, and
such records shall be public records and subject to public inspection.
In any prosecution for the violation of such no-passing zones as herein provided, proof that the
roadway was marked with a solid yellow line or signs posted at the beginning and end of such
zones as herein provided shall constitute a prima facie presumption that such no-passing zone
was duly, properly and lawfully marked and designated as herein provided.
Section 340.270. Passing Regulations.
The following rules shall govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles proceeding in the same
direction, subject to the limitations and exceptions hereinafter stated:
The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass
to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway
until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle; and
Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken
vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle and shall not increase the
speed of such driver's vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.
The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass to the right of another vehicle only under the
following conditions:
When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
Upon a City street with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for two (2) or more lines of
vehicles in each direction; or
Upon a one-way street.
The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right
only under the foregoing conditions when such movement may be made in safety. In no
event shall such movement be made by driving off the paved or main traveled portion of
the roadway. The provisions of this Subsection shall not relieve the driver of a slowmoving
vehicle from the duty to drive as closely as practicable to the right-hand edge of
the roadway.
Except when a roadway has been divided into three (3) traffic lanes, no vehicle shall be driven to
the left side of the centerline of a highway or public road in overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming
traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made

view is obstructed within such distance as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle
might approach from the opposite direction.
When the view is obstructed upon approaching within one hundred (100) feet of any bridge,
viaduct, tunnel or when approaching within one hundred (100) feet of or at any intersection or

Section 340.280. Stopping For School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers

violations of county or municipal ordinances or in any license suspension or revocation proceeding
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 302, RSMo., arising out of acts alleged to have been
committed by any person while driving a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition, the
amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the time of the act alleged as shown by any chemical
analysis of the person's blood, breath, saliva or urine is admissible in evidence and the provisions
of Subdivision (5) of Section 491.060, RSMo., shall not prevent the admissibility or introduction of
such evidence if otherwise admissible. If there was eight-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or
more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, this shall be prima facie evidence that the person

Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per one hundred
(100) milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath.

presumption or to have the effect provided for in Subsection (A) of this Section, shall have been
performed as provided in Sections 577.020 to 577.041, RSMo., and in accordance with methods

dismissed with prejudice if a chemical analysis of the defendant's breath, blood, saliva, or urine
performed in accordance with Sections 577.020 to 577.041, RSMo., and rules promulgated
thereunder by the State Department of Health and Senior Services demonstrate that there was
less than eight-hundredths of one percent (.08%) of alcohol in the defendant's blood unless one
(1) or more of the following considerations cause the court to find a dismissal unwarranted:
There is evidence that the chemical analysis is unreliable as evidence of the defendant's
intoxication at the time of the alleged violation due to the lapse of time between the alleged
violation and the obtaining of the specimen;
There is evidence that the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance, or
drug, or a combination of either or both with or without alcohol; or
There is substantial evidence of intoxication from physical observations of witnesses or

operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon the streets
or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this Subsection if

stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1)
person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
An insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective
dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit according to Section 303.240,
RSMo.
A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.
Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the insured motor vehicle or by the
operator of the motor vehicle if the proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator
rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or

Penalty — Confiscation of False Evidence.

liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.
No person shall alter an invalid insurance card to make it appear valid. No person knowingly shall

The Building Commissioner finds the proposed fence would be detrimental to the stability
and values of surrounding property by reason of its incompatibility and inappropriateness
thereto and is inharmonious and inconsistent with the surrounding property and
detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City.
The Building Commissioner's office shall make an inspection after the fence is erected to
determine that all code requirements have been met.
In the event that the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission is required, the
Building Commissioner shall upon receipt of a processing fee from the applicant, no more
than seven (7) days after filing of the application for a fence permit, certify the application

information in his/her possession to the City of Florissant Planning and Zoning Commission.
Within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Planning and Zoning Commission, in writing, will deliver
to the Building Commissioner its approval, conditional approval, rejection or disapproval of the
said application. Failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to act within said thirty (30)
day period shall constitute an approval of said application.
Following the certification of such application and attached documents, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall consider the same at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the
applicant has been given written notice as to the time and place of the meeting and at which
meeting the applicant shall be accorded an opportunity to be heard regarding the application
as filed.

of blight in the City of Florissant.
If the finding of the Planning and Zoning Commission is adverse to the applicant and no
permit is issued by the Building Commissioner, the applicant may appeal to the Board of
Adjustment.

In order to protect the property rights and values, public health, safety, morals and general
welfare of all citizens within the City of Florissant, fences must be kept in good repair and if of
a type other than chain link or similar non-rusting material, properly painted or preserved. The
owner shall repair, paint, remove or otherwise attend to any fence if it becomes unsightly or a
menace to public safety, health or welfare. The Building Commissioner is hereby empowered
to issue notices to property owners to comply with this Section. Owners will be given a
reasonable time to comply with this Section but not to exceed forty-five (45) days except that

compliance would work an undue hardship.
The Building Commissioner shall issue no permit for the erection, alteration or enlargement of
a fence without the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission of the City of Florissant
if:
Same is novel in design and not in use in the City; or
The Building Commissioner finds the proposed fence would be detrimental to the stability
and values of surrounding property by reason of its incompatibility and inappropriateness
thereto and is inharmonious and inconsistent with the surrounding property and
detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City.
The Building Commissioner's office shall make an inspection after the fence is erected to
determine that all code requirements have been met.
In the event that the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission is required, the

information in his/her possession to the City of Florissant Planning and Zoning Commission.
Within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Planning and Zoning Commission, in writing, will deliver
to the Building Commissioner its approval, conditional approval, rejection or disapproval of the
said application. Failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to act within said thirty (30)
day period shall constitute an approval of said application.
Following the certification of such application and attached documents, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall consider the same at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the
applicant has been given written notice as to the time and place of the meeting and at which
meeting the applicant shall be accorded an opportunity to be heard regarding the application
as filed.

Interpretation of the chart.
The loading space requirements apply to all of the uses indicated in the chart and to this
District.
The loading requirements in this Section do not limit special requirements which may be
imposed in connection with Special Uses.
Mixed uses in one (1) building. Where a building is used for more than one (1) use or for
different uses and where the floor area used for each use for which loading space is required
is below the minimum for required loading spaces, but the aggregate floor area used is
greater than such minimum, then off-street loading space shall be provided as if the entire
building were used for that use in the building for which the most spaces are required.
Special Conditions. The following conditions apply:
Except as otherwise prohibited hereunder, a "B-5" Planned Commercial District may be
established on any tract of land in accordance with provisions of this Section.
A "B-5" Planned Commercial District may be established by ordinance of the City Council in
the same manner that other mapped Districts are established where the City Council
determines that any particular tracts or areas should be developed for commercial use, but
because of possible conflicts with adjoining uses, more development control is necessary to
protect the general welfare than is possible under the regulations of the other "B" Commercial
Districts.
A "B-5" Planned Commercial District shall not be established on any tract of land less than
one (1) acre that has a common property line with an "R" Residential District and does not
have a common property line with any "B-5" Commercial or "M" Industrial District unless
recommended to be rezoned to a Commercial District by the City's Comprehensive Plan,
dated revised November 30, 2004.

No less than three (3) acres of common land shall be set aside in any residential
subdivision. The location, extent and purpose of common land proposed to be set aside
for open space or recreation use within any subdivision must be reviewed and approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission before the provisions of Subsection (4)(b)
above shall apply. A private recreation use such as a golf course or swimming pool
whose use is reserved for owners or occupants of lots located within the development
may be approved as common land. Other uses or activities which may qualify as
common land include historic buildings or sites, parkway areas and ornamental parks.
Low land along streams or areas of rough terrain may also be included when such areas
are extensive, continuous and have natural features worth preserving.

by trust agreement or other applicable legal documentation as required by the ordinance
regulating the subdivision of land. Such common land shall be set aside by deed
restriction for a minimum of twenty (20) years.
All of the above exceptions shall be subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning
Commission exercised through their review of preliminary and final subdivision plats. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the topography, tree cover and other
natural features of the site as well as the standards of this Chapter, the Subdivision
Ordinance and recognized principles of landscape architecture, land use planning and
civic design in administering these exceptions.

It shall be unlawful to erect any fence in the City of Florissant without first having filed with the
Building Commissioner an application for a fence permit together with a sketch or diagram of
the type of fencing, design and color and its location and having obtained a permit for its
erection. There will be a fee for such permit and said fees shall apply to replacement fences.
Fencing of lots in Zoning Districts "A", "R-1", "R-2", "R-3", "R-4", "R-5" and "R-6" shall be
permitted only under the following conditions. Upon approval of the Building Commissioner a
fence may be located on or within the lot lines in rear yards and side yards of all lots other
than corner lots to a height not exceeding six (6) feet. No fence may be located within any
part of the required front yard except with Planning and Zoning Commission review and
approval with respect to public safety and design and that said fence may be erected on a lot
line separating residential property from commercial property in the front yard where the front
yard is adjacent to commercial property.
On corner lots no fence may be located in front of the building line along the street side of
such lot. A fence, not exceeding six (6) feet in height, may be located within the side yard
along the side of such lot not abutting the street and may be located within that portion of the
rear yard behind the building line along the street side of such lot.
In all other Districts as defined in this Chapter as "B-1", "B-2", "B-3", "B-4", "M-1" or "M-2", any
fencing may be allowed but only as directed and approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission after giving due consideration for the public safety, health and welfare and
architectural designs of the City. In no case shall fencing extend beyond the front building line
within these Zoning Districts.
Open mesh-type fences higher than six (6) feet may enclose public parks, recreational and
school areas, but only as directed and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission
after giving due consideration for the public safety, health, welfare and architectural designs of
the City.
All fences shall be constructed with the structural or supporting members located within or
toward the area to be enclosed or in such a manner as to present the least conspicuous view
of these members to the public. Fences constructed of light gauge wire such as chicken coop
wire, barbed wire, snow fences, bamboo or other flimsy material are forbidden. No solid-type
plywood or similar type wood fence or wall will be allowed in Zoning Districts "A", "R-1", "R-2",
"R-3", "R-4" and "R-6".
In order to protect the property rights and values, public health, safety, morals and general
welfare of all citizens within the City of Florissant, fences must be kept in good repair and if of
a type other than chain link or similar non-rusting material, properly painted or preserved. The
owner shall repair, paint, remove or otherwise attend to any fence if it becomes unsightly or a
menace to public safety, health or welfare. The Building Commissioner is hereby empowered
to issue notices to property owners to comply with this Section. Owners will be given a
reasonable time to comply with this Section but not to exceed forty-five (45) days except that
a longer period may be given at the discretion of the Building Commissioner if such
compliance would work an undue hardship.
The Building Commissioner shall issue no permit for the erection, alteration or enlargement of
a fence without the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission of the City of Florissant
if:
Same is novel in design and not in use in the City; or
The Building Commissioner finds the proposed fence would be detrimental to the stability
and values of surrounding property by reason of its incompatibility and inappropriateness
thereto and is inharmonious and inconsistent with the surrounding property and
detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City.

The Building Commissioner shall make an inspection after the fence is erected to
determine that all code requirements have been met.
In the event that the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission is required, the
Building Commissioner shall upon receipt of the applicable processing fee from the applicant
no more than seven (7) days after filing of the application for a fence permit, certify the
application together with attached sketches or diagrams, specifications and other pertinent
instruments or information to the City of Florissant Planning and Zoning Commission. Within
thirty (30) days thereafter, the Planning and Zoning Commission, in writing, will deliver to the
Building Commissioner its approval, conditional approval, rejection or disapproval of the said
application. Failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to act within said thirty (30) day
period shall constitute an approval of said application.
Following the certification of such application and attached documents at least two (2) weeks
prior to its next meeting, the Commission shall consider the same at its next regularly
scheduled meeting after the applicant has been given written notice as to the time and place
of the meeting and at which meeting the applicant shall be accorded an opportunity to be
heard regarding the application as filed.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall approve or conditionally approve the application if
it finds:
The subject matter of the application would not be detrimental to or inconsistent with
property in the surrounding area based on the following conditions:
Overall design.
Color of materials.
Combination of materials.
Texture of materials.
Height.
Relation of fence to other improvements or structures on adjoining properties and
streets.
Said finding of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not in any case be based on
personal preference as to taste, choice or architectural style but be based upon
consideration of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare and the elimination
of blight in the City of Florissant.
If the finding of the Planning and Zoning Commission is adverse to the applicant and no
permit is issued by the Building Commissioner, the applicant may appeal to the Board of
Adjustment.

in the "HB" Historic Business District, parking lots shall have no more than two (2) curb cuts
for entrances and exits on any single street block. No driveway or curb cut shall be less than
twenty-five (25) feet in width.
Except as permitted in the "HB" Historic Business District or otherwise authorized by
ordinance or existing as a non-conforming parking lot, entrances or exits for all parking
facilities with ten (10) or more spaces shall not be located within fifty (50) feet of the
intersection of curblines at a street intersection.
In "B-5" Planned Commercial Districts, parking spaces and drive aisles shall adhere to the
minimum setbacks of the underlying zoning district.
To the maximum extent practicable, minimum off-street parking and loading requirements as
specified in this Section shall not include parking and loading spaces located in the 100-year
floodplain. Where parking or loading spaces are necessary within the floodplain they shall
conform to the City's Flood Damage Prevention and Control Ordinance.[1]
Editor's Note: See Ch. 415, Flood Damage Prevention and Control.
No off-street parking space required under this Section shall be used for any other purpose.
Where a change in use creates greater parking requirements than the amount being
provided, an occupancy permit shall not be issued until provision is made for the increased
amount of required off-street parking.
Where an addition is made to an existing use which does not comply with the parking
requirements cited for such use, the proposed development shall conform to the provisions of
this Section.
When one or more of the parking requirements may be construed as applicable to the same
use, lot or building, the required parking will be the greater parking requirement.
Green space and screening requirements. Landscaping shall be required in accordance with
the City's Landscaping and Screening Regulations Ordinance, Section 405.245.
Based upon site conditions and appropriate documentation, the Building Commissioner may
authorize up to ten percent (10%) of the required parking spaces to be satisfied by providing
bicycle parking spaces in lieu of vehicular parking spaces.
All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same parcel of land as the use to
be served except as follows:
Parking for one (1) or more uses in a commercial or industrial district may be provided on
a separate lot when said separate lot is within a similar zoning district type and within
three hundred (300) feet of the use or uses to be served, as measured along a
pedestrian walkway designed to allow pedestrians to safely access the use.
When two (2) or more owners agree to provide their required parking spaces jointly, the
number of joint parking spaces shall be equal to the number of parking spaces required if
each were to provide parking separately, unless otherwise stated herein.
The applicants for joint parking shall submit a joint parking plan and an appropriate
legal instrument of agreement among the involved property owners for review by the
Building Commissioner and approval by the City Attorney.
Such joint parking plan and agreement shall include language binding the owners of
the properties and their successors and assigns to the agreement and limiting and
controlling use of land to those uses and conditions approved by the City.

Except as otherwise authorized, parking areas shall be used for automobile parking only with
no dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing except emergency repairs or servicing;
and the regulations contained herein shall not be construed to prevent an individual motor
vehicle owner from offering one (1) motor vehicle for sale or from performing maintenance or
repairs upon his/her own motor vehicle while legally parked upon the premises where the
owner resides, so long as such operations do not create a safety hazard or nuisance.
Parking lots and walkways shall be illuminated to provide for the safe use thereof, and lighting
studies shall be provided as needed to provide evidence of adequate lighting to promote
general security.
"HB" Historic Business District.
Except to the extent that the required number of parking spaces may otherwise be
provided as authorized herein, assembly uses commenced after March 1, 2002, in the
"HB" Historic Business District shall be required to meet the parking requirements unless
a cross-parking agreement is established with immediately adjacent properties. However,
such immediate adjacent properties must have a level of use that is less than that of an
assembly use. Such cross-parking shall be subject to review and approval by the
Building Commissioner.
New commercial and institutional buildings in the "HB" Historic Business District shall be
designed such that every effort is made to provide required parking behind the front of
the building. Consistent with good planning practices and taking into account adjoining
properties and access requirements that would be necessary for provision of the required
parking behind the front of the building, the Building Commissioner may waive the
application of this Subsection.
Modifications To These Requirements. An applicant may request a modification of the
requirements set forth herein by providing a parking demand study, as defined below, that
supports the request and demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the requested
modifications are appropriate for the site and do not cause detriment to adjacent properties.
A parking demand study is required when an applicant:
Requests a reduction in the minimum parking requirements;
Requests to exceed the maximum parking requirements;
Requests any other modification to the standards of this Section.
The parking demand study shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:
A plan which graphically depicts where the parking spaces, loading spaces, stacking
area, and parking structures are to be located, as well as the on-site circulation for
automobile, pedestrian, and bicycle movement.
A report which demonstrates how any variations from this Section were calculated and
upon what assumptions such calculations were based; and how everything shown on the
plan complies with, or varies from, applicable standards and procedures of the City.
The plan shall show all entrances and exits for any structured parking and the
relationship between parking lots or structures and the circulation.
The plan, supported by the report, shall show the use, number, location, and typical
dimensions of parking and loading for various vehicle types, including passenger

vehicles, trucks, vehicles for mobility-impaired persons, motorcycles, buses, other transit
vehicles and bicycles.
The plan, supported by the report, shall include phasing plans for the construction of
parking facilities and any interim facilities planned.
Whenever the applicant requests to reduce the number of required parking spaces; or to
exceed the maximum parking provided for in this Section, the required report shall
document how the proposed parking was calculated and upon what assumptions such
calculations were based.
Such other information as determined by the Building Commissioner, Planning and
Zoning Commission or City Council to be necessary or appropriate.
Design features and review criteria, including, but not limited to, those listed below, will be
reviewed when in conjunction with requests for modification to any of the requirements of this
Section.
The parking demand study provides sufficient number and types of spaces to serve the
uses identified on the site.
Adequate provisions are made for the safety of all parking facility users, including
motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians.
Sites are designed to minimize or alleviate traffic problems.
Parking spaces are located near the uses they are intended to serve and shall provide
safe and convenient access for pedestrian access to the facility.
Adequate on-site parking is provided during each phase of development of the district.
The development provides opportunities for shared parking or for other reductions in trip
generation through the adoption of transportation demand management (TDM)
techniques to reduce trip generation, such as car pools, van pools, bicycles, employer
transit subsidies, compressed work hours, and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) parking
preference.
Reductions in the number of parking and loading spaces should be related to significant
factors such as, but not limited to:
Shared parking opportunities between different land use categories or uses with
different hours of operation;
The availability and incorporation of transit services and facilities;
Opportunities for reduced trip generation through pedestrian circulation between
mixed uses;
Off-site traffic mitigation measures;
Recognized variations in standards due to the scale of the facilities;
Parking demand for a specified use;
The provisions of accessible parking spaces beyond those required per the City
Code;
Provision of bicycle parking spaces; and

Opportunities for reduced loading requirements, based on business practices.
Requests for modifications will be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or
the City Council as part of the approval process.
Deferred Parking. An applicant may request phantom parking or deferred parking, which is to
defer the construction of the number of required parking spaces and/or loading spaces until a later
date. Deferred parking means that some of the required parking spaces and/or loading spaces
might not be constructed unless they were deemed to be necessary after full build-out occurs, but
that an area on the site would be reserved so that these spaces could be provided in the future
upon demand or request by the City. Said demand would be made if the spaces were needed to
meet the parking and loading needs of the project.
The Building Commissioner may grant a deferral for construction of up to fifty percent (50%)
of the off-street parking and/or loading spaces required by this Section in an industrial district;
thirty percent (30%) in a commercial district and any other district if an applicant
demonstrates:
Trip generation characteristics and time of day usage characteristics for similar uses
show that the parking spaces can be reduced without causing parking to overlap into
other nearby developments or onto public streets.
Vehicles owned by the occupants are characteristically different from the norm or the
proximity to employment, shopping, educational and transit developments is such that
reduced auto usage would be anticipated.
The immediate proximity to public transportation facilities serves a significant proportion
of residents, employees, and/or customers.
Operation of effective private or company car pool, van pool, bus or similar transportation
programs with proof of continued financial viability.
Evidence that a proportion of residents, employees, and/or customers utilize, have
available or on a regular basis use bicycle or other transportation alternative
commensurate with reduced parking requirements.
Development will be in phases so that deferring the parking will have green space until
further build-out. The site must meet all parking requirements based upon square footage
actually built.
The businesses' delivery requirements for operations and delivery vehicles utilized
require less loading space than the minimum required.
Applicants for deferral of parking shall provide a written statement which addresses how the
proposal meets the applicable criteria. The application shall include a site plan depicting the
total required parking and loading on site, and the deferred parking and loading area(s) shall
be labeled as reserved for future parking.
The land area delineated for deferred parking shall be shown on the plan with proposed finish
grades and landscaping. Landscaping for the deferred parking area shall be as approved by
the Building Commissioner with the remainder of the site landscaped per guidelines for the
appropriate district. All landscaping shall be indicated on the plan submitted.
The owner of the property, or his or her designated party, shall notify the City of any change in
the conditions that were the basis for a deferral.
The City may require the construction of parking and/or loading in areas previously reserved
at any time upon sixty (60) days' written notice. A parking deferral shall apply to the developer

the City, or its designated representative, authority to enter onto its property in the future to
construct the deferred parking in the areas shown on the approved site plan if owners fail to
take action sixty (60) days after receiving written notice by the City. The costs incurred by the
City shall be repaid by the owners or shall be placed as a special lien against the property.
Development and construction by the City shall not be in lieu of a municipal zoning ordinance
violation, but shall be in addition to any action taken for violation of provisions of this Section.

All antennae support structures shall be surrounded by a landscape strip of not less than
ten (10) feet in width, with such plantings prescribed in the Special Use Permit. Said
landscape strip may also contain security lighting as may be prescribed by the Special
Use Permit. It shall be exterior to any security fencing. In lieu of the required landscape
strip, a minimum six (6) foot high decorative fence or wall may be approved if such fence
or wall is approved as an alternative means of screening by the Special Use Permit. On
guyed towers, guy anchors shall also be fenced. The tower owner shall display on the
site the reference to its FCC tower site number.
All antennae support structures shall be set back from any dedicated public street and
any adjacent residentially zoned property a distance equal to the height of the tower,
unless otherwise modified by a Special Use Permit approved by the City Council. All
towers adjacent to non-residential zoned property shall maintain setbacks from such nonresidential
zoned property as follows, unless otherwise modified by a Special Use Permit
approved by the City Council: guyed towers shall be set back a distance equal to sixty
percent (60%) of the tower height; support towers and monopoles shall be set back at

Shared use.
In order to maximize the use of an existing or proposed wireless tower, the tower owner
shall, prior to the issuance of any Building Permit or Special Use Permit to alter or modify
any tower existing as of July 13, 1998, provide to the City a written statement signed by a
corporate officer agreeing to make said tower available for use by others subject to
reasonable technical limitations and reasonable financial terms. The willful and knowing
failure of a tower owner to agree to shared use or to negotiate in good faith with potential
users shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same tower owner to
install, build or modify antennae or antennae support structures within the City and
possible forfeiture of continued use of the existing tower.
Prior to the issuance of any Permit to install, build or modify any tower, the tower owner
shall furnish the Building Commissioner an inventory of all towers in or within one-half
(½) mile of the City limits of Florissant and shall certify to the Building Commissioner that
they have not been able to conclude a sharing agreement to use one (1) of the existing
towers or that an existing tower will not meet the technical needs or coverage required by
the applicant. Copies of all rejection letters and of engineering studies indicating the
technical reasons that an existing structure is not acceptable shall be included with the
application.
Any new tower at a height of eighty (80) feet above ground level or higher shall be
designed and constructed to accommodate at least two (2) additional user(s) unless a
larger number is indicated by the City. The willful and knowing failure of the owner of a
tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be cause for
the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install, build or modify antennae or
antennae support structures within the City.
These general requirements shall be observed unless otherwise waived or modified by a
Special Use Permit.

or self-supporting (lattice) tower may be replaced by a monopole or disguised support
structure. The height of the new antennae support structure may exceed that of the original by
not more than twenty (20) feet.
An antennae support structure if located on property owned by the City of Florissant and
leased by the City to the applicant or used by the City following approval of the City Council.
The construction of a disguised support structure in the "A" Recreational District, all "H"
Historic Districts and all residential Districts provided that all related equipment shall be
placed underground or concealed within the structure. In addition, the construction of a
disguised support structure in all commercial districts, industrial districts and the "NU" Non-
Urban District provided that all related equipment shall be placed underground or concealed
within the structure or placed in a cabinet if the disguised support structure is accessory to an
existing commercial, industrial, institutional or other non-residential use. In the event that any
support structure is of a design or type such that there is a question of whether such design or
type is effective to camouflage or conceal its presence as an appropriately placed architecture
or natural feature, the Building Commissioner may disapprove such support structure.
The installation of antennae on buildings or structures or the construction of an antennae
support structure on land owned by a Federal or State agency, Federal or State board or

Planting areas shall be provided at the ratio of one hundred eighty (180) square feet per
fifteen (15) parking spaces with each planting area being a minimum of one hundred eighty
(180) square feet. Planting areas shall be placed within the parking area so as to divide the
paving area into smaller areas.
Trees shall be spaced no greater than fifty (50) feet on center across all front yards. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may approve longer distances between trees due to an
irregularly shaped lot or small lot, in which case clustering of trees may be permitted.
Building plantings shall be planted and maintained along all exterior walls of all buildings at
the ratio of one (1) plant material for every five (5) lineal feet of exterior wall. Said plant
material may be clustered or otherwise arranged for optimum visual effect rather than being
spaced evenly along the building perimeter. Said plantings are not required to be immediately
against the building but, however, shall be adjacent to the building between the building and
parking areas, driveways and similar adjacent areas.
A minimum fifteen (15) foot landscaped buffer (transition yard) and/or sightproof fence or
landscaped berms shall be provided and maintained along all rear and side property lines
which abut an "R" Residential District.
The buffer area shall contain evergreen plant material with a minimum height of six (6)
feet when planted on ten (10) foot centers.
All fences, except those associated with institutional uses, shall be solid reinforced vinyl
or masonry material limited to a maximum height of six (6) feet, and shall not extend
beyond the front building line of the subject property. The fence may be located on the
side and rear property lines, but if the fence is located on a utility easement and
maintenance of utility lines are required in that area, then the property owner is
responsible for replacement of the fence if removed.
The minimum area to be devoted to green open space and landscaping shall be equal to a
percentage of the gross area of the site as follows:
Gross Area Green Space and Landscaping
1 to 1.999 acres 30%
2 to 3.999 acres 25%
4 acres and larger 20%
Each site, one (1) acre or more in size upon development, shall have installed an automatic,
permanent irrigation system designed to cover all landscaped areas. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may require an automatic irrigation system on sites smaller than one (1)
acre if deemed necessary.

landscaping to conceal the visibility of the object from the right-of-way and from neighboring
residentially zoned property. The Planning and Zoning Commission may waive the screening
requirements for electric equipment, telephone equipment and gas meters if such screening
due to configuration and layout of the building would violate the utility clearance requirements
for these items. For the purpose of this Section a "trash container" is any container that is
over ninety-five (95) gallons in size and which is not used for public use. However, property
that has existing grease containers or trash containers that are over ninety-five (95) gallons in
size and is not used for public use on the exterior of the building shall meet the screening
requirements set forth herein by September 1, 2009.
Ord. No. 8323 § 2, 6-12-2017
Screening for outside trash containers shall be of a material that matches or is compatible
with the building.
Rooftop screening shall be made of a material and color that will blend with the building
architecture.
Section 405.250. Exterior Design Regulations.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
The plans for all proposed buildings shall be reviewed against the standards set out below. The
Building Commissioner shall review such plans in the case of an application for one (1) isolated
single-family dwelling or for minor renovations for structures. The plans for all other buildings shall
be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Every dwelling erected within the City of Florissant shall have a minimum ground floor area as
follows:
Single-family dwellings: One thousand one hundred (1,100) square feet.
Two-family dwellings: Seventy hundred fifty (750) square feet.
Multiple-dwellings: Five hundred (500) square feet per unit.
With respect to single-family dwellings and structures, the subject matter of the application, if
erected, would not be detrimental, inharmonious or inconsistent with the property in the
surrounding area. Specific inconsistencies would be:
Varying significant design features such as material, construction of or quality of
architectural design that is of such nature as to be expected to provoke beyond
reasonable doubt an adverse effect on the stability and value of surrounding property and
that the finding is not based on personal preference as to taste or choice of architectural
style.
With respect to the erection, improvement or alteration of commercial, industrial, institutional
or multiple-family dwelling buildings and structures, that same shall be harmonious and
consistent with the property in the surrounding area with respect to the following factors:
Use of space.
Ratio of structure(s) to the building site.
Position of structure(s) and other improvements to adjoining properties and streets.
Position of structures and other improvements on the site.

Article VIII. Special Use Permits
Section 405.300. Intent and Purpose.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
In this Zoning Ordinance, the City has set forth Districts within which the use of land and structures and
the bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized,
however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics and features,
cannot be classified in a particular District or Districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact
of such uses on the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City. Such uses are therefore
treated as Special Uses. A Special Use is not the automatic right of any applicant. The City of
Florissant reserves the full discretion to deny any such application which is detrimental to the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City or areas adjacent to the City.
Section 405.305. Authority.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
The City Council may, by Special Use Permit, after public hearing and notice as provided in this Article
and subject to such protective restrictions that the Council may deem necessary, authorize the
location, extension or structural alteration of any of the buildings or uses under the Special Use
Sections of each Zoning District of the Florissant Zoning Code.

A. The City Council may authorize the transfer of a Special Use Permit granted pursuant to the terms
of this Section under the following procedures:
The applicant for transfer of a Special Use Permit shall file with the City Clerk the application
form identical to the form used to apply for a new Special Use Permit except that the said
form shall be clearly marked as a transfer.
The application shall clearly state that the applicant will operate the business in the same
manner and under the same conditions and terms as were set out in the original ordinance
granting the Special Use Permit or any amendments thereto, except for any proposed change
in sign face of an authorized sign.
The Council shall, by motion duly passed, agree to consider the application for transfer and
shall authorize the petitioner thereby to present the petition for transfer.
At the close of the presentation for transfer the Council, by motion, shall either refer the
matter to the Planning and Zoning Commission for full review or direct that an ordinance be
placed on the next agenda authorizing by ordinance the transfer of the Special Use Permit.
Application for Special Use Permit under the provisions of this Section shall be signed by
applicant and presented to the Building Commissioner in duplicate. Upon receipt of such
request the Building Commissioner shall stamp the date of such receipt upon the original and
duplicate and shall transmit the duplicate copy of said request to the Commission of the City,
which Commission shall make a report to the City Council within thirty (30) days of said date
regarding the effect of such proposed building or use upon the character of the neighborhood,
the traffic conditions, public utility facilities and other matters pertaining to the public safety or
general welfare of the residents of the City of Florissant. No action shall be taken upon any
application for a Special Use Permit to erect a building or for use of land until and unless the
report of the Commission has been filed with the City Clerk. Provided however, that if no
report is received from the Commission within thirty (30) days from receipt of the application
for such permit by the Building Commissioner, then the City Council may proceed with its
action upon the application or such action may be tabled or postponed for an additional period
not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which case the Commission shall be notified of such
postponement.
The City Council shall not grant any Special Use Permit, as provided in this Article, unless a
public hearing shall be held and at least fifteen (15) days' notice of such public hearing shall
have been published in a legal newspaper of general circulation within the City of Florissant
giving the time, place and purpose of such hearing. All public hearings shall be at the request
of the petitioning party, which said request shall be made of the City Clerk within sixty (60)
days of the final action of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Any request for public
hearing not submitted within sixty (60) days of the Planning and Zoning Commission action
shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
If, after a presentation to the Commission, a petition for Special Use Permit is disapproved by
said Commission, said Commission shall not reconsider a presentation concerning the same
tract of land and for the same use within six (6) months following the date of the aforesaid
disapproval, unless all seven (7) members or two-thirds (2/3) of all members of the
Commission, present or otherwise, whichever is the largest number, at a regular meeting
approve such request for reconsideration.
If, after a public hearing by the City Council as herein prescribed, a petition for Special Use
Permit is rejected or disapproved, no public hearing may be granted to consider a petition
concerning the same tract of land and for the same use for six (6) months following the date
of the aforesaid rejection or disapproval unless at least seven (7) members or two-thirds (2/3)
of all members of the City Council, present or otherwise, whichever is the largest number,

A "non-conforming use" is a land or building(s) within the City of Florissant that does not conform to
this Chapter. A non-conforming use may often have a detrimental affect on the land use around it, such
as increased traffic on residential streets, not enough parking spaces, the emission of noxious fumes,
the creation of loud noises or a depressing effect on property values. These regulations are intended to
minimize the existing and/or potential problems created by non-conforming uses.
Section 405.325. Continuance.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
The lawful use of any building, structure or land existing as of February 13, 2006, may be continued,
although such use does not conform with the provisions of this Chapter, under the conditions contained
within this Article.
Section 405.330. Expansions.

[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
Non-conforming uses of a less permanent nature are not to be expanded and they shall be abolished
or reduced to conformity as quickly as the fair interest to the parties will permit.
Section 405.335. Unsafe Structures.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of

following Section.
Section 405.340. Alterations.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
A non-conforming building or structure may be altered, improved or reconstructed, provided such work
is not to an extent exceeding in aggregate cost twenty-five percent (25%) of the reasonable value of
the building or structure, unless the building or structure is changed to a conforming use. The
regraveling of an existing gravel driveway and parking space serving a single-family residential
property shall not be deemed an alteration hereunder.
Section 405.345. Extensions.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
A non-conforming use shall not be extended, but the extension of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming
building or structure which existed prior to February 13, 2006, shall not be deemed the
extension of such non-conforming use.
Section 405.350. Prior Construction Approval.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction or designated use of a
building or structure for which a Building Permit has been issued and the construction of which shall
have been diligently prosecuted within ninety (90) days of the date of such permit.
Section 405.355. Restorations.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
Nothing in this Article shall prevent the reconstruction, repairing, rebuilding and continued use of any
non-conforming building or structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion or acts of God, subsequent
to February 13, 2006, wherein the expense of such work does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the
reasonable value of the building or structure at the time of such damage.
Section 405.360. Changes.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
No non-conforming building, structure or use shall be changed to another non-conforming use except
to one of the same or less objectionable character as the present non-conforming use.

February 13, 2006.
Section 405.380. District Changes.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]

Official who issues permits, except on matters of interpretation of the official Building Code adopted by
the City. Such appeals shall be administered as outlined in the Building Code. Under this Article no
such appeal lies from a decision of the City Council. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable
time, as shall be prescribed by the Board by general rule, by filing with the Building Commissioner or

grounds thereof. A fee in accordance with the schedule provided by Board regulation shall be paid by
the appellant. The Building Commissioner or other City Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all
the papers constituting the record upon which the action is appealed from. An appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Building Commissioner or City
Officer certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed that, by reason of fact
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Building Commissioner or City Officer's opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a

a part of this Chapter, where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street
layout as shown on the map aforesaid.
To vary, modify or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this Chapter in the
case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow or steep lots or other exceptional physical
conditions, whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building involved,
but in no other case. In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment shall prescribe any
conditions that it deems to be necessary or desirable. However, no variance in the strict
application of any provision of this Chapter shall be granted by the Board of Adjustment
unless it finds:
That there are special circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings,
applying to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or
conditions are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or
buildings in the neighborhood and that said circumstances or conditions are such that the
strict application of the provisions of this Chapter would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of such land or building.
That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of the variance is necessary
for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the
Board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this Chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to
the public welfare. In addition to considering the character and use of adjoining buildings
and those in the vicinity, the Board in determining its findings shall take into account the
number of persons residing or working in such buildings or upon land and traffic
conditions in the vicinity.

reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decisions or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made
and to that end shall have all the powers of the Building Commissioner or other City Officer, as well as
the powers delegated to the Board by this Chapter.
Section 405.415. Necessary Vote For Change.

requirement, decision or determination of Commissioner or other City Officer or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Chapter or to effect any
variation in this Chapter.

that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the ground of illegality. Such petition

the Board.
Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the
Board to review such decision of the Board and shall prescribe therein the time within which a
return thereto must be made and served upon the appellant's attorney, which shall be not less
than ten (10) days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay
proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to
the Board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order.
The Board shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be
sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be
called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be
pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified.
If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper
disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it
may direct and report the same to the court with findings of fact and conclusions of law which
shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be
made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought
up for review.
Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless it shall appear to the court that it acted
with gross negligence or in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from.

General Standards For Review For Certificate Of Appropriateness. In considering an application
for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the LHDC shall be guided in principle by the development
plan and guidelines for the Historic District, the Secretary of Interior's standards and any design
criteria or guidelines in the ordinance designating the Landmarks, Historic District Contributing
Resources or a Historic District and the following general standards:
A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be used for a purpose that requires
minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment;
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property should be avoided;
All sites, structures and objects shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations
that have no historical basis and which seek to create a false sense of history or architecture
should be avoided;
Alterations or additions that have acquired historic significance in their own right should be
retained and preserved;
Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a historic property should be preserved;
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced wherever feasible. In
the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of
missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or
the availability of different architectural elements from other structures or objects;
Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials should be avoided. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties should not be
discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant cultural, historical,
architectural or archaeological material and such design is compatible with the size, scale,
color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment;
Additions or alterations to structures and objects should be done in such a manner that if such
additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of
the structure would be unimpaired. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall
be compatible in massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity
of the property and its environment;
Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Secretary of the Interior's standards, certain
building materials are prohibited on Landmark structures, including the following:
Vinyl or aluminum siding. Masonite is accepted as long as it is not applied directly to the
original or historic material.
Any other imitation siding material designed to look like wood siding but fabricated from
an imitation material or materials.

about whether the maintenance, use and/or alteration of the property would cause
immediate and substantial harm of the property owner(s) because rehabilitation in a
manner which reserves the historic integrity of the property is not feasible from a
technical, mechanical or a structural standpoint and/or would leave the property with no
reasonable economic value because it would require an unreasonable expenditure of
money, taking into account such factors as current market value, permitted uses of the
property and the cost of compliance with applicable local, State and Federal codes;
Whether the demolition of the nominated or designated Landmark or Historic District
Contributing Structure will be detrimental to the historic and architectural character of the
neighborhood or District after balancing the interest of the City in preserving the integrity
of the neighborhood or the "H" Historic District and the interest of the property owner(s) in
the use or benefit of the property. In making its determination, the LHDC shall consider
whether the property can be put to a reasonable and beneficial use and shall consider
any economic hardship, as determined pursuant to the provisions herein, suffered by the
property owner(s) if demolition is denied;
The comments of any civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens concerning
any recommendations for the acquisition of property by public or private bodies or
agencies and exploration of the possibility of moving one (1) or more structures or other
features;
The denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition would cause an economic
hardship as defined and determined pursuant to the provisions herein.
The LHDC may defer the decision on a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition for up to
one (1) year from the date of application for a Demolition Permit. The applicant must
undertake bona fide efforts to preserve the structure. In determining whether a bona fide effort
has been made, the LHDC shall consider the following actions or lack thereof:
Marketing the property for sale or lease;
Filing an application for alternative funding sources for preservation, such as Federal or
State preservation tax credits, etc.; and
Filing an application for alternative uses if available or feasible, such as conditional uses,
etc.
Upon the completion of the one (1) year period and if the applicant provides evidence of a
bona fide preservation effort, LHDC shall make a final decision for the Certificate of
Appropriateness for demolition. The LHDC shall approve the Certificate of Appropriateness
for demolition, approve with modifications or deny the Certificate of Appropriateness for the
reuse plan for new construction pursuant to the provisions herein.
Upon approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition of a Landmark or Historic
District Contributing Resource, the LHDC shall require the applicant to provide archival quality
photographs, plans or elevation drawings, as available, necessary to record the structure
being demolished.
Prior to approval of any Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition, the LHDC shall review
the post-demolition plans. If the post-demolition plan is to landscape the site, a bond may be
required to ensure the completion of the landscape plan approved by the LHDC.
The bond shall be issued in a form approved by the City Attorney. The bond shall be in
an amount determined by the Building Commissioner and shall be sufficient to cover the
estimated costs to (1) restore the grade, (2) install an automatic sprinkling system, and
(3) to revegetate and landscape as per the approved plan.

Determinations By The Landmark And Historic District Commission.
The LHDC shall consider the completed application at its next regular meeting following
receipt of the completed application and, except for a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition, the LHDC shall makes its determination within ninety (90) days from the date that
it first considers the completed application, unless otherwise extended by the LHDC and the
applicant. The LHDC may delay for up to one (1) year a decision to approve or deny a
Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition in order to encourage and facilitate the sale of
the property. The LHDC may call special meetings to review applications for a Certificate of
Appropriateness when delay to the next regular meeting would create an unnecessary
inconvenience to the applicant.
The LHDC may approve, deny or approve in amended form the proposed plans subject to the
acceptance of the amendment by the applicant. If an applicant chooses not to accept a
proposed amendment, the application is considered denied. The LHDC shall state, in writing,
its reasons for the approval, approval in amended form or denial of the applicant's proposed
plans. Within three (3) working days following the determination, the Building Commissioner
shall provide written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness to the applicant.
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within
six (6) months of date of issuance or otherwise extended by the LHDC. Certificates of
Appropriateness shall be issued for a period of eighteen (18) months and are renewable by
the LHDC. All work performed pursuant to the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. It shall be the duty of the Building
Commissioner to inspect from time to time any work performed pursuant to such certificate to
assure such compliance. In the event work is performed without the issuance of a certificate
or not in accordance with such certificate, the Building Commissioner shall issue a stop work
order and all work shall cease.
Stop Work Order. Whenever the Building Commissioner or the LHDC has reason to believe that
an action for which a Certificate of Appropriateness is required has been initiated or is about to be
initiated or that a violation of the conditions of a Building Permit has occurred, the Building
Commissioner shall make every reasonable effort to contact the owners, occupants, contractor or
subcontractor and inform them of proper procedures. If the Building Commissioner determines
that a stop work order is necessary to halt an action, the Building Commissioner or his/her
designee shall issue a stop work order and deliver it or send it by certified mail return receipt
requested to the owners, occupants, contractors and subcontractors and notify them of the
process of applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness. A copy of the proper application form
shall be included in the notice. If necessary, a second (2nd) or subsequent stop work order may
be issued for the same project.
Review Of Public Improvement Projects. Public improvement projects by the City of Florissant or
any of its departments or agencies shall be reviewed by the LHDC in the following manner:

within two hundred (200) feet of any Landmarks or within two hundred (200) feet of any
boundary of an "H" Historic District. The Department of Public Works shall send a preliminary
design for a public improvement project to the LHDC. The LHDC shall have at least thirty (30)
days to complete its review and report to the City Council, except when the Department of
Public Works, if necessary to accelerate the design review process, may specify a time less
than thirty (30) days within which the LHDC shall complete its review and report to the
Council.

Section 405.475. Changes and Amendments.
[Ord. No. 7249 §1, 2-13-2006]
The City Council may from time to time, on its own motion or on petition, after at least fifteen (15)
days' public notice and hearings as provided by law, amend, supplement or change, modify or
repeal the boundaries or regulations herein or subsequently established after submitting same to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for its recommendations and report.
The Commission may make a preliminary report and may hold a public hearing thereon before
submitting its final report to the City Council.
In the case of an application for a change in the Zoning District Map which would apply to only one
(1) lot or parcel or two (2) or more contiguous lots or parcels, the Commission may request the
applicant to submit a site plan showing how the tract will be developed and to impose deed
restrictions controlling the use of the tract. The site plan shall meet the standards for a preliminary
subdivision plat and shall also indicate the location of building areas, parking, circulation, access
and open space. Material submitted therein shall show the location and character of proposed
signs, fences, landscaping and other data required by the Commission.
The Commission may condition its affirmative recommendation on the applicant's recording of the
site plan and deed restrictions which shall be enforceable by the Commission for a period of
twenty (20) years. Such plan and restrictions shall not be recorded until the City Council has
amended the Zoning District Map.
If, after a presentation to the Commission, a petition to transfer a tract of land from one Zoning
District to another is disapproved by said Commission, the Commission shall not reconsider a
presentation transferring the same tract of land to the same Zoning District requested in the
disapproved petition within six (6) months following the date of the aforesaid disapproval, unless
all members of the Commission present at a regular meeting approve such request for
reconsideration.
The Building Commissioner shall cause a sign or signs to be placed on each parcel of land on
which a Zoning District change or Special Use Permit has been requested from the City Council. A
copy of the public hearing notice regarding proposed change shall be attached to said sign. The
sign or signs shall be placed on such land at least ten (10) days prior to the public hearing to be
held by the City Council and shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon said land at a point
nearest the right-of-way of any street or roadway abutting such land.
In case, however, of a protest against such change duly signed and acknowledged by the owners
of thirty percent (30%) or more either of the area of the land (exclusive of streets and alleys)
included in such proposed change or within an area determined by lines drawn parallel to and one
hundred eighty-five (185) feet distance from the boundaries of the District proposed to be

by the City plan. If offered to the City for dedication, such parks may be accepted for
dedication and maintenance.
In order that potential dwellings displaced by parks or open space can be accommodated
in the subdivision, the yard, height and lot size established by the zoning ordinance for
that tract or parcel can be waived by the Commission. The Commission shall waive these
requirements only when it finds that the proposed subdivision makes good use of
topography and natural features, provides needed open space and contributes variety
and interest to the character of its neighborhood without adversely affecting adjacent
property. Requirements such as for side or rear yard, replacing those that are waived
under this provision, shall be included in the subdivision plat or restrictions, and
subsequent replacement and extension of buildings shall be controlled by such plat or
restrictions.
Streets.
The location, width and typical cross section of all streets shall conform to the City plan
and shall be designed to relate to existing and future streets, to topographical and natural
conditions, to public convenience and necessity, to visual character, and to the proposed
uses of the land to be served by the street. The subdivider may be required to continue
adjoining streets through the area being subdivided when necessary to provide for local
movements of vehicles or to enable adjoining property to be properly subdivided.
Streets shall have the following rights-of-way, except as increased or decreased by the
City plan or varied in unusual circumstances by the Commission:
Major streets, eighty (80) feet.
Collector streets, sixty (60) feet.
Minor streets, fifty (50) feet.
Frontage roads, fifty (50) feet.
Where a minor street is required to terminate in a circular open space, said open space
shall have a minimum radius of fifty (50) feet. Except in unusual instances, no such
street, including cul-de-sac, shall exceed six hundred (600) feet in length.
Intersections with a major street or collector street shall be designed as nearly as
possible at right angles.
Streets may be retained as private streets or offered for dedication as public streets, but
the Commission may require that certain streets be dedicated.
Reserve strips controlling access are prohibited except when control is placed with the
City under conditions approved by the Commission. Where streets are to be retained as
private streets, they shall be constructed to conform with the provisions of this Chapter
relative to dedicated streets, and all provisions of this Chapter shall apply thereto,
although continued to be maintained as private streets. All escrow funds and any other
provisions pertaining to streets contained in this Chapter shall apply to the construction
and maintenance of private streets or streets that are to be maintained as private streets
after construction thereof.
When a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the
Commission may require a frontage road, or on a major street reverse frontage with a
reservation of land along the rear property line through which no access shall be
permitted, deep lots with rear service alley, or such other treatment as may be
appropriate to separate through and local traffic, to develop all major streets according to
limited access principles and to protect residential uses from through traffic.

Easements.
Easements not less than five (5) feet wide shall be provided on each side of all rear lot
lines, and side lines where necessary, for poles, wires, conduits, sanitary sewers, gas,
water and heat mains, and storm sewers and stormwater drainage improvements.
Easements of greater width may be required along lines or across lots where necessary
for the extension of mains, sewers, utilities and sidewalks or crosswalks. When alleys are
provided, utilities may be located within the alley.
Whenever any stream or surface drainage course is located in an area that is being
subdivided within the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, the subdivider shall dedicate
an adequate easement as required by the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District for the
purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, realigning, improving or protecting the stream
or surface drainage course.
Where any stream or surface drainage course is located in an area that is being
subdivided outside the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, the subdivider shall
dedicate, as determined by the Commission, an adequate easement for the purpose of
widening, deepening, sloping, realigning, improving or protecting the stream or surface
drainage course.
Blocks.
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with regard to adequate
building sites suitable to the special needs of the use contemplated and the limitations
and opportunities of topography.
No block shall be longer than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet between intersecting streets. A
crosswalk of ten (10) feet may be required when necessary for pedestrian access and
circulation.
Blocks adjacent to a major street shall be designed to minimize points of ingress and
egress.
Lots.
All lots shall be designed to provide desirable building sites properly related to
topography, natural features, streets and land use. Except as required below, the
minimum area of any lot shall be that required by the zoning ordinance, with no less than
fifty (50) feet of width at the building line, but larger or smaller lots than established by the
zoning ordinance may be required or permitted by the Commission in order that private
parks or open space can be accommodated as provided by Section 410.050(1)(b),
dwellings can be separated from major street traffic as required by Section 410.050(2)(f),
or as demanded by any other standard, purpose or policy of the City plan or this Chapter.
When a lot has an area less than three (3) acres:
It must be served by either a public or private sewer system.
It must be served by a public water system.
Where the minimum lot area is three (3) acres or more:
A lot may be served by a septic tank or private water supply.
Its least dimension shall be three hundred fifty (350) feet.
It should have access to frontage road, collector street, minor streets but not a major
street.

Where a lot is located at the intersection of two (2) or more streets, extra width shall be
provided sufficient to permit the establishment of front building lines on both the front and
the side, or sides, of the lots adjoining the street.
Depth and width of lots laid out for other than single-family dwelling purposes shall be
adequate for off-street service, parking and protection of adjacent uses of streets.
Building lines.
Building lines required by the zoning ordinance shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use of any character and on non-residential lots immediately adjoining
residential areas.
In the interest of good design (to avoid monotony) or to meet other standards of this
Chapter or the City plan, the Commission may permit a variation in the building line as
required by the zoning ordinance for the district in which the lot is to be located.
The subdivision plat or restrictions shall require that all enclosed parts or buildings be set
back of building lines. Yard and height restrictions shall also be included when required
by the provisions of Section 410.050(1)(b).
Maintenance of common facilities. Where the subdivision contains paving, sewers, sewage
treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities
necessary or desirable for the common use or benefit which are not or cannot be satisfactorily
maintained by any existing public agency, provision shall be made by trust agreement made a
part of the deed restrictions, or protective covenants acceptable to any agency having
jurisdiction over the location and improvement of such facilities, for the proper and continuous
maintenance and supervision of such facilities.
Improvements. Before the final plat of any subdivided area shall be approved by the City
Council and recorded, the subdivider shall make and install the improvements described in
this Subsection. In lieu of final completion of the minimum improvements before the plat is
finally approved, the subdivider may post a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow
agreement approved by the City Attorney of the City of Florissant, which bond, letter of credit
or escrow agreement will insure to the City that the improvements will be completed in the
event the subdivider abandons the subdivision or fails to install the minimum improvements
within two (2) years after the final approval of the plat, whichever shall occur first. The amount
of the bond, letter of credit or escrow agreement shall not be less than the estimated cost of
the improvements, and the amount of the estimate must be approved by the City Engineer.
Said estimate shall be prepared by the subdivider on forms furnished by the City of Florissant.
If the improvements are not completed within the specified time, the City Council may use the
bond, letter of credit or funds in escrow, or any necessary portion thereof, to complete same.
Should the subdivider desire to provide a surety bond or letter of credit, the bond form or
letter of credit shall be in a form as approved by the City Attorney.
Should the subdivider desire to provide an escrow agreement, it shall:
Be approved by the City Attorney as to legal form;
Upon approval by the City Council be executed by the Mayor;
Guarantee the improvements set forth in the approved final plat by providing for a
deposit with an approved escrow depositary;
Provide that the escrowed sum shall be held in special escrow account by the

provided, until such time as the Mayor shall, upon approval by the City Council by
written authorization addressed to the escrow holder, release the escrow funds. In
no case shall an authorization be given for the release of more than seventy percent
(70%) of the escrowed sum allocated for each specific improvement or installation
during construction. When a specific improvement or installation has been
completed in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance and is approved by the
City Engineer, an authorization shall be given for the release of a sum not to exceed
an additional twenty percent (20%) of the escrowed sum allocated for such specific
improvement or installation. Upon the completion of all improvements or installations
in accordance with the provision of this Chapter and approval and acceptance for
dedication and/or maintenance by the City Council, an authorization shall be given
for the release of the remaining ten percent (10%) of the escrowed funds; provided
however, that in the event that all improvements or installations are completed
except for ten percent (10%) or less of the total amount of sidewalks remaining to be
installed in a subdivision, the City Council may approve and accept for dedication
and maintenance the streets of said subdivision and authorize the release of all
remaining escrowed funds upon the tendering by the developer of a cash deposit to
the City of Florissant in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%)
of the estimated contract cost for installation of the remaining sidewalks in a
subdivision and further upon submission of a written agreement executed by the
developer guaranteeing the completion of the remaining sidewalks in the subdivision
within eighteen (18) months of the date of the approval and acceptance for
dedication and maintenance of the streets of said subdivision and authorizing the
City of Florissant, upon failure of the developer to complete the sidewalks as
indicated herein, to complete the installation of the sidewalks, or contract for such
installation, and to use the cash deposit for payment of such installation.
Should the subdivider abandon the subdivision or fail to complete the improvements
within two (2) years from the date of the City's approval of the final plat of the
subdivision, whichever shall occur first, except as provided in paragraph (5) above,
the City may complete or have completed the said improvements and the escrow
holder shall then disburse the escrow funds therefor as ordered and directed by the
Mayor upon approval of the City Council.
The form for said escrow agreement shall be as approved by the City Attorney.

Construction methods.
Equipment and tools necessary for handling materials and performing all
parts of the work must meet the approval of the Director of Public Works as
to design, capacity and mechanical conditions and must be on the job
before the work is started. Any equipment which is not maintained in full
working order or which, as used by the contractor, is inadequate to obtain
the results prescribed, shall be improved or similar equipment substituted or
added as directed by the engineer.
The subgrade shall be cleared of large stones, sod, trees, roots, rubbish
and other debris. Holes and irregularities shall be filled and compacted to
uniform density and the subgrade shaped and finished to conform to the
lines and grades as shown on the plans. All soft, loose or yielding material
of the subgrade that will not compact when rolled or tamped shall be
removed and replaced with suitable material placed and compacted as
specified herein. The compacted subgrade shall extend laterally a minimum
of one (1) foot beyond the outer limits of the forms. Fill materials shall be
placed in layers not exceeding six (6) inches in depth and be compacted by
rolling, vibrating or tamping to ninety percent (90%) maximum density
according to ASTM Test 698-65. The same density is required in cut section
as in fill sections.
The approved subgrade and inspected forms shall be in place and ready for
paving not less than three hundred (300) feet ahead of the paving
operation.
The subgrade shall be moist but not muddy when placing concrete.
Wash water from mixers will not be permitted on the subgrade and will not
be deposited in any drainage structures.
Forms.
Forms shall be true to line and grade and securely staked so as to be
unyielding during concreting operations. Top faces of forms shall not vary
from a true plane more than one-fourth (¼) inch in ten (10) feet.
Earth under the forms shall be securely compacted prior to placing of
concrete.
The method of connecting form sections shall be such as to insure a right,
neat joint. Each time forms are used, they shall be cleaned thoroughly and
oiled before concrete is placed against them.
Mixing and placing concrete.
A uniform consistency of concrete shall be maintained at all times. The
concrete shall be consolidated by means of a vibrating screed or an

oscillating machine. If said screed does not impart the necessary vibrating
energy, in the opinion of the engineer, it shall be improved or replaced to
his/her satisfaction. The concrete slump shall not exceed four (4) inches.
Consolidation by hand will be permitted only in special cases and then
under the specific direction of the engineer.
Concrete may be mixed on the site in a batch mixer, mixed in transit mixers
or mixed in a central mixing plant. Sufficient notice shall be given the
Director of Public Works, prior to placing concrete, of the method of mixing
to be used so that mixing and delivery equipment can be checked and
approved for use.
All longitudinal and transverse joints shall conform to the detail as set out in
the typical sections of these standard specifications. These points shall be
straight and perpendicular to the pavement surface. The transverse joints
shall be at right angles to the edge of the pavement. Care must be taken to
avoid over-finishing at joints.
Concrete shall be placed between the side forms in successive batches for
the entire width of the construction lane to such elevations above grade that
when consolidated and finished, the surface of the pavement shall be at the
specified final grade elevations. It shall then be thoroughly consolidated
with the vibrating screed to the crown, cross section and finished surface
elevation indicated on the plans.
At the option of the Director of Public Works, the City may sample and test
for the cement content of the plastic concrete according to the Willis-Hime
method. If two (2) successive samples from loads show a cement content
of less than ninety percent (90%) of that required in these specifications,
the contractor must secure concrete from another supplier or if the
contractor is mixing the concrete on the site, proper correction as approved
by the engineer must be made to the mix proportions to meet requirements
of these specifications or construction will be stopped.
Transverse and dowelled construction joints (as indicated on the typical
sections) shall be installed at the close of each day's work or when
interruptions of more than thirty (30) minutes occur. It shall be located at
least five (5) feet from any other transverse joint. It shall be formed from a
clean wood plank, cut identical with the cross section of the pavement with
holes drilled for dowel bars. The plank shall be accurately set and held
securely in place at right angles to the edge of the pavement. When
operations are resumed, the plank shall be carefully removed and all
surplus concrete or materials on the subgrade removed and fresh concrete
deposited directly against the old.
The pavement surface shall be floated and straight-edged to a true surface
as called for on the plans. Finishing operations shall be such as to require a
minimum of manipulation from initial placing to finished surface. The final
pavement surface finish may be accomplished by belting, brooming or
burlap drag depending upon the wishes of the engineer.
Integral lib curb shall be cast monolithic with the pavement. It shall be
formed with a steel finishing tool known as a "mule" fabricated to the exact
cross section and dimensions set forth in the curb detail in the typical
section. Care must be exercised to insure a well-defined outer section to
accomplish complete drainage to the nearest inlet structure in accordance
with the plans. Incomplete gutter drainage will be subject to correction at
the discretion of the engineer. Grades less than one and one-half percent

and a small level mounted on top and at the center.
All joints shall be edged with a tool having an approximate radius of oneeighth
(1/8) inch, except in instances when the premolded type contraction
joint is used. (See typical section this detail.)
Final surface test. The contractor will be held responsible for the correct
alignment, grade and contour specified. Any spots higher than one-fourth
(¼) inch in ten (10) feet for concrete pavements shall be ground to the
required surface by the contractor at his/her own expense.
Curing.
As soon as practicable after pavement is finished and without marring the
surface, the concrete shall be cured by a standard recognized method with
materials approved by the Director of Public Works; e.g., membrane spray,
wet burlap, wet straw or watertight plastic cover.
After the concrete has been finally finished and the water sheen has left the
surface, the entire area of the pavement surface shall be sealed by hand
spraying or machine spraying there on a uniform application of the white
pigmented membrane curing solution. The solution shall be applied in one
(1) or two (2) separate applications as may be recommended by the
manufacturer and as directed by the engineer. If the solution is applied in
two (2) increments, the second (2nd) application shall follow the first (1st)
application within thirty (30) minutes.
The contractor shall provide satisfactory equipment and means to properly
control and assure the direct application of the curing solution on the
pavement surface as to result in a uniform coverage on the pavement at the
rate of one (1) gallon for each two hundred (200) square feet of area.
White pigmented membrane curing compound shall conform to the
requirements of ASTM C-309-58 Type 2 all-resin base or the latest revision
thereof.
The curing solution shall be delivered to the job only in the manufacturer's
name, trade name of the material, and lot number with which test samples
may be correlated.
If rain falls on the newly coated pavement before the film has dried
sufficiently to resist damage, or if the film is damaged in any other way, the
contractor will be required to apply a new coat of material to the affected
portions equal in curing value to that above specified. All areas cut by
finishing tools subsequent to the application of the curing solution shall
immediately be given new applications at the rate of specified above.
When joints are formed by sawing, the same method of curing as applied to
the pavement shall be reapplied to the freshly cut joints as soon as
practicable after the sawing operation.
The contractor shall provide on the job sufficient burlap for the protection of
the pavement in case of rain or breakdown of the spray equipment. In the
event that hair-checking develops before the membrane can be applied,
wet burlap shall be used to cover the surface of the pavement for not less
than twenty-four (24) hours before the membrane application.

Curing of the pavement shall be continued for not less than seven (7) days
after placement of the concrete.
When forms are removed sooner than the seven (7) day curing period, and
when new concrete is not to be placed against the exposed end, surfaces
shall be treated with curing membrane.
Cold weather concreting.
Except by specific written authorization by the Director of Public Works,
concrete placing shall cease when the descending air temperature in the
shade falls below forty degrees Fahrenheit (40°F). When concreting is
permitted during cold weather, the temperature of the mixed concrete shall
be not less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) nor more than one hundred
degrees Fahrenheit (100°F) at the time of placing in the forms. The
aggregates may be heated by steam or dry heat prior to being placed in the
mixer. The water shall not be hotter than one hundred seventy degrees
Fahrenheit (170°F). When concrete is being placed during cold weather
and the air temperature may be expected to drop below thirty-four degrees
Fahrenheit (34°F), a supply of straw or other suitable blanketing material
shall be provided along the line of the work. Care must be exercised to
prevent the wind from removing same. At any other time when the air
temperature may be expected to reach the freezing point during the day or
night, the material so provided shall be spread over the concrete to a
sufficient depth to prevent freezing of the concrete. Such protection shall be
maintained for at least five (5) days. If required by the Director of Public
Works, concrete less than twenty-four (24) hours old shall also be covered
by approved devices capable of maintaining the temperature within the
concrete at fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F) or higher. Concrete injured by
frost action shall be removed and replaced at the contractor's expense.
Opening to traffic.
The pavement shall not be opened to traffic or contractor's equipment until
so ordered by the Director of Public Works. The contractor shall maintain
adequate barricades and protection to the pavement to prevent traffic from
using the pavement until opened by the Director of Public Works.
Sealing joints. Joint filler shall be RC-3 hot-poured asphalt or its equal. The
top of expansion joints and all edged joints shall be sealed with the
specified filler before traffic is permitted on the pavement. The joint shall be
surfaced dried and thoroughly cleaned of all foreign matter before the
sealing material is poured. The filler shall be poured into the joint opening to
conform to the details shown on the plans or as directed by the Director of
Public Works. The pouring shall be done in such a manner that the material
will not be spilled on the exposed surfaces of the concrete. Any excess filler
on the surface of the concrete pavement shall be removed immediately and
the pavement surface cleaned. When required to prevent tackiness or
pickup under traffic, the exposed surface of the filler shall be dusted with
hydrated lime or sawdust. Sand will not be permitted. Other methods of
preventing pickup under traffic may be used when approved by the Director
of Public Works. Poured filler shall not be placed when the air temperature
in the shade is less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50°F).
Thickness deficiencies.
General. It is the intent of these specifications that the pavement shall be
constructed strictly in accordance with the thickness shown on the plans.

The thickness of the pavement shall be measured, and where any
pavement is found not so constructed, such pavement may be
compensated for by reimbursing the City of Florissant at a unit price per
square yard or such pavement may be removed and replaced with
satisfactory pavement.
Measurements. The thickness of the pavements will be determined by the
thickness of cores taken from the pavement of such locations as the
Director of Public Works may select. Three (3) or more cores per lane will
be taken in each one thousand (1,000) linear feet of pavement and
measured in accordance with ASTM C174-49. The same rates of core
locations will be selected over the entire length of projects, where the total
lengths [length] of the pavement is less than one thousand (1,000) feet.
Whenever any cores indicate that the pavement is deficient in specified
thickness, the contractor will be notified. If any test core is found which is
deficient in thickness, additional cores shall be taken on each side of the
place from which the core is drilled, on a line parallel to the centerline of the
pavement until cores are found, on each side of the first (1st) test core,
which are not deficient. The intervals are to be selected by the contractor
and the Director of Public Works. All pavement midway between the last
test cores taken and the longitudinal joint and the curb or between
longitudinal joints will be considered as being deficient, removed and
replaced or compensated for as provided below. If the contractors elect to
drill additional cores, it will be accomplished in the presence of an inspector,
and the contractors shall pay the additional cost of drilling.
Drilling of cores and all work necessary and incidental thereto will be
considered inspection and will be charged against the inspection fee
deposited by the subdivision developers, other than additional cores
desired by the contractors as stated above.
Compensation for thickness deficiencies when core measurements
[measurement] of thickness is found which is less than the thickness shown
on the plans, the reimbursements for deficiencies as shown on the
schedule below shall apply and will be paid to the City of Florissant.
1) 0.00 inch up to and 0.30 inch None
2) Over 0.30 inch up to and 0.50 inch 20% of estimated cost*
3) Over 0.50 inch up to and 1.00 inch 40% of estimated cost*
Remove and replace or
4) Over 1.00 inch 100% of estimated cost*
* The estimated cost shall be computed at the rate per square yard of
pavement used in determining the amount of the developer's escrow
deposit. The choice of alternate penalty under category (4) above will
be at the sole discretion of the City of Florissant. The amount of
reimbursement shall be deposited with the City of Florissant. Upon
application and approval by the Building Commissioner, a bituminous
macadam or asphalt street may be used when a subdivision fronts
an existing street with the same construction.
Major streets or collector streets may be improved with a twenty-four (24) foot
pavement and a six (6) foot all-weather disaster shoulder on both sides when there
are no lots having direct access to such streets.

All lots less than three (3) acres in area to be created by subdivision shall be served
by the City of Florissant water system. When the area cannot be immediately served
by the City of Florissant water system, then the Council shall permit service by
another public utility.
When the subdivision is to be served by the City of Florissant water system, the
subdivider shall comply with the ordinances relative to payment for the installation of
water mains and fire hydrants in the subdivided area. Such installation of the water
mains and fire hydrants aforesaid shall be done by the City of Florissant. The water
mains and hydrants, when installed, shall become at once the property of the City of
Florissant, and said City shall have exclusive control and use thereof, subject to the
right of the residents of the subdivided area to be connected therewith, and subject
to the ordinances governing the extension of water mains.
When the subdivision is to be served by another public utility, the subdivider shall
show the Council prior to approval of the final plat that mains and hydrants have
been installed or security provided in lieu thereof to the satisfaction of the public
utility, and that hydrants have been located as required by the standards of the
Missouri Inspection Bureau.
The subdivider shall install sanitary sewers and provide a connection for each lot.
Such installations shall be in accordance with the standards and specifications of
and before the improvement is started the plan therefor shall be approved by the
Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and the Commission. If no existing outlet
sewers are within reasonable distance, the subdivider shall make such provisions for
the treatment or disposal of the sewerage as will satisfy the Metropolitan St. Louis
Sewer District, City, State and County health officials and before the plat shall be
approved, the subdivider shall present to the Commission an order from the
Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, City and State or County health officials
showing that the treatment or disposal facilities will properly care for and protect the
health, safety and welfare of the existing and probable future population within the
subdivision and surrounding area. In no event, however, shall the subdivider be
required to install treatment facilities larger than are necessary to serve the land to
be subdivided. A proposed subdivision in an area to be annexed may be connected
to existing sewers and payment for maintenance or connecting charges and
recovery of excess cost shall be as provided for in Ordinances 391 and 605. Should
the subdivider contemplate the recovery of excess costs due to the installation of
certain sewer facilities as provided for in Ordinances 391 and 605[2] of the City of
Florissant, said subdivider shall apply for the recovery of said excess costs in writing
to the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and to the City of Florissant. Said
application shall contain complete information as to the type, location, materials to
be used, size, length, and any other factor pertaining to the facilities to be installed,
together with the estimated cost thereof. Said estimated cost shall contain a
breakdown as to materials, labor, services and any other item considered part
thereof. The approval of said application by both the sewer district and the City
Council shall be required prior to the commencement of the construction of such
facilities. If said approval is not obtained, no future claim for excess sewer costs
under the aforementioned ordinances will be considered by the City of Florissant.
Editor's Note--Ordinances 391 and 605 have not been set out in this volume but
were saved from repeal and may be found on file in the office of the City Clerk.
When the subdivision is located within the boundaries of Metropolitan St. Louis
Sewer District, storm sewers and stormwater drainage improvements shall be
installed in accordance with the requirements of the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer
District.

Chapter 415. Floodplain Management
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and
Purposes.
[Ord. No. 8101 §1,[1] 12-8-2014]
Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has, in RSMo. 89.020, delegated
the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City
of Florissant, Missouri, ordains as follows.
Findings Of Fact.
Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Florissant, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in
flood heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of
a series of interrelated steps:

Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which
could be expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year, as
delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for St.
Louis County dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights
more than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted
that would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 415.010(B)(1); to establish or
maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding
or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be
provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided for the repeal of former Ch. 415, Flood Damage Prevention
and Control, adopted by Code 1980 §§ 6-38 — 6-42, as amended.
Section 415.020. General Provisions.
Lands To Which Chapter Applies. This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Florissant, Missouri, identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones, on
the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for St. Louis County on Map Panels, 29189C0035K,
29189C0042K, 29189C0053K, 29189C0054K, 29189C0058K, 29189C0061K, 29189C0062K,
29189C0064K, 29189C0066K, 29189C0067K, and 29189C0068K, dated February 4, 2015, as
amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Chapter, no development
shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the
City Council or its duly designated representative, under such safeguards and restrictions as the
City Council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and
maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically
noted in Section 415.040.
Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator
under this Chapter.

Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall
be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this Chapter and other applicable regulations.
Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to
be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not
be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions, or the flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not
create a liability on the part of the City of Florissant, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall
not be affected thereby.
Section 415.030. Administration.
Floodplain Development Permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required for all
proposed construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured homes, in
the areas described in Section 415.020(A). No person, firm, corporation, or unit of government
shall initiate any development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without
first obtaining a separate floodplain development permit for each structure or other development.
Designation Of Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer is hereby appointed to administer and
implement the provisions of this Chapter.
Duties And Responsibilities Of Floodplain Administrator. Duties of the City Engineer shall include,
but not be limited to:

administrator as set forth in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations.
All critical facilities shall have access routes that are above the elevation of the fivehundred-
year flood.
Hazardous materials. All hazardous material storage and handling sites shall be located out
of the floodplain.
Specific Standards.
In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones, where base
flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Section 415.040(A)(2), the following
provisions are required:
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured
homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above
the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards
of this Subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain
administrator as set forth in Section 415.030(C)(9).
Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in
an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1)
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided; and
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Manufactured Homes.
All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE
Zones on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices
that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must
be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors.

manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred
substantial damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that
the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A
Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of
Section 415.040(C)(2) of this Section, be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot above the base flood level;
or
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in
height above grade and is securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 415.020(A) are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall
apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Section 415.040(D)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 415.040.
In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as
set forth in Section 415.040(A)(2).
Recreational Vehicles.
Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A
Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM either:
Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or
Meet the permitting, elevation, and the anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
of this Chapter.
* A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Section 415.050. Floodplain Management Variance Procedures.
Establishment Of Appeal Board. The Board of Adjustment as established by the City of Florissant
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management
requirements of this Chapter.
Responsibility Of Appeal Board.
Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations is denied by the City Engineer, the applicant may apply
for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment, as
defined in Section 415.050(A).
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the City Engineer in the
enforcement or administration of this Chapter.
Further Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the St. Louis County Circuit Court as provided in RSMo.
89.110.
Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the following criteria:
The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems; streets; and bridges.
Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
Subsection (E)(2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases

beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or a
local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not
preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant, in writing, over the signature of a community official,
that: the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Section.
Section 415.060. Penalties for Violation.
Violation of the provisions of this Chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of variances) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00),
and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of
Florissant or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.

[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
The Code Official is authorized to estimate the total cost of construction of a structure, building or
project, by multiplying the total floor area of the structure in square feet by an appropriate squarefoot-
cost rate as published by the International Code Council. Structures or projects for which it is
impractical to estimate the total construction cost by said square-foot-cost method shall be
estimated by applying current, commonly accepted unit cost figures to the various components in
a commonly accepted manner. In lieu of determining the total cost of construction as outlined
above, the Code Official may accept a bona fide contract or any affidavit of the owner of the
building structure or project, in which the total cost of construction, including site improvements
related to the permit, is verified by the applicant and owner.
The method to be used for calculating the estimated value for the construction of any building for
the purpose of a building permit fee calculation shall be by one (1) of the following methods in
which the highest figure shall be used:
The construction cost may be taken as that cost which was submitted on the permit
application.
The construction cost and permit fee may be calculated using the most recent building
valuation data report as published by the International Code Council (ICC). This cost shall be
determined by using one hundred percent (100%) of the square footage cost given in the
table. The calculation shall be required in writing provided by the applicant.

Masonite or three-eighths-inch plywood, cut to fit within the openings, fastened in place as
securely as possible and suitably coated with an appropriate neutral color harmonizing with
the exterior colors of the building as inconspicuously as possible. Such work shall be
performed in a neat and workmanlike manner.
All signs and signposts, other than real estate signs, relating to such premises shall be
removed.
Every window, glazed exterior door, exterior transom or exterior sidelight of an unoccupied
building shall be provided with properly installed glass or other approved glazing material, and
in the event of breakage the owner shall immediately remove all broken glass and temporarily
board up with suitable materials.
Any such building which had been used as a service station shall have all above-ground pumps
and pump islands removed, and all underground tanks shall be filled with sand.
The owner of any building or structure subject hereto who shall fail to comply with these
requirements, ten (10) days after written notice thereof from the Building Commissioner, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to the penalties
provided for violation of City ordinances.

Section 505.405. Introduction.
[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
On construction or land disturbance sites, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water.
Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic
habitat for fish and other desirable species. Deposits of eroded soil also necessitate maintenance of
sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes; in addition, clearing and grading during construction
cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. Construction activities
also utilize materials and generate wastes which, if not properly controlled, can pollute receiving
waters.
Section 505.410. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
The purpose of this code is to safeguard persons, protect property and prevent damage to the
environment in the City of Florissant. This code will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other
activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in Florissant,
Missouri.
Section 505.415. Scope.
[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
This code provides for the safety, health and welfare of the public by regulating and controlling the
design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs land
surfaces or results in the movement of earth in Florissant, Missouri.

[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]

Prosecution Of Violation. If the violator does not abate the violation promptly, the Department of
Public Works shall request the appropriate prosecuting attorney to institute the appropriate
proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate such violation.
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this code or who shall fail to
comply with any of the requirements thereof or who shall perform work in violation of the approved
construction documents or the stormwater pollution prevention plan or any directive of the
Department of Public Works and Traffic or of a permit or certificate issued under the provisions of
this code or shall start any work requiring a permit without first obtaining a permit therefor or who
shall continue any work in or about a structure after having been served a stop-work order, except
for such work which that person, firm or corporation has been directed to perform to remove a
violation or unsafe conditions, or any owner of a property or any other person who commits, takes
part or assists in any violation of this code or who maintains any property on which such violation
shall exist shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days, or both such fine and

No Permit Penalty. In addition to the penalties set out above, the following procedure shall be

started prior to the acquisition of a permit required by this code:
The Department of Public Works shall issue a stop-work order.
The department Director shall notify the violator of his/her assessment regarding the
appropriate penalty amount to be assessed against the violator, which shall not exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each day that work occurs without a permit. In making the
assessment, the department shall consider whether the violator has previously violated this
code and whether the occupation or experience of the violator indicates that he/she knew or
should have known that a permit was required. In no case will a no-permit penalty be
assessed against a property owner unless he/she actually performed the work involved.
At the violator's option, he/she may deposit the assessed penalty amount in escrow (certified
check or cash only) with the Department of Public Works, in which case the violator's right to
a hearing will be preserved.
No permit penalties are appealable to the Building Code Board of Appeals in the same
manner as other decisions of the department. The department may revise its assessment
upon notice to both the Board of Appeals and the violator at any time prior to the hearing.
Likewise, at any time prior to the hearing, the violator may accept and pay the recommended
penalty amount, and the hearing will be canceled.
At the hearing before the Building Code Board of Appeals, said Board of Appeals shall afford
both the department and the alleged violator an opportunity to present any evidence or make
any statements they wish to have considered.
Following the hearing the Building Code Board of Appeals shall determine whether a permit
was required.
If the Board determines that a permit was required, an appropriate penalty amount shall
be assessed, taking into account the same considerations as noted above. The stopwork
order shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the penalty amount is
paid and the violator has complied with all other regulations pertaining to the issuance of
permits.
If the Board determines that no permit was required, the department shall immediately
cancel the stop-work order.

[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
This Article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection
area as defined in Section 505.530 of this Article. These requirements are in addition to, and do
not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer or floodplain requirements established under
State or local law, and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval
or exemption from buffer requirements established under State law or from other applicable local,
State or Federal regulations.
Legal Non-Conforming Provisions. The following shall not apply to this Article:
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and
approved for such use on or before the effective date of this Article.
Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities, including, but not limited to,
existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that
new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all
applicable buffer requirements.
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development,
scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of
this Article.
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval but that is part of a larger
master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has
been previously approved within two (2) years of the effective date of this Article.
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this Article. Exemption of these
activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
Activities for the purpose of building one (1) of the following:
A stream crossing by a driveway (bridge), transportation route or utility line;
Public water supply intake or public wastewater structures or stormwater outfalls;
Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property;
Public access facilities that must be on the water, including boat ramps, docks, foot trails
leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks;
Foot trails and paths, pervious or impervious, approved only by the Director of Public
Works;
Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or
aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used and
said work is approved by the Director of Public Works.
Public Line Easements. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation
and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve
structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike
paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except
for access for the uses specifically cited in Subsection (C)(1) above.
Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this Article takes effect
or approved under the terms of this Article.

Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this Article takes effect or approved
under the terms of this Article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is
necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to,
manholes, vents and valve structures.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is
performed under this Section, the person performing it shall report such work to the Director
of Public Works on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten (10)
days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time
period as may be determined by the review and permitting authority to be reasonably
necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water
conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural
uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land
disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land-disturbing
activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property
for three (3) years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
Any activities approved under a 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers and 401 water
quality certification issued by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. After the
effective date of this Article, the requirements herein shall apply to new subdivisions and
platting activities. Any land-development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any
impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is
granted pursuant to Section 505.550 of this Article.
Section 505.550. Land Development Requirements.
[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
Buffer And Setback Requirements. All land development activity subject to this Article shall meet
the following requirements:
For streams depicted as a solid blue line on the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
map, an undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty (50) feet, measured
horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the
stream bank. For all other streams subject to this Article, an undisturbed natural vegetative
buffer shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as
applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.
An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally,
beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be
prohibited, except pervious paving shall be allowed when reviewed and approved by the
Director of Public Works. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the
setback.
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted
in accordance with the following provisions:
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this Article, and its shape, topography
or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this Article, and
the Director of Public Works finds and determines that the requirements of this Article prohibit
the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the City Council may grant a variance
from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires
mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.

Except as provided above, the City Council shall grant no variance from any provision of this
Article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing
the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the City Council. The City of Florissant
shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation
within the City of Florissant. The City of Florissant shall require that the applicant post a sign
giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and
posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent
road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the
adoption of this Article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this
Article would create an extreme hardship. Variances will not be considered when, following
adoption of this Article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created
conditions of a hardship on that property.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and
other natural features as determined by field survey;
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical
characteristics of the property;
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and
other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both
inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected
shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
At least one (1) alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or
an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request
must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the
property;
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the
environment.

Section 505.580. Responsibility.
[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the
provisions of this Article shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for

Section 510.270. Duties Of Building Commissioner.
[Ord. No. 8487, 1-14-2019]
The Building Commissioner shall have the powers and duties pursuant to this Chapter to:
Supervise all inspections required by this Chapter and cause the Building Inspector to make
inspections and perform all the duties required of him/her by this Chapter. Upon receiving a
complaint or report from any source that a dangerous building exists in the City, the Building
Commissioner shall cause an inspection to be made forthwith. If the Building Commissioner
deems it necessary to the performance of his/her duties and responsibilities imposed herein,
the Building Commissioner may request an inspection and report be made by any other City
department or retain services of an expert whenever the Building Commissioner deems such
service necessary.
Upon receipt of a report from the Building Inspector indicating failure by the owner, lessee,
occupant, mortgagee, agent or other persons(s) having an interest in said building to
commence work of reconditioning or demolition within the time specified by this Chapter or
upon failure to proceed continuously with work without unnecessary delay, hold a hearing
giving the affected parties full and adequate hearing on the matter.
Give written notice of said hearing, either by personal service or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or if service cannot be had by either of those modes of service, then by
publication in a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices, at least ten (10) days in advance
of the hearing date, to the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent and all other persons
having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the Recorder of Deeds of
St. Louis County who may appear before the Director of Public Works on the date specified in
the notice to show cause why the building or structure reported to be a dangerous building
should not be repaired, vacated or demolished in accordance with the statement of particulars
set forth in the Building Inspector's notice as provided herein. Any party may be represented
by counsel, and all parties shall have an opportunity to be heard.
The Director of Public Works will make written findings of fact from the evidence offered at
said hearing as to whether or not the building in question is a dangerous building within the
terms of Section 510.220 of this Chapter.
If the evidence supports a finding based upon competent and substantial evidence that the
building or structure is a dangerous building and a nuisance and detrimental to the health,
safety or welfare of the residents of the City, the Director of Public Works shall issue an order
based upon its findings of fact commanding the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent or
other persons(s) having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the
Recorder of Deeds of St. Louis County to repair, vacate or demolish any building found to be
a dangerous building and to clean up the property, provided that any person so notified shall
have the privilege of either repairing or vacating and repairing said building, if such repair will
comply with the ordinances of this City, or may vacate and demolish said dangerous building
at his/her own risk to prevent the acquiring by the City of the lien against the land where the
dangerous building stands. If the evidence does not support a finding that a building or
structure is a dangerous building or a nuisance or detrimental to the health, safety or welfare
of the residents of the City, no order shall be issued.

If the owner, occupant, mortgagee or lessee fails to comply with the order within thirty (30)
days, the Director of Public Works shall cause such building or structure to be repaired,
vacated or demolished and the property cleaned up as the facts may warrant. If the Director
of Public Works or other designated officer or officers issues an order whereby the building or

performance shall be certified to the City Clerk or officer in charge of finance who shall cause
a special tax bill or assessment therefor against the property to be prepared and collected by
the City Collector or other official collecting taxes, unless the building or structure is
demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the City and
such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is
located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360,
RSMo. Except as provided in Section 510.280, at the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may
be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten (10) years. The tax bill from the
date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner and shall

any obligation under this Chapter.
The City shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds
received under Subsection (A)(1) of this Section to the insured or as the terms of the policy
and endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after receipt of such insurance

building or structure and the lot on which it is located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the
insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section, at
the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than
ten (10) years. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property and a
personal debt against the property owner(s) until paid.
This Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and
structures.
This Section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable
to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance
policy.
The Building Commissioner may certify that in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim
payment under Subsection (A) that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed

or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In
this event, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt of

one hundred twenty (120) consecutive hours, and shall authorize the service of alcoholic
beverages at such function, occasion or event during the hours at which alcoholic beverages may
lawfully be sold or served upon premises licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises
consumption. For every permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the permittee
shall pay to the City an amount as set out in Section 600.050(3)(c) above, or fraction thereof, for

children. The day care home operator should maintain a signed list of individuals approved to

As required by Section 67.2692, RSMo., this Subsection (D) shall be enforced only as follows:
Each video service provider shall implement an informal process for handling inquiries
from the City and customers concerning billing issues, service issues and other
complaints. If an issue is not resolved through this informal process, the City may request
a confidential non-binding mediation with the video service provider, with the costs of
such mediation to be shared equally between the City and the video service provider.
In the case of repeated, willful and material violations of the provisions of this Section by
a video service provider, the City may file a complaint on behalf of a resident harmed by
such violations with Missouri's Administrative Hearing Commission seeking an order
revoking the video service provider's Public Service Commission authorization. The City
or a video service provider may appeal any determination made by the Administrative
Hearing Commission under this Section to a court of competent jurisdiction which shall
have the power to review the decision de novo. The City shall not file a complaint seeking
revocation unless the video service provider has been given sixty (60) days' notice to
cure alleged breaches but has failed to do so.
Public, Educational And Government Access Programming.

franchisee as of August 28, 2007.
Any PEG channel that is not substantially utilized by the City may be reclaimed and
programmed by the video service provider at the provider's discretion. If the City finds and
certifies that a channel that has been reclaimed by a video service provider will be
substantially utilized, the video service provider shall restore the reclaimed channel within one
hundred twenty (120) days. A PEG channel shall be considered "substantially utilized" when
forty (40) hours per week are locally programmed on that channel for at least three (3)
consecutive months. In determining whether a PEG channel is substantially utilized, a
program may be counted not more than four (4) times during a calendar week.
The operation of any PEG access channel and the production of any programming that
appears on each such channel shall be the sole responsibility of the City or its duly appointed
agent receiving the benefit of such channel and the video service provider shall bear only the
responsibility for the transmission of the programming on each such channel to subscribers.
The City must deliver and submit to the video service provider all transmissions of PEG
content and programming in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and
transmitted by such video service provider holder over its network without further alteration or
change in the content or transmission signal. Such content and programming must be
compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the video service provider to deliver its
video services. The video service provider shall cooperate with the City to allow the City to
achieve such compatibility.
The City shall make the programming of any PEG access channel available to all video
service providers in a non-discriminatory manner. Each video service provider shall be
responsible for providing the connectivity to the City's or its duly appointed agent's PEG
access channel distribution points existing as of August 27, 2007. Where technically
necessary and feasible, video service providers shall use reasonable efforts and shall
negotiate in good faith to interconnect their video service networks on mutually acceptable
rates, terms and conditions for the purpose of transmitting PEG programming. A video service
provider shall have no obligation to provide such interconnection to a new video service
provider at more than one (1) point per headend, regardless of the number of political

shall be responsible for any costs associated with such interconnection, including signal
transmission from the origination point to the point of interconnection. Interconnection may be
accomplished by direct cable microwave link, satellite or other reasonable method of
connection acceptable to the person providing the interconnect.
The franchise obligation of an incumbent cable operator to provide monetary and other
support for PEG access facilities existing on August 27, 2007 shall continue until the date of
franchise expiration (ignoring any termination by notice of issuance of a video service
authorization) or January 1, 2012, whichever is earlier. Any other video service provider shall
have the same obligation to support PEG access facilities as the incumbent cable operator,
but if there is more than one (1) incumbent, then the incumbent with the most subscribers as
of August 27, 2007. Such obligation shall be prorated, depending on the nature of the
obligation, as provided in Section 67.2703.8, RSMo. The City shall notify each video service
provider of the amount of such fee on an annual basis, beginning one (1) year after issuance
of the video service authorization.
A video service provider may identify and pass through as a separate line item on
subscribers' bills the value of monetary and other PEG access support on a proportionate
basis.

Any person desiring to place facilities on private property must first apply for and obtain a
facilities permit, in addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise or
authorization required by law. The Director may design and make available standard forms for
such applications, requiring such information as allowed by law and as the Director
determines in his or her discretion to be necessary and consistent with the provisions of this
Chapter and to accomplish the purposes of this Chapter. Each application shall at minimum
contain the following information, unless otherwise waived by the Director:
The name of the person on whose behalf the facilities are to be installed and the name,
address and telephone number of a representative whom the City may notify or contact
at any time (i.e., twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week) concerning the
facilities;
A description of the proposed work, including a site plan and such plans or technical
drawings or depictions showing the nature, dimensions and description of the facilities,
their location and their proximity to other facilities that may be affected by their
installation.
Each such application shall be accompanied by an application fee approved by the City to
cover the cost of processing the application.
Application Review And Determination.
The Director shall promptly review each application and shall grant or deny the
application within thirty-one (31) days. Unless the application is denied pursuant to
subparagraph (d) hereof, the Director shall issue a facilities permit upon determining that
the applicant:
Has submitted all necessary information,
Has paid the appropriate fees, and
Is in full compliance with this Chapter and all other City ordinances.
The Director may establish procedures for bulk processing of
applications and periodic payment of fees to avoid excessive
processing and accounting costs.
It is the intention of the City that proposed facilities will not impair public safety, harm
property values or significant sight lines or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining
properties or neighborhood and that the placement and appearance of facilities on
private property should be minimized and limited in scope to the extent allowed by law to
achieve the purposes of this Section. To accomplish such purposes, all above ground
facilities, where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical and shall
not obstruct or interfere with water runoff or water drainage easements. If locating these
facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side
yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public right-of-way
unless otherwise approved by the Director upon a determination that all other alternatives
are not feasible.
An applicant receiving a facilities permit shall promptly notify the Director of any material
changes in the information submitted in the application or included in the permit. The
Director may issue a revised facilities permit or require that the applicant reapply for a
facilities permit.
The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in the public interest, for
the following reasons:
Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;

Failure to provide required information;
The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or other City
ordinances;
For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity as defined by applicable
Federal, State or local law;
For the applicant's refusal to comply with reasonable conditions required by the
Director; and
For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provided that
such denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service
Commission and is imposed on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis.
Permit revocation and ordinance violations.
The Director may revoke a facilities permit without fee refund after notice and an
opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and
conditions of the permit or this Chapter. Prior to revocation the Director shall provide
written notice to the responsible person identifying any substantial breach and allowing a
reasonable period of time not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure
period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety.
The cure period shall be extended by the Director on good cause shown. A substantial
breach includes, but is not limited to, the following:
A material violation of the facilities permit or this Chapter;
An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the permit or this Chapter
or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its
residents;
A material misrepresentation of fact in the permit application;
A failure to complete facilities installation by the date specified in the permit, unless
an extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons
beyond the applicant's control; and
A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as specified by
the Director, work that does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances,
industry construction standards or the City's pertinent and applicable ordinances,
including, but not limited to, this Chapter, provided that City standards are no more
stringent than those of a national safety ordinance.
Any breach of the terms and conditions of a facilities permit shall also be deemed a
violation of this Chapter and in lieu of revocation the Director may initiate prosecution of
the applicant or the facilities owner for such violation.
Facilities Regulations.
The following general regulations apply to the placement and appearance of facilities:
Facilities shall be placed underground, except when other similar facilities exist above
ground or when conditions are such that underground construction is impossible,
impractical or economically unfeasible, as determined by the City, and when in the City's
judgment the above ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where
the construction is proposed. Facilities shall not be located so as to interfere or be likely
to interfere with any public facilities or use of public property.

Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. Nonresidential
zoning districts are preferred to residential zoning districts. Preferred locations
in order of priority in both type districts are:
Thoroughfare landscape easements,
Rear yards, and
Street side yards on a corner lot behind the front yard setback. Placements within
side yards not bordered by a street or within front yards are discouraged.
Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective or metallic. Black, gray
and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Sightproof screening,
landscape or otherwise, may be required for facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or
covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to
reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of
landscaping materials shall be approved by the Director prior to installation of any facility
requiring landscape screening. The person responsible for the facilities shall be
responsible for the installation, repairs or replacement of screening materials. Alternative
concealment may be approved by the Director to the extent it meets or exceeds the
purposes of these requirements.
Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner and so as to not emit any
unnecessary or intrusive noise and in accordance with all applicable provisions of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code and all
other applicable Federal, State or local laws and regulations.
No person shall place or cause to be placed any sort of signs, advertisements or other
extraneous markings on the facilities, except such necessary minimal markings approved
by the City as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or
emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or
regulation.
If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for facilities to the extent that the
exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director shall
cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but the
City shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the
applicant.
Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing or operating facilities, and the person
on whose behalf the work is being done, shall protect from damage any and all existing
structures and property belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all rights-of-way,
public property or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or
replaced and the responsible person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of the
damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time
specified by the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
The applicant shall provide written notice to all property owners within one hundred eighty-five
(185) feet of the site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any installation, replacement or
expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be
done, the location of work and the time and duration of the work.
At the City's direction, a person owning or controlling facilities shall protect, support,
disconnect, relocate or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to
accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation or maintenance of streets
or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety or welfare.

If a person installs facilities without having complied with the requirements of this Chapter or
abandons the facilities, said person shall remove the facilities and if the person fails to
remove the facilities within a reasonable period of time, the City may, to the extent permitted
by law, have the removal done at the person's expense.
Facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as
part of the City Code including, but not limited to, building codes, zoning requirements and
rights- of-way management regulations in addition to the regulations provided herein.
Section 610.040. Penalty.
[Ord. No. 7473 §1, 12-11-2007]
Any person found guilty of violating any provision herein shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed ninety (90) days or by both such fine
and imprisonment and each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
