PERRYVILLE, MISSOURI MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Perryville, Missouri 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 14, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Perryville, Missouri Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Marilyn Dobbelare, city clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 14, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. Ordinance No. 6141 , passed April 16, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 14, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. __, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

He shall revise existing specifications as the need arises. 
    Department heads will notify the city administrator when they desire to establish a new position or to modify an existing one, and the city administrator will keep them informed of all classification changes. 
A.  When a new position is created or an existing position is changed by adding, modifying or taking away assignments, that position will be evaluated and properly classified. 
B.  The city administrator will make periodic reviews of all positions in a single department or of all the positions in a particular range. As a result of his study, he may submit to a job evaluation committee a recommendation to reevaluate individual positions; or he himself may recommend a reevaluation subject to the approval of the board of alderman. 
C.  An employee may submit to his department head a written request for reevaluation of his position. This request shall set forth reasons justifying reevaluation. The department head will study each request and forward it with his recommendations to the city administrator. The city administrator will study the position in question, revise the job specifications if necessary and submit his findings and recommendations in writing to the department head. Written notice of the final determination will be furnished to the employee within sixty (60) days of the request for reevaluation. 
D.  An employee who occupies a position which is reevaluated shall continue in that position in the new range only if he or she possesses the minimum requirements and is appointed in accordance with the rules governing transfer, promotion or demotion. 
1.  When a position is reevaluated to a lower range, the employee may continue in his position in the new range (see Section 2.88.550) or he or she may apply for transfer to a position in the original range. If the employee continues in his/her position in the new range, the employee shall receive no raise in pay until such time as the new range reaches his/her pay amount. 
2.  When a position is reevaluated to a higher range, the incumbent employee, if he or she has the minimum qualification, may continue in the position.

2.88.520 - Certification, license or education. 
    If the city administrator determines that a certification, license, or education is necessary or essential to provide better service to the city, then the city administrator may, with approval of the board of aldermen, establish a compensation schedule providing for compensation to employees who obtain the certification, license or education set forth in the schedule. 
(Ord. 4866 § 2 (part), 2007)

On the basis of this information, he shall recommend to the board of aldermen changes in pay policy or in individual pay rates necessary to keep the pay plan current, uniform and equitable.

(Ord. 4866 § 2 (part), 2007) 
2.88.530 - Pay increases.

B.  Eligibility for step increases within the classification grade of a position in the pay plan shall be based on the length of service of the employee; however, any employee who received an overall performance evaluation below successful shall not be eligible for a step increase. In such cases, the employee, the employee's supervisor, and the employee's department head shall set out a program designed to help the employee attain the successful level in the employee's evaluation. The employee shall reach the successful level in the employee's evaluation within six months or be subject to dismissal. If the employee reaches the successful level anytime within the six month period, the employee's step increase shall be restored. 
C.  Each January all supervisors shall complete an informal supplementary assessment of all employees under their supervision to determine if any employee is in jeopardy of falling below an overall evaluation score of successful. In such cases the employee shall receive a written employee evaluation and, for those scoring below successful, any cost of living adjustment (COLA) shall be withheld beginning in April of that year. At that same time, the employee, the employee's supervisor, and the employee's department head shall set out a program designed to help the employee attain the successful level in the employee's evaluation. The employee shall reach the successful level in the employee's evaluation within six months or be subject to dismissal. If the employee reaches the successful level anytime within the six month probation period, the employee's COLA shall be restored.

In such cases, the employee will be placed in the classification designated for the position, but the employee's starting pay will be at a lower level. Such starting pay will be determined by the department head and the city administrator on the basis of the employee's education and experience. An employee will be expected to be proficient in this position after a period of one hundred eighty (180) days and during that time is on probation. See Article 4 of this chapter.

All overtime will be at the rate of time and one-half of the regular hourly rate, except that overtime on Sundays and holidays will be at the rate of double time of the regular hourly rate. It is generally the policy of the city that employees work a forty (40) hour work week; therefore, compensatory time should be scheduled in the same week in which the overtime is worked. If overtime is necessary, the department head will determine if compensatory time will be used or overtime will be paid. 
B.  All nonexempt employees working within the police department will receive compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay as directed by the chief of police or will be paid at the overtime rate set forth in subsection A of this section except as specifically modified in this subsection, all at the discretion of the chief of police with the approval of the city administrator. All compensatory time will be computed at one and one-half times the overtime worked. (Example: An employee works one hour overtime, he or she receives compensatory time of one and one-half hours.) Nonexempt employees working within the police department shall not be entitled to double time for Sundays and holidays if those days are regularly scheduled duty. However, nonexempt employees working within the police department who are called out on Sundays and holidays that are not their regularly scheduled duty will receive compensatory time computed at double the time of overtime worked. 
C.  Nonexempt employees called back shall be paid the applicable overtime rate for the time worked with a minimum of two hours pay. A day off shall be considered to begin and end at the same time as a regular workday, and work continuing into a day off from a previous call back shall not be entitled to the two-hour premium. 
D.  Any employee who works overtime that has not been certified by a department head as necessary and approved by the city administrator may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 
E.  Nonexempt employees shall work overtime when necessary, and overtime on any job shall be allocated as evenly as possible among all nonexempt employees qualified to do the work.

Article 7. - Leave

(Ord. 4866 § 2 (part), 2007) 
2.88.705 - Family and Medical Leave Act (1993). 
A.  Purpose of Policy. To define city of Perryville's policy and procedure with regard to family and medical leave, in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
B.  Scope. This policy covers all employees of city of Perryville. 
C.  Policy and Procedures. 
1.  Eligibility. 
a.  Employees who have been employed as a full-time employee for at least twelve (12) months (continuous or noncontinuous), and have worked for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours in the twelve (12) month period preceding the start of the leave, shall be eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of leave (family and/or medical) in a twelve (12) month period. The twelve (12) month period is measured as a "rolling" twelve (12) month period; measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. Each time an employee takes FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the twelve (12) weeks which have not been used during the immediately preceding twelve (12) months. The following reasons qualify for FMLA leave: 
b.  i.  The birth of an employee's child and/or to care for the newborn child; 
ii.  The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care or any necessary activities related thereto; 
iii.  Where the employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent of the employee who has a serious health condition; and/or 
iv.  Inability of the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position due to a serious health condition of the employee, including prenatal care or the inability to work due to pregnancy. 
c.  Any employee requesting family and/or medical leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the city of Perryville time to determine whether the leave qualifies as FMLA leave. Only leave taken for the above conditions will count against the twelve (12) weeks of FMLA entitlement, so long as the employee is eligible. 
2.  Notice. 
a.  Where the need for family and/or medical leave is foreseeable, the employee must provide the city of Perryville with at least thirty (30) days' notice. If unforeseeable, as much notice as practicable should be given. If an employee fails to give thirty (30) days' notice for a medical or family leave that was clearly foreseeable, and the employee has no reasonable excuse for the delay, the city of Perryville may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the employee provides notice to the city. 
b.  Employees are expected to consult with their supervisor or department head prior to scheduling medical treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule that best suits the needs of both the city and the employee. Management may, for justifiable cause, require an employee to reschedule treatment subject to the availability and approval of the health care provider. The city will at no time render any medical opinion, but will rely on the opinion of the qualified health care professional as to the reasonableness of rescheduling. 
3.  Pregnancy, Related Medical Condition, or Placement of Child. 
a.  In some cases, leave for birth or placement for adoption or foster care can be taken prior to the actual birth or placement. 
b.  An employee's right to family and/or medical leave for the birth or placement expires at the end of the twelve (12) month period beginning on the date of birth or placement. Any leave must be concluded within this one year. 
4.  Serious Health Condition. 
a.  A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition involving: (i) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; (ii) any incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities of more than three calendar days that also involves continuing treatment by or under the supervision of a health care provider; (iii) continuing treatment by or under the supervision of a health care provider for a chronic or long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three calendar days; and (iv) prenatal care. 
(A)  Whenever more than three consecutive work days are missed due to qualified reasons as defined by the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, then this leave time shall be designated as FMLA leave. When more than three consecutive days are missed, the FMLA leave will be retroactive to the first day missed. 
b.  City of Perryville may require medical certification: form (http://dol.gov/esa/ regs/compliance/whd/fmla/wh380.pdf) where leave is sought to care for the serious health condition of child, spouse, parent, or due to a serious health condition of the employee. The employee must provide the requested certification within fifteen (15) days after the family or medical leave absence commences, or after the city requests the certification, whichever occurs first unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent good-faith efforts. If an employee does not provide timely certification within fifteen (15) days, and the leave was foreseeable, city of Perryville may deny leave until the required certification is provided. If the leave was unforeseeable, the employee must try to provide the certification as soon as practicable and may be denied continuance of leave if the medical certification is not provided within a reasonable time. 
i.  The medical certification form sets forth the date the serious health condition commenced, the nature of the condition, and the probable duration of the condition. When an employee takes leave for his own medical condition, city of Perryville will require that the certification state that the employee is unable to perform his or her essential job functions. If needed, city of Perryville will provide a statement of the essential functions of the employee's position for the health care provider to review. 
ii.  When the leave is taken to care for a family member, city of Perryville will require a statement from a health care provider that the employee is needed to care for the family member and an estimate of the time required for that care. 
iii.  In its discretion and at its own expense, city of Perryville may request that a second medical opinion be secured from a health care provider. If the second opinion differs from the first opinion, city of Perryville reserves the right to require a third opinion at city of Perryville's expense. The third opinion will be provided by a health care provider approved jointly by the city and the employee. This third opinion will be final and binding. Subsequent medical re-certification may also be required by city of Perryville if the city has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration or whenever circumstances described by the original certification have changed significantly. 
c.  Employees may take twelve (12) weeks worth of leave on an intermittent or reduced work week basis for a serious health condition of the child, spouse, or parent of the employee or the employee, but such leave will be allowed only if medically necessary, and medical need can be best accommodated through an intermittent leave or reduced work schedule. The same requirements for medical certification apply for intermittent or reduced work week leave. The statement from a health care provider must state that the employee is needed to care for the family member and the reasons why intermittent or reduced work week leave can best accommodate the medical need. Intermittent leave may occur where the family member's condition itself is intermittent, or the employee is only needed intermittently. Examples of intermittent leave would include leave taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments or leave taken several days at a time. 
i.  The city of Perryville reserves the option to transfer the employee temporarily to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position. The alternative position will have equivalent pay and benefits. 
ii.  The employee must attempt to work out a schedule that meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the city's operations. 
5.  Benefits. 
a.  An employee on family and/or medical leave will be required to use all accrued paid time off, in the order designated by the employee, for any circumstances for which they may be eligible for FMLA leave. This paid leave shall run concurrently with FMLA leave. Employees utilizing paid time off in conjunction with FMLA leave will continue to accrue paid time off during the leave and will receive any holiday pay. After the employee has exhausted all paid days off, the remainder of the leave will be unpaid. 
b.  The personnel clerk will inform the employee, prior to the leave, whether it considers the leave to qualify for FMLA leave and what portion, if any, will be paid leave. (See form http://www.dol.gov/esa/forms/whd/wh-381.pdf, "Employer Response to Employee Request for FMLA.") In cases where notification to the city occurs after the absence has begun, the city will communicate this information as soon as possible. 
c.  Group health coverage will be maintained until the end of the FMLA leave of absence, or for twelve (12) weeks, whichever is shorter. During the duration of an employee's leave, coverage by the health plan will remain at the level the coverage would be if the employee were still on the job. An employee who wishes to maintain dependent group health coverage during the leave must continue to pay the employee's portion of the premium for coverage, if any, that he or she paid prior to the FMLA leave. If an employee chooses to retain coverage during FMLA leave, the employee, upon reinstatement, will be entitled to the same terms as prior to taking the leave. 
i.  If allowable, the employee must notify the city of any change in coverage desired during leave. The employee will also be notified of any opportunity to change plans or benefits. The employee will bear all additional costs that would have been incurred by the employee had he or she been on the job. If premiums are raised during the time an employee is on leave, the employee will be required to pay the additional premium rates that would have been incurred while on the job. Also, the employee will be subject to new or changed plan benefits to the same extent as if the employee were not on leave. 
ii.  During paid leave, if any, premiums will be made by payroll deduction. During unpaid leave, the employee is to send the premium payment to the personnel clerk on the date on which the payroll deduction would normally be made for the premium. No additional charges will be added. Health insurance coverage will cease if an employee's premium payment is more than thirty (30) days late. If coverage lapses because an employee has not made the required premium payment, if allowable the employee will be restored to the previous coverage upon return from leave without incurring a waiting period. 
iii.  In the event that an employee fails to return to work upon completion of an approved family or medical leave for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition, or other circumstances beyond the employee's control, the employee must reimburse the city for the cost of any premium payments made by the city to maintain the employee's group health coverage while the employee was on leave. This does not include premiums for a period of FMLA leave covered by paid leave where premium payments were deducted from payroll checks. If and when the employee informs the city of his or her intent not to return to work, the right to health benefit privileges ends (except for COBRA privileges). Where feasible, city of Perryville will recover its share of health insurance premiums through deduction of any sums due to the employee. The city's payment of the employee's portion of any other benefits, such as life insurance will be recovered from the employee whether or not the employee returns from leave. 
iv.  If the employee fails to return due to the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition, the city may require medical certification of the employee's or family member's serious condition. The employee is required to provide the medical certification within thirty (30) days from the date of the city's request. If the city requests the medical certification and the employee does not provide such certification within thirty (30) days, the city can recover the health benefit premiums it paid during the period of leave. An employee who returns to work for less than thirty (30) days is not considered to have "returned" to work. 
6.  Return from Leave. 
a.  Any employee on FMLA leave must periodically, but at least every thirty (30) days, report to their immediate supervisor on his or her status and intent to return to work. 
b.  Employees returning from leave under this subsection will be allowed to return to their same or equivalent position upon completion of the authorized leave, assuming the employee would otherwise have been employed in that position at the time reinstatement is requested. If an employee is no longer qualified for the position because of lack of training, testing, etc., the employee will be given a reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon return to work. An employee will be able to receive any unconditional pay increases that may have occurred during the leave period. 
c.  Any employee wishing to return from leave must obtain and present certification from a qualified health care provider that the employee is able to resume work. This fitness-for-duty certification should only address the particular health condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The certification must state whether the employee is able to return to work and perform the essential functions of his or her job as well as clearly identify any medical restrictions. 
d.  If leave was due to a serious health condition of the employee, Work STEPS fit-for-duty testing will be required prior to returning to work on a full-duty status. The Work STEPS policy is on file at City Hall. 
e.  Employees who fail to report to work when released to do so by their physician, who fail to accept an available position upon release by their physician, or do not return to work for any reason within twelve (12) weeks after going on family or medical leave of absence, or their date of release whichever is sooner, lose their right to reinstatement and employment will be terminated. 
f.  Should an employee fail to return to work at the end of their FMLA leave, retirement benefits shall be based on the last day worked or of paid time off taken by employee. 
g.  In the event a health care provider's restrictions prevent an employee from performing the essential functions of his or her original position, the employee will be assigned to an available equivalent position with essential functions the employee can perform where possible. If no such positions are available, the employee may, at the city's discretion, remain on an extended medical leave of absence for as long as feasible. If the city administrator determines it is in the city's best interest, the employment may be terminated. 
7.  General. 
a.  A husband and wife both working for the city of Perryville are each entitled to the full twelve (12) week allotment of leave for their own health condition or because of the serious health condition of their spouse, son, or daughter. However, if the leave is used for the birth of a child, adoption of a child, or to care for a sick parent, the combination of husband and wife is entitled to twelve (12) weeks of leave. 
b.  Any employee who fraudulently obtains leave under this policy will be immediately terminated. 
c.  Where the cause of a serious health condition initially occurred as a result of a work-related injury or illness covered by workers compensation law, such time off as it applies to work-related illness or injury shall not be counted as family medical leave. 
d.  Step increase dates and annual across-the-board increases shall not be affected by an employee utilizing FMLA leave. 
8.  Responsibilities. In addition to the obligations of the city and the employee outlined above, all managers, supervisors, and human resources representatives of the city of Perryville are responsible for ensuring that FMLA absences are administered in accordance with this policy. Proper collection and retention of applicable documents is required. Data and documents with regard to family and medical leaves will be kept in accordance with all applicable HIPAA requirements. Supervisor and department heads, along with the personnel clerk are to ensure that state specific regulations are taken into account when making leave of absence decisions. 
9.  Complaints. If an employee believes their rights under FMLA have been violated, the employee has the choice of: 
a.  Filing, or having another person file on his or her behalf, a complaint with the Secretary of Labor; or 
b.  Filing a private lawsuit pursuant to Section 107 of FMLA.eol;

A.  Employee Choices. The employee may choose to be: (1) compensated by the city's workers compensation plan at loss of time benefit rate; or (2) compensated by the city's workers compensation plan at loss of time benefit rate and use a portion of their accrued sick, personal, and vacation time (in that order) at their normal rate of pay. 
B.  Accrual of Benefits. The employee will continue to accrue their benefits while on worker's compensation leave. 
C.  Doctor Visits. Once an employee has returned to work, any follow-up worker's compensation doctor visits will not be charged against their accrued time.

2.88.730 - Military leave. 
    The city of Perryville complies with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 with regard to employees serving in the armed forces.

The employee may utilize accrued vacation pay during the leave, at his/her discretion. Upon termination of such service, the employee will be returned to the position he/she would have held had the interruption in employment not occurred. Vacancies resulting from leave granted under this section shall be filled only on a temporary basis. One voluntary enlistment shall be considered the same as induction for the purpose of this section, but reenlistment shall not. 
    "Service in the uniformed services" means the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority.

B.  Employees may be evaluated annually, or more frequently as necessary, by their department head or designated supervisor as set forth in Section 2.88.530. 
C.  The city utilizes the following progressive approach to disciplinary actions: 
1.  Coaching. When work habits, attitude, production, or personal conduct of an employee falls below desirable standards, supervisors should point out the deficiencies at the time they are observed. 
2.  Verbal. If an employee fails to correct the deficiencies, the supervisor will provide a documented verbal warning indicating to the employee that this verbal warning is intended to correct the deficiencies within a specific timeline before a written warning must be issued. 
3.  Written. If an employee fails to correct the deficiencies after the verbal warning, the supervisor will provide a written warning, including steps for the employee to improve behavior and a timeline for reassessment to ensure improvement. 
4.  Suspension/Probation. If the first written warning does not produce improvement, then the supervisor will provide a second warning, which may include a disciplinary suspension without pay and corrective probation, informing the employee that failure to improve may result in discharge. 
    A written warning and sufficient time for improvement should typically precede formal discipline, but nothing in this section shall prevent an immediate formal action whenever the interest of the city requires it. The employee shall be given a copy of the warnings issued to the employee and a copy provided to the employee's personnel file.

All residential users within the city shall pay a monthly garbage and solid waste collection fee as established by the board of aldermen and on file with the city clerk. Residential users electing to utilize two city-issued trash carts for their weekly refuse service shall pay a one-time non-refundable cost of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a monthly garbage and solid waste collection fee in the same monthly amount as the commercial single collection fee. 
C.  Commercial Single Collection Fee. All commercial users within the city whose garbage and solid waste generation requires no more than weekly pickup shall pay a monthly garbage and solid waste collection fee as established by the board of aldermen and on file with the city clerk. Commercial users electing to utilize two city-issued trash carts for their weekly refuse service shall pay a one-time non-refundable cost of fifty dollars ($50.00).

Fees for unoccupied units shall be commenced automatically upon the renewed occupancy thereof. 
G.  Joint Residential and Commercial. Given the limited volume of garbage and solid waste residential-based businesses typically generate, a property that is used jointly for residential and commercial purposes shall be billed at the residential rate. The city reserves the right to review garbage and solid waste usage for joint residential and commercial property. In the event the usage exceeds normal or expected residential amounts, then the city may charge for garbage and solid waste service at the commercial rate. This decision shall be made by the city administrator only after a thorough, longitudinal review and not based on single or sporadic incidents. 
H.  Automatic Cost of Living Garbage and Solid Waste Collection Fee Adjustment. The rates for subsections B, C, D, and E of this section shall be adjusted yearly and shall be effective on April 1 of each year.

The modified garbage and solid waste collection fee schedule shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk for inspection by the public. 
I.  Voluntary Curbside Recycling Fees. Each year the Perry County Commission shall advise the board of aldermen of the amount of money needed to be collected from each user of the voluntary curbside recycling service in order to cover recycling expenses.

8.16.110 - Garbage and solid waste collection provisions. 
A.  Garbage and solid waste collection fees shall be terminated upon presentation of satisfactory proof to the city administrator or his designee that any premises are unoccupied and the fees shall be commenced automatically upon renewed occupancy thereof. 
B.  The system of services established by the provisions of this chapter is designed as an integral part of the city's program of health and sanitation to be operated as an adjunct to the city's system for providing potable water and the city's system for providing sewerage disposal. The city may enforce collection of such charges by bringing legal action against the property owner or the occupant of any premises which has received such services to recover any sums due for such services plus a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court. 
C.  The fees herein provided for are imposed on a per unit basis upon the premises receiving such services under the provisions of this chapter. The billing therefor shall be made to the person contracting for city services. Fees shall be payable to the department empowered to collect fees imposed by the city. 
D.  A residential complex of more than three units or a commercial user may apply to the city for a collection exclusion. A collection exclusion may be granted upon the presentation of satisfactory proof to the city administrator or his designee that the owner or occupant of the premises has contracted with a dumpster or major receptacle collection system provider. Such collection exclusion may be granted for dumpster or major receptacle collection systems only and will not be considered for off-site disposal or private collection done on a similar basis as city collection. A collection exclusion for any user shall prohibit any city garbage and solid waste collection to that user including, but not limited to, limbs or debris. The collection exclusion will only be granted if it provides for safe and sanitary collection of garbage and solid waste for the benefit of the health and welfare of the citizens of the city. In the event that the city administrator or his designee determines that a system of collection does not provide for the health and welfare of the citizens of the city, then any collection exclusion previously granted may be revoked and city collection and fees automatically reinstated. 
E.  The city may, in its sole discretion, terminate commercial users whose amount of garbage and solid waste regularly exceeds the city's reasonable capacity to pick up or whose logistical or physical arrangement is not conducive to safe and efficient collection by the city. This decision shall be made by the city administrator only after a thorough, longitudinal review and not based on single or sporadic incidents. Upon termination, those users shall be required to contract with a dumpster or major receptacle collection system provider. 
F.  Residential customers whose amount of garbage and solid waste regularly exceeds the volume of a city-issued trash cart will be contacted by public works staff. At that time users may voluntarily upgrade to two carts as described in Section 8.16.100, subsection B, or otherwise reduce their volume accordingly. 
G.  Collection fees will be charged as a flat fee per collection period and shall not be prorated for a partial period.

Items of large solid waste shall be limited to and defined as bulk items, including furniture, washing machines, clothes dryers, residential stoves and ranges, water heaters, refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, air conditioners, furnaces, or other large appliances that would normally be found in a residential setting. Prior to the collection of any bulk item under this subsection, the property owner shall pay a ten dollar ($10.00) collection fee to the city. Televisions and computer monitors may be collected curbside provided the property owner shall prepay to the city the proper fee as established by the Perry County Recycling Center or may be delivered by the property owner to the Perry County Recycling Center in accordance with established fees. 
B.  Spring and Fall Cleaning. The city shall offer its residential customers large trash service two times per year at no additional charge. These pickups shall occur during the second full week of both April and October. This shall not include items listed as bulk or electronic in Section 8.16.060(K) or Section 8.16.130(A) except that furniture will be allowed for pickup during the spring and fall cleaning. Individual large volumes of trash pickups may be scheduled outside of those times with public works for a prepaid fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Prepayment of this fee shall be required for all individual pickups estimated to be larger than four hundred (400) cubic gallons. 
C.  Commercial and Industrial Excluded. Nothing in this section shall be construed to provide for the collection of any large item of solid waste from a commercial or industrial site and shall apply exclusively to residential collections.

Chapter 8.20 - NUISANCES 
Sections: 

8.20.010 - Purpose and findings. 
    The mayor and board of aldermen of the city find that unkept, unsafe, unsanitary and otherwise improperly maintained premises and structures, sidewalks and easements within the city, in addition to the obvious hazards which these conditions pose to the public health, safety and welfare adversely affect the value, utility and habitability of property within the city as a whole and specifically cause substantial damage to adjoining and nearby property. A property which is merely unkept may reduce the value of adjoining property by more than thirty (30) percent and a significant number of properties which are unkept, unsightly and dangerous may materially affect the habitability and economic well-being of the overall city. This chapter conveys to the city administration, in accordance with the procedures set out below, all necessary and proper powers to abate nuisances and other improperly maintained structures and properties as they are described or found to exist and to charge the costs of their abatement to those responsible, the owners and occupants of the property upon which nuisances exist, and those properties themselves. This chapter is an exercise of the city's police power and it shall be liberally construed to effect this purpose.

8.20.045 - Access to property. 
    The director may make or cause to be made inspections to determine the conditions of all structures and premises governed by this title in order to safeguard the safety, health, and welfare of the public under the provisions of this chapter. The director is authorized to enter any structure or premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of assuring compliance with this chapter after seeking consent from the owner, occupant, or operator. The owner, occupant, or operator of every structure or premises governed by this chapter, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the director access thereto and to all parts thereof and to the premises on which it is located at all reasonable times for the purpose of such inspection. In the event the owner, occupant, or operator is unavailable to give consent or shall refuse to give consent for access to any structure or premises, the director or other enforcement official may make application to the judge of the municipal court for a search warrant. The application for said search warrant shall clearly state the following: 
A.  That the application is made by an enforcement official who is the director, a police officer, code enforcement officer, building inspector, or attorney working for the city on said matter. 
B.  That the application is supported by an affidavit of probable cause detailing the actual or suspected property conditions that justify entry. 
C.  That the application is supported by a statement that entry was requested to the property and that the owner, occupant, or operator was unavailable or refused such entry. 
    If the municipal judge finds that the facts establish probable cause to believe that a code violation exists and that the application is true and correct, the municipal judge will sign a warrant and authorize the requested entry.

(Ord. No. 5278, § 1, 11-15-11) 
8.20.050 - Unfit buildings generally. 
A.  Determination of Building Fitness. In reaching a judgment that a building is unfit for human habitation, the director shall consider: 
1.  Dilapidation; 
2.  Disrepair; 
3.  Structural defects; 
4.  Defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities, such as parts standing or attached in such a manner as to be likely to fall and cause damage or injury; 
5.  Inadequate ventilation; 
6.  Uncleanliness; 
7.  Inadequate light; 
8.  Inadequate sanitary facilities; 
9.  Inadequate drainage; 
10.  Substandard conditions. 
If these or other conditions are found to exist to an extent dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the building's occupants, or the occupants of neighboring buildings or of other residents of the city, and if: 
a.  Structural deterioration is of such a degree that: (i) vertical members list, lean or buckle to the extent that a plumb line passing through the center of gravity falls outside the middle third of its base; or (ii) thirty-three (33) percent of the supporting members shows damage or deterioration; or 
b.  The cost of restoration exceeds sixty-six (66) percent of the value of the building; or 
c.  The building has been damaged by fire or other calamity, the cost of restoration exceeds thirty-three (33) percent of the value of the building, and it has remained vacant for six months or more (Value shall be determined by reference to the assessed valuation as determined by the Perry County, Missouri, assessor and by reference to such other data as may be determined by the board of aldermen. Cost of restoration is the actual estimated cost, which may be determined in the same manner as "value."); 
the director shall declare the building a public nuisance and order the abatement of the nuisance in compliance with Sections 8.20.070 through 8.20.100. 
B.  Restoration or Repair. An undertaking by a party in interest to restore or repair an unfit building, entered into at or prior to the determination of building fitness by the director, creates a presumption that the building or premises can be reasonably repaired. The director may then grant additional time in accordance with Section 8.20.110(E). The failure to accomplish such an undertaking is grounds for the building inspector to order demolition. If by reason of any of the above conditions is unfit, but no public necessity is found for its immediate demolition, the building inspector may take other action, such as causing the property to be cleaned, cleared, vacated, secured or otherwise repaired, which will promote the public health, safety or general welfare.

A.  Substandard Criteria. In reaching a judgment that a building or premises is substandard, the building inspector shall be guided by such factors as: 
1.  Structural soundness; 
2.  Improper sanitation; 
3.  Improper safety; 
4.  Improper weatherproofing; 
5.  Defective or hazardous wiring, including wiring which:

b.  Has not been maintained in good condition, or 
c.  Is not being used in a safe manner;

9.  Nuisance. 
B.  Remedial Action. If these or similar conditions are found to exist, the building inspector shall declare the building a public nuisance and order the building or premises repaired, cleaned, cleared or otherwise brought into compliance with current city codes or ordinances, and may order the property vacated and secured as completely as possible pending such repair or other action. 
(Ord. 3667 § 1 (part), 1998: prior code § 20-3(3.5))

8.20.080 - Summary abatement of nuisances. 
A.  Procedure. 
1.  Complaint. All complaints alleging the existence of a nuisance shall be made to the director. Any resident, including any city elected official, officer or employee, may initiate a complaint. 
2.  Inspection. The director shall promptly inspect the premises or cause them to be inspected and shall make a written report of the findings of the inspection. Whenever practical, photographs of the premises shall be attached to the written report. The director shall keep all such written reports on file for at least three years. 
3.  Abatement. Upon the discovery of a public nuisance, the inspecting officer may order the owner or other person creating, keeping, maintaining or permitting the same to abate it. 
4.  Immediate Danger-Existence. Should the inspecting officer find that a public nuisance exists, and that the public health, welfare or safety may be in immediate danger, then summary abatement procedures shall be implemented and the inspecting official or department may cause the nuisance to be removed or abated.

(Ord. 3667 § 1 (part), 1998: prior code § 20-4(4.3)) 
(Ord. No. 5834, § 13, 1-10-17) 
8.20.090 - Abatement of nuisances in other cases. 
A.  Procedure. Upon the discovery of a public nuisance that does not pose an immediate danger to the public health, welfare or safety, the director shall cause a written report of the property on which the nuisance exists to be prepared. Photographs and findings shall be included in the report. If the director declares the existence of a public nuisance, but the nature thereof is not such as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, then the director may order the abatement of the nuisance by notice in compliance with Section 8.20.100. 
B.  Abatement by Owner. Within ten days after the posting or personal service or mailing of a notice to abate a nuisance, the owner, or individual in possession of the affected property, shall remove and abate such nuisance or show that the actions for abating the nuisance have commenced. Such showing shall be made by filing a written statement or other proof of such actions with the director. 
C.  Abatement by City. If, after a hearing in compliance with this chapter, it is found that the nuisance or dangerous condition exists, the director shall have the authority to enter upon the property and abate the public nuisance found thereon. In abating such nuisance, the director may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete the abatement of the public nuisance. If it is practicable to salvage any material derived in the aforesaid abatement, the director may sell the salvaged material at private or public sale and shall keep an accounting of the proceeds thereof. 
D.  Proceeds From Sale of Private Property. The proceeds, if any, obtained from the sale of any material salvaged as a result of an abatement of a public nuisance by the director shall be deposited to the general fund of the city and deficit between the amount so received and the cost of the abatement shall be filed with the city clerk. The city clerk shall certify the costs and assess costs to the annual real estate tax bill for the property. Should the proceeds of the sale of the salvaged material exceed the cost of the abatement, the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the owner of the property from which the public nuisance was abated when a proper claim to the excess if established. 
E.  Authorized Action. In abating a public nuisance, the director may call upon any of the city departments or divisions for whatever assistance shall be deemed necessary or may by private contract cause the abatement of the public nuisance. 
F.  Statement of Costs. The director shall, after completing the removal and abatement, file a statement of costs with the city clerk. The city clerk shall certify costs and assign costs to the annual real estate tax bill for the property. 
G.  Prior Recovery. The city may seek to recover the cost of demolition prior to the occurrence of demolition. Upon issuance of an order by the director whereby the building or structure is ordered to be demolished, secured or repaired, then the building inspector may solicit no less than two independent bids for such demolition work. The amount of the lowest bid, including offset for salvage value, if any, plus reasonable anticipated costs of collection, including attorneys' fees, shall be certified to the city clerk who shall cause a special tax bill to be issued against the property owner to be prepared and collected by the city clerk. The city clerk shall discharge the special tax bill upon documentation by the property owner of the completion of the ordered repair or demolition work. Upon determination by the city clerk that a public benefit is secured prior to payment of the special tax bill, the city clerk may discharge the special tax bill upon the transfer of the property. The payment of the special tax bill shall be held in an interest-bearing account. Upon full payment of the special tax bill, the director shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter, cause the ordered work to be completed, and certify the actual cost thereof, including the cost of tax bill collection and attorneys' fees, to the city clerk who shall, if the actual cost differs from the paid amount by greater than two percent of the paid amount, refund the excess payment, if any, to the payor, or, if the actual amount is greater, cause a special tax bill or assessment for the difference against the property to be prepared and collected by the city clerk. If the director shall not, within one hundred twenty (120) days after full payment, cause the ordered work to be completed, then the full amount of the payment, plus interest, shall be repaid to the payor. At the request of the taxpayer the tax bill for the difference may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten years. The tax bill for the difference from the date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner and shall also be a lien on the property until paid. 
(Ord. 3667 § 1 (part), 1998: prior code § 20-4(4.4-4.9); Ord. No. 5748, § 24, 4-19-16; Ord. No. 5834, § 14, 1-10-17) 
8.20.100 - Notice. 
A.  Service of Notice. The director shall determine all individuals, firms or corporations who, from the records in the recorder of deeds' office, appear to be the titled owners, occupants, lessees, mortgagees, agents and all other persons having an interest in a building or structure as shown by said land records of the aforesaid property and immediately cause a written notice to be served on each such individual, firm or corporation by personal service or by one of the following methods: 
1.  Leaving a copy of the notice at the usual place of residence or business of such owner or address of such owner shown in the recorder's records; or 
2.  Mailing a copy of the notice to such owner or occupant at such place and address by first class mail. 
In addition, the director shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the property which is in violation of this chapter. In the event that the owner of the property claims that the notice was not received under subparagraphs 1 or 2 above, the posting of the notice shall be deemed sufficient notice to the owner. 
B.  Notice Contents. The aforesaid notice to the owners and lienholder, if any, of the property shall state clearly and concisely: 
1.  The street address or legal description of the property; 
2.  A description of the condition or conditions alleged to constitute a public nuisance, what action will remedy the nuisance, and ordering the owner to abate the nuisance. 
3.  That the director shall cause a hearing to be scheduled before the city administrator or his designate not sooner than ten (10) days from the date of personal service or the posting on the property of the notice above referenced; 
4.  That the hearing shall be held and commencement of abatement action by the owner will not stay or delay the scheduled hearing. No continuances shall be granted; 
5.  That the failure of the owner, lienholder, occupant or representative to appear at the scheduled hearing shall be deemed a dismissal of the appeal and the prior decision of the director shall be final. 
C.  Adequacy of Proof. The director shall have discretion over what actions are sufficient to constitute the commencement of nuisance abatement. However, the building inspector shall be guided by such factors as: 
1.  Expedient and continuous work; 
2.  Abatement costs; and 
3.  Impact on environment or public. 
D.  Responsible Parties. Any person who is the record owner of the premises, location or structure at the time an order pursuant to this chapter is issued and served upon him shall be responsible for complying with that order and liable for any costs incurred by the city therewith, notwithstanding the fact that he conveys his interests in the property to another after such order was issued and served. 
(Ord. 3667 § 1 (part), 1998: prior code § 20-5; Ord. No. 5048, § 2, 9-3-09; Ord. No. 5834, §§ 15, 16, 1-10-17)

B.  Hearing. The city administrator shall conduct a full and adequate hearing upon the question of whether a public nuisance in fact exists. The city administrator may amend or modify the notice, or extend the times for compliance with the notice by the owner by such date as the city administrator in the course of the hearing may determine. 
C.  Evidence. The owners, lien holder and occupants of the property, or their representative or agents, of the subject property shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the city administrator in the course of the hearing. 
D.  Order. Should the evidence support a finding that the building, structure or condition constitutes a public nuisance, the city administrator shall issue an order making specific finds of fact, based upon competent and substantial evidence, which shows the building, structure or condition to be a public nuisance and ordering the building, structure or condition demolished, removed, repaired or otherwise abated by the city. 
E.  Additional Time. The city administrator, upon written application by the owner at any time within the period after the notice has been served may grant additional time for the owner to effect the abatement of the public nuisance, provided that such extension is limited to a specific time period. 
F.  Costs to be Certified. The costs of performance of the abatement order shall be certified to the city clerk who shall cause a special tax bill or assessment therefor against the property to be prepared and collected by the city clerk. If the building or structure is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to the order issued by the city administrator, such contractor may file a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided by Missouri state law. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, at the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten years. The tax bill from date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owners and shall also be a lien on the property until paid. 
G.  Appeal From Decision of City Administrator. If the decision of the city administrator is not appealed to the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days of the date of the mailing of the decision, the decision shall be declared final in accordance with Chapter 536 RSMo. 
(Ord. 3667 § 1 (part), 1998: prior code § 20-6) 
(Ord. No. 5748, § 25, 4-19-16) 
8.20.120 - Notice and appeal of assessments. 
A.  Procedure. Upon receipt of the statement of costs from the director, the city clerk shall mail to the owners of the property upon which the public nuisance has been abated notice of the amounts set forth in the statement plus an additional amount sufficient to defray the costs of the notice and stating that the city proposed to assess against the property the amount set forth in the notice and that objections to the proposed assessment must be made in writing and received by the city clerk within twenty (20) days from the date of mailing such notice. Upon the expiration of the twenty (20) day period, if no objections have been received by the city clerk, the city clerk shall enter that amount in the city liens docket which shall therefore constitute a lien against the property. 
B.  Objection. If the property owner or his representative objects to determination of cost, he may appeal same to the city administrator by delivering a written notice of appeal to the city administrator within twenty (20) days of the mailing of the notice thereof. If no appeal is taken or perfected, the initial determination of costs shall be final. 
C.  Absence of Appeal. If no appeal of a determination by the director is filed within the time period allowed, a copy of the determination will be furnished to the city clerk who shall then enter a lien in the amount determined by the building inspector in the city liens docket as provided by in subsection A of this section. 
D.  Filing of Appeal. If a timely appeal is received by the city administrator, a hearing shall be scheduled and held on the matter. If, after the hearing, the city administrator determines that the proposed assessment is improper, the city administrator shall so certify to the city clerk and the proposed assessment shall be canceled. If, after the hearing, it is determined that the proposed assessment or any part of it is proper and authorized, the city administrator shall so certify to the city clerk who shall enter a lien in such amount as determined appropriate by the city administrator. 
E.  Finality of Administrator's Decision. If the judgment of the city administrator is not appealed to the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days from the date of the city council's determination of the assessment, the judgment will be declared final per Missouri Revised Statutes Chapter 536. F. Cost of Abatement-Assessments. If the director determines or believes that there is good cause to reduce or adjust the cost of abatement, he may do so with the written approval of the city administrator. 
G.  Overhead Charge-Civil Penalties. 
1.  Whenever a nuisance is abated by the city, the city clerk shall keep an accurate account of all expenses incurred, including an overhead charge of twenty-five (25) percent for administration and a civil penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each nuisance abated. 
2.  When the city has abated a nuisance maintained by any owner of real property, for each subsequent nuisance that is abated by the city within two consecutive calendar years concerning real property, owned by the same person, an additional civil penalty of fifty (50) percent, minimum of one hundred dollars ($100.00), of the cost of abatement shall be added to the costs, charges and civil penalties provided for in Section 1.16.010. The civil penalty shall be imposed without regard to whether the nuisances abated by the city involve the same real property or are of the same character. 
H.  Nonexclusive Remedy. The procedures and remedies set forth in this article may be used in the alternative or in consonance with or in lieu of any other remedy or procedure authorized by law for the removal of violations or nuisances.

If the notice is sent by first class mail, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the notice was delivered three days after the date it was sent. If the name or address of the owner or the owner's agent is unknown or if the mail is returned, then service shall be made by posting such notice on the property. 
A.  The notice shall generally describe the nature of the nuisance, what action will remedy the nuisance, the location of the property (using the mailing or popular address rather than a legal description when reasonably possible to do so), and ordering the property owner to, within a period of ten days from the receipt of the notice or after posting of the notice on the property, abate the nuisance. 
B.  Any owner who wishes to challenge the order of abatement may do so provided that within the ten-day period said owner requests a hearing on the validity of the order under the appeal provision set out in Article 1 of this chapter.

If such request is made, the hearing shall be conducted by the city administrator.

If the director causes such condition to be removed or abated, the cost of such removal or abatement and the proof of notice to the owner of the property shall be certified to the city clerk who shall cause the certified cost to be included in a special tax bill or added to the annual real estate tax bill for the property at the option of the city clerk. The certified cost shall be collected by the county collector or other official collecting taxes in the same manner and procedure for collecting real estate taxes. If the certified cost is not paid, the tax bill shall be considered delinquent and the collection of the delinquent tax bill shall be governed by the laws governing delinquent and back taxes. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the owner and shall be a lien on the property from the date the tax bill is delinquent until paid.

Chapter 9.16 - GRAFFITI 
Sections: 

9.16.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    Graffiti on public and private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such malicious vandalism, but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties, and in so doing, negatively impacts upon the entire community. The city has in the past undertaken to remove graffiti from public property but has been unable to mount a successful program for encouraging the owners of private property to undertake to remove graffiti and other inscribed materials from walls, structures, etc. The legislation of the state of Missouri has authorized the city to define, regulate, suppress and prevent nuisance and to declare what shall constitute a nuisance and to abate and remove the same. 
(Prior code § 17-60) 
9.16.020 - Legislative determination. 
A.  The board of aldermen finds and determines that graffiti is a nuisance and unless it and other inscribed material is removed from public and private properties, it tends to remain; and other properties are then in the target of the graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods and indeed the community is depreciated in value and made a less desirable place to be. The board of aldermen therefore determines that it is appropriate that the city develop procedures to implement an ordinance and to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed material from both public and private property under the circumstances set forth hereinafter. 
B.  The board of aldermen declares as a matter of legislative determination that: 
1.  The increasing incidents of the defacement of public and private property through the application of graffiti upon walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, other structures, trees and other real and personal property within the corporate boundaries of the city constitutes a blight on this community, and, in the interests of the health, safety and general welfare of the residents and taxpayers of the city, immediate steps must be taken to remove this blight; 
2.  When appropriate, the courts should require those who commit acts of defacement of public or private property through the application of graffiti to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed; 
3.  Obtaining convictions for the application of graffiti is difficult to the fact that the offense can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the act are frequently nonexistent; 
4.  The schools should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting to the proper authorities the incidents of the application of graffiti which thereof observe. 
(Prior code § 17-61) 
9.16.030 - Definitions. 
    Whenever the following terms are used in this chapter, they shall have the meaning established by this section: 
    "Graffiti" means the defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public and private buildings, structures, and places. 
    "Graffiti abatement procedure" means an abatement procedure which identifies graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in absence of response. 
    "Private contractor" means any person with whom the city shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti. 
(Prior code § 17-62) 
9.16.040 - Graffiti prohibited. 
    It is unlawful for any person to write, paint or draw upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, other structure, tree or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as "graffiti" within the city. 
(Prior code § 17-63) 
9.16.050 - Violation-Penalty. 
    Any person who is convicted of violating Section 9.16.040 of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed three months or both such fine and imprisonment. In addition to such punishment, the court may, in imposing the sentence, order the defendant to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed. (Amended during 4/06 supplement; prior code § 17-64) 
9.16.060 - Notice of removal. 
    Whenever the public works director or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti exists on any public and private buildings, structures and places which are visible to any person utilizing any public right-of-way in this city, be this road, parkway, alley or otherwise and that seasonal temperatures permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the public works director or his/her designated representative shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti, or the same will be subject to abatement by the city. 
    The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall cause a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owner's name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of the county of Perry. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners: 
A.  By personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or control of the property; 
B.  By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address. 
The notice shall be substantially in the following form: 

NOTICE OF INTENT TO REMOVE GRAFFITI: 
Date: 
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required by law at your expense to remove or paint over the graffiti located on the property commonly known as ___________, Perryville, Missouri, which is visible to public view, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this notice; or, if you fail to do so, City employees or private contractors employed by the city will enter upon your property and abate the public nuisance by removal or painting over the graffiti. The cost of abatement by the city employees or its private contractors will be assessed upon your property and such costs will constitute a lien upon the land until paid. 
All persons having any objection to, or interest in said matters are hereby notified to submit any objections or comments to the public works director of the City of Perryville or his/her designated representatives within five (5) days from the date of this notice. At the conclusion of this fifteen (15) day period the city may proceed with the abatement of the graffiti inscribed on your property at your expense without further notice.

    Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance under the provisions of this chapter may constitute a lien against the property upon which such nuisance existed.

    Within ten days from the mailing or personal service of the notice, the owner or person occupying or controlling such premises or lot affected may appeal to the city administrator. 
(Prior code § 17-67) 
9.16.090 - Removal by city. 
    Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the public works director or his/her designated representative approves, then the public works director is authorized and directed to cause the graffiti to be abated by city forces or private contract, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the premises for such purposes. All reasonable efforts to minimize such damage from such entry shall be taken by the city, and any paint used to obliterate graffiti shall be as close as practicable to background color(s). If the public works director provides for the removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material, he shall not authorize nor undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than that where the graffiti or other inscribed material is located. 
(Prior code § 17-68) 
9.16.100 - Private property consent forms. 
    Property owners in the city may consent in advance to the city entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes. The city will make forms for such consent available.

The findings of the board that a majority of such owners have not filed protest shall be conclusive and final. No publication shall be necessary for the making of any sidewalks, but on the petition of any ten citizens of the city the board of aldermen may make contracts for the construction of sidewalks, including grading therefor, with or without curbing, along any street, avenue or other public highway, or any part thereof whatever. The contract shall be let to the lowest and best bidder, upon plans and specifications filed therefor by the city engineer or other officer designated by the board of aldermen, with the city clerk, not less than one week's advertisement for bids thereupon being made in some newspaper published in the city. When upon proper advertisement no bid is received, the board of aldermen may proceed as provided herein.

12.08.050 - Street repairs-Cost. 
    No formality shall be required to authorize the repairing of sidewalks, or of street or other paving, curbing, guttering, macadamizing or part thereof, or reconstructing the same, and making assessments therefor; but the proper officer or committee on improvements may, without notice, cause such work to be done, keeping an account of the cost thereof, and reporting the same to the board of aldermen for assessment; and each lot or piece of ground abutting on such sidewalk, street, avenue or alley, or part thereof, shall be liable for its part of the cost of any work or improvement provided for herein, done or made along or in front of such lot or piece of ground as reported to the board of aldermen, and all lands, lots and public parks owned by any county or city, and all other public lands, all cemeteries, owned by public, private or municipal corporations; provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any assessment against any cemetery lot, and all railroad rights-of-way fronting or abutting on any of such improvements shall be liable for their proportionate part of the cost of such work and improvements, and tax bills shall be issued against such property as against other property, and any county or city that shall own any such property shall out of the general revenue funds pay any such tax bill, and in any case where any county or city or railroad company shall fail to pay any such tax bill, the owner of the same may sue such county, city or railroad company on such tax bill and be entitled to recover a general judgment against such county, city or railroad company. Any of the improvements to be paid for by such city may be paid for by the city out of the general revenue funds if the council so desires, but all such work and improvements shall be paid for with special tax bills unless the proceedings of the city for the same specify that payment will be made out of the general revenue funds of the city. The board of aldermen may provide a penalty for failure to pay such special tax within a given time, and any tax bills issued in payment of such repairs shall constitute a lien upon the property liable therefor until paid. All costs for building and constructing sidewalks shall be paid to the contractor therefor, in special tax bills assessed against the abutting property liable therefor, and such tax bills shall constitute a lien upon such property until paid, and shall bear interest at eight percent per annum from the date of issue.

Chapter 12.12 - SURFACE WATER RUNOFF 

12.12.010 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
    "Sinkhole" means any opening, crevice or other depression in the surface or below the surface of the earth. 
    "Stormwater" means that portion of the rainfall or other precipitation which runs off over the surface during a storm and for such a short period following a storm as the flow exceeds the normal or ordinary runoff. 
    "Surface water" means that portion of rainfall or other precipitation which runs off over the surface of the ground. 
    "Watercourse" means land which has a conformation so as to give surface water flowing from one tract of land to another tract of land a fixed and determinate course so as to uniformly discharge it upon the servient tract at a fixed and definite point. It includes, but is not limited to, ravines, swales, sinkholes or depressions of greater or lesser depth, extending from one tract and so situated as to gather up the surface water flowing upon dominant tract, and to conduct along a definite course to a definite point of discharge upon servient tract. It shall not be deemed to be important that the force of the water flowing from one tract of land to another has not been sufficient to wear out a channel or canal, having definite or well-marked sides or banks. If the surface water, in fact, uniformly or habitually flows over a given course having reasonable limits as to the width of the line of its flow, it shall be considered to have a definite course. 
(Prior code § 241/2-1) 
12.12.020 - Obstruction of watercourses and sinkholes prohibited. 
    It is unlawful for any person to block, obstruct, destroy, cover, fill or alter in any way a watercourse or sinkhole, or any part thereof, so as to cause damage to the property of other persons from surface water. 
(Prior code § 241/2-2) 
12.12.030 - Violation-Public nuisance. 
    A violation of Section 12.12.020 shall be deemed to be a public nuisance as well as a misdemeanor. Whenever the city engineer or city administrator has determined that a person has blocked, obstructed, destroyed, covered, filled or altered in any way a watercourse or sinkhole so as to cause surface water damage to the property of others, the city engineer or city administrator is authorized to proceed in accordance with Chapter 8.20, so as to abate the public nuisance. The city engineer or city administrator shall proceed in accordance with the authority granted to and as though the city engineer or city administrator was the city health officer under Chapter 8.20 in ordering such nuisance abated. 
(Prior code § 241/2-3) 
12.12.040 - Building permits-Issuance. 
    Whenever the zoning administrator, building inspector, or city engineer of the city has reason to believe that work performed pursuant to a building permit may be in an area defined as a watercourse or sinkhole, or that work performed pursuant to a building permit may in some way interfere with the use and operation of a watercourse or sinkhole, or may violate the provisions of Section 12.12.020, the zoning administrator, building inspector or city engineer, before issuing or consenting to a building permit, shall refer the request for a building permit to the city administration for approval. Upon the matter being referred to the city administrator, the city administrator shall determine whether or not the work performed pursuant to the building permit will interfere with the use and operation of the watercourse or sinkhole. The city administrator may require the person requesting the building permit to submit information to the city administrator concerning the capacity of the watercourse or sinkhole, the amount of surface water runoff in the drainage area, and the amount of surface water runoff that would be caused by the issuance of the building permit. The city administrator, before approving the request, shall determine whether or not the applicant has made adequate provisions for surface water runoff so that the project will not interfere with the use and operation of a watercourse or sinkhole, except nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the altering of a watercourse so long as it is done pursuant to a permit and provided the change does not cause damage to others or creates a condition which could cause damage to others in the opinion of the administrator. The permit may be conditioned upon compliance with standards established by the administrator so as to protect public health, safety and welfare so as to insure the project will not interfere with the use of the watercourse or sinkhole and that adequate provisions are made to protect the watercourse or sinkhole from any work being performed pursuant to the building permit. 
    In the event the city administrator determines that the permit cannot be issued because the city administrator has determined that the applicant cannot meet the condition, or has refused to meet the condition, the applicant shall be notified in writing and given an opportunity to present alternative plans to protect the watercourse or sinkhole, or to guarantee that the work will not interfere with the use of the watercourse or sinkhole. In the event the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the city administrator, the applicant shall have the right to appeal the city administrator's decision to the board of aldermen, except no permit shall be issued unless the applicant can show that the provisions of Section 12.12.020 of this chapter will not be violated. The permit shall also provide that the applicant cannot block, obstruct, destroy, cover, fill or alter in any way whatsoever a watercourse or sinkhole so as to cause damage to adjoining property from surface water and that in the event it is determined that adjoining property is damaged, the authority to perform work pursuant to the building permit shall be null and void. 
(Prior code § 241/2-4) 
12.12.050 - Posting of land. 
    It is unlawful for any person to block, obstruct, destroy, cover, fill or alter in any way a watercourse or sinkhole when the watercourse or sinkhole has been posted by the city in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter. When the city administrator has determined that a person is blocking, obstructing, destroying, covering, filling or altering a watercourse or sinkhole which, in the opinion of the city administrator, will now or in the future cause damage to adjoining property, the city administrator is authorized to post private property, which posting shall clearly designate that the blocking, obstructing, destroying, covering, filling or altering in any way is prohibited. The city administrator shall give notice to the owner of the property, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter 8.20, that it is unlawful for any person to fill, block, obstruct, cover, destroy or in any way alter the watercourse or sinkhole when the city administrator has determined that the damage to adjoining property might reasonably be caused now or in the future by such actions. The owner of the property may request a hearing before the city administrator, at which time the owner shall submit information pertaining to drainage as described in Section 12.12.040. The owner may request a hearing in front of the city administrator, and the owner shall at that time submit evidence concerning the surface water runoff in the area and his plans for the watercourse. In the event the city administrator determines that the owner's plans for the watercourse will not cause damage to adjoining property owners, the city administrator shall cause the order prohibiting the blocking, obstructing, destroying, filling, covering or altering to be removed. Adjoining property owners shall be notified of any hearing held in front of the city administrator, and such property owner may appear in the matter to be heard. In the event the city administrator determines that no further blocking, obstructing, filling, covering or altering of the watercourse can be permitted, the city administrator shall enter into an order so stating. The owner of the property for which a notice has been issued may appeal the decision of the city administrator under this section pursuant to the provisions of the administrative procedure act. 
(Prior code § 241/2-5) 
12.12.060 - Obstructing drainage. 
    Any person who shall destroy, tear up or otherwise injure, or fill up or otherwise obstruct any sewer, gutter, trench or channel dug, made or used for the purpose of carrying off water from or draining any street within the city shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(Prior code § 241/2-6) 
12.12.070 - Sinkhole remediation and management. 
A.  Remediation and Management. The city shall accept responsibility for the remediation and management of sinkholes for which it has been granted a permanent easement by the property owner under the terms and conditions set forth in this section. 
B.  Developed Property. The owner of a developed lot may apply to the city and request that the city accept responsibility for remediation and management of the sinkhole on said developed lot. If the city accepts said responsibility, then it shall design and construct the sinkhole improvement features. The property owner shall grant to the city an easement of a size no less than fifty (50) feet by fifty (50) feet square centered on the center of the sinkhole or the standpipe designed by the city. The property owner shall also grant an easement for ingress and egress to the sinkhole easement. The city shall only be responsible for the maintenance of the sinkhole utility designed and installed by it; all mowing, surface debris removal, and other aesthetic maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
C.  Undeveloped Property. The owner of any undeveloped property shall be responsible for constructing sinkhole improvement features in a manner approved by the city prior to the development of the property. After the sinkhole improvement is constructed and installed, the owner of the undeveloped property may apply to the city and request that the city accept responsibility for remediation and management of the sinkhole on said undeveloped property. If the city accepts said responsibility, the property owner shall grant to the city an easement of a size no less than fifty (50) feet by fifty (50) feet square centered on the center of the standpipe constructed and installed unless the city determines that the property is used for agricultural purposes. In that event the minimum easement size shall be one hundred (100) feet by one hundred (100) feet square centered on the center of the standpipe constructed and installed. The property owner shall also grant an easement for ingress and egress to the sinkhole easement. The city shall only be responsible for the maintenance of the sinkhole utility constructed by the property owner and accepted by the city; all mowing, surface debris removal, and other aesthetic maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
D.  Partially Developed Property. Upon being notified that a sinkhole exists on what the city determines to be a partially developed property, the city may agree to enter into a cost share agreement with the property owner in order to construct sinkhole improvement features. If the city accepts said responsibility, the city shall provide the design of the sinkhole improvement and the labor and equipment necessary to improve the sinkhole. The property owner shall pay for all materials necessary to construct the sinkhole improvement. The city may in its sole discretion determine that the sinkhole improvement will be constructed by private contractors. In that event, the property owner shall pay fifty (50) percent of the cost of constructing the sinkhole improvement. At the city's sole discretion the property owner's share of the cost of constructing the sinkhole improvement may be covered by the issuance of a special tax bill against the property upon which the sinkhole improvement is made and such special tax bill shall become a lien on the property in the same manner as provided elsewhere in this code for special tax bills. The property owner shall grant to the city an easement of a size no less than fifty (50) feet by fifty (50) feet square centered on the center of the standpipe constructed and installed unless the city determines that the property is used for agricultural purposes. In that event the minimum easement size shall be one hundred (100) feet by one hundred (100) feet square centered on the center of the standpipe constructed and installed. The property owner shall also grant an easement for ingress and egress to the sinkhole easement. The city shall only be responsible for the maintenance of the sinkhole utility constructed; all mowing, surface debris removal, and other aesthetic maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
(Ord. No. 5437, § 1, 6-25-13) 
12.12.080 - Sinkhole improvement plan. 
A.  Policy Statement. Sinkholes provide a vital stormwater function within the city of Perryville. The Karst topography of the area is very prone to sinkholes and it is the responsibility of the city to enforce proper sinkhole maintenance and development to best protect the citizens, property and environment. The goal is not to develop every sinkhole within the city but only those deemed necessary by the city. This policy shall serve to guide that improvement. 
B.  Preferred Sinkhole Improvement Method. The city's typical sinkhole improvement process consists of excavating the depression and removing any debris (e.g. trash, soil, mud, gravel, etc.) present to expose the crevice or opening in the bedrock of the Karst subsurface system. Ideally, the crevice is excavated completely and a vertical standpipe (a forty-eight (48) inch diameter pre-cast concrete manhole preferred) is installed over the crevice. Any portions of the crevice that extend beyond the edge of the standpipe are grouted with low-slump concrete to effectively prevent groundwater from penetrating the crevice except through the opening within the standpipe. The standpipe is extended to the existing or proposed final ground elevation and the structure backfilled with graded crushed rock and compacted earth. The area around the standpipe is graded to allow surface runoff to drain into the standpipe opening. The standpipe shall be covered with a trash rack or other suitable grated intake to help ensure safety and prevent larger debris from entering the standpipe. Wherever possible, the area immediately surrounding the improved sinkhole is established as a vegetated buffer as a means of filtration to prevent sediment and other contaminants from entering the standpipe. The city shall acquire a permanent easement for perpetual maintenance of the improved sinkhole as set forth in Section 12.12.070. In general, the agricultural areas within the city limits will minimally require a 50-foot easement, measured from the center of the standpipe, to be used as a vegetative buffer area. In other areas within the city limits, the preferred easement and vegetative buffer area will minimally be a 25-foot radius measured from the center of the standpipe. It may be possible to reduce this vegetative buffer provided property owners apply herbicide in strict accordance with the instructions found on the label, maintaining appropriate set back requirements while also keeping in mind any aquatic life restrictions. (sinkhole improvement details at Section 12.12.080.F). 
C.  Alternative Sinkhole Improvement Methods. Each sinkhole improvement is unique due to variables such as the crevice depth and geometry, surface runoff drainage area, and the location of the sinkhole relative to existing and proposed developments. It may be necessary to take a customized approach on a specific sinkhole improvement and assess various design alternatives. These alternate approaches to improving the sinkhole may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Using a smaller diameter standpipe if the surface drainage area is small and/or if access to the crevice by a person is not necessary. 
2.  If the sinkhole location does not allow for the preferred buffer, and with the approval of the city, storm water runoff can be directed to a sedimentation or detention basin upstream of the sinkhole standpipe, mechanical filters upstream of the piping connection to the standpipe may be utilized, or other suitable methods to improve surface runoff water quality may be used with the approval of the city. 
D.  Temporary Best Management Practices. Prior to, during, and after sinkholes are improved it is important that any necessary best management practices (BMP's) are utilized when construction or land disturbance activities are performed within the watershed of a particular sinkhole. When any activities are performed upstream of the sinkhole that may induce sedimentation and pollution of surface water runoff, siltation and erosion control methods shall be installed. Additionally, any work on or in the immediate vicinity of the sinkhole shall be performed with siltation and erosion control measures in place and shall be timed with concern for weather conditions to minimize the possibility of sedimentation and polluted runoff from entering the sinkhole. 
E.  Permanent Best Management Practices. After sinkholes are improved it is important that any necessary best management practices (BMP's) are implemented. The primary BMP for surface water runoff quality shall be the vegetated buffer, or alternatively a sedimentation or detention basin, mechanical filters, or other method as approved by the city. Sinkholes will be inspected regularly and vegetated buffers shall be maintained by mowing or trimming methods rather than using chemical treatment. Grass clippings or other debris shall be kept clear from the standpipe opening.

Article 4. - Cross-Connections 

13.12.530 - Definitions. 
    As used in this article: 
    "Cross-connection" is any physical connection between a potable water supply and any waste pipe, soil pipe, sewer, drain or any unapproved source or system. Furthermore, it is any potable water supply outlet which is submerged or can be submerged in wastewater and/or any other source of contamination and any source or system that is, in the opinion of the building inspector, based on the standards of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, nonpotable and through which backflow can occur to contaminate the city's system. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow can occur are to be considered as cross-connections. Cross-connections may be considered as direct or indirect. 
    "Direct cross-connection" is where the city's water system is physically joined to a system containing unsafe water, sewage or other waste that could contaminate the safe water system. 
    "Indirect cross-connection" may be a condition where a source of contaminated water may be blown across, sucked or diverted into the city's system. 
(Prior code § 28-156)

In the case where several buildings are to be connected to a public sewer, with a line of such size as is approved by the city engineer and city superintendent of sewer and water, the fee shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus the standard sewer connection fee for each building served. In the case of industrial buildings for which application to connect to the public sewer is made, the board of aldermen shall determine the amount of payment to be made, and it may further place certain restrictions on the use of such connection as concern the volume and character of the sewage to be discharged into the public sewer. 
B.  The person making the application and obtaining a permit to proceed with a connection shall pay the entire cost of labor, materials and all else required for such connection. 
C.  The fee paid for the authority to make such connection shall in no way be taken as the purchase price of any vested right in such public sewer, but the same shall be deemed and held as rental money for the sewer to which the connection has been made until such time as sewers shall be constructed in the district in which such connecting property lies, at which time the property shall be assessed its proportionate share of the cost of such construction as if the previous connection outside the district did not exist. Also, at the time such sewers are constructed, no refund of the fee collected by the city shall be made as the same shall be used in the maintenance of the sewer system in which the connection was made. 
D.  The city clerk shall keep a special record showing all receipts and connections so made. 
E.  The connections above described shall conform to all the provisions of this chapter.

A.  For each district sewer which is financed by special assessments against land within the district, there should be established a special assessment fee. Any property owner who annexes to or is annexed by the city, or any property owner who connects to the sewers in a district for which such property has not previously been assessed, shall pay an assessment equal to the square foot assessment, or if assessed by lot or potential connection, the assessment therefor, for district sewers established at the time of levy of the assessment against the real estate reasonably served by such district in the same portion as other similarly situated properties within the district at the time of levy of the assessment. 
B.  The special assessment fee shall be established at the time of levy of the original special assessments, and shall remain on file in the office of the city clerk. The special assessment shall bear interest at the same percentage as the special assessment tax bills issued for the original district. Such special assessments shall be paid no later than the time at which the unassessed property or any part thereof is connected to the sewer system as annexed by the city. 
C.  This fee shall be levied only upon real estate which was included in the original district boundaries but was not assessed therefor because the same was not within the city limits or excluded by the property owner, and shall be levied only upon real estate within the district. 
D.  No sewer tap to the district sewer line shall be permitted prior to the payment in full of the fee established herein, compliance with regulations of the city, and payment of any fee otherwise required by city ordinance. 
E.  The fees provided for herein are for the purpose of reimbursing the city for its payment of the proportionate share of the total district not originally assessed against benefitted property. 
F.  Contemporaneous with the levy of the special assessment, the city shall establish the amount of special assessment for the property not assessed within the boundary of the district by preparation of a special assessment tax bill for said property, and same shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk.

a.  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty (60) degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
b.  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 9.0, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment. 
c.  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference. 
d.  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW. 
e.  Wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit (forty (40) degrees Celsius). 
f.  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
g.  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
h.  Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the city administrator in accordance with Section 13.20.030 of this chapter. 
i.  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair. 
j.  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit. 
k.  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
l.  Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the city administrator. 
m.  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes. 
n.  Medical wastes except as specifically authorized by the city administrator in an individual wastewater discharge permit. 
o.  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail toxicity test. 
p.  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which might cause excessive foaming in the POTW. 
q.  Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations greater than one hundred (100) mg/L. 
r.  Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
3.  Any waters or wastes containing the following substances to such a degree that the total mass loading from all SIU's exceeds the quantity specified in the table below. The public works director will develop the permit limitations for all users that meet the definition of S.I.U. as defined by city ordinance. The Table of Masses is as follows: 
Total Mass Allowable (lbs) from S.I.U.'s
(Monthly Average) 
Pollutant Mass (lbs) Ag (T) 0.35 Cd (T) .010 CN 0.090 Cr (T) 3.1 Cu (T) 0.63 Ni (T) 1.0 Pb (T) 0.22 Zn (T) 1.8 Cr VI (T) 0.067  
B.  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. 
1.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the city administrator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with this section. 
2.  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the city administrator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
3.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city administrator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
4.  A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section. 
a.  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a 'net' basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of this section are met. 
b.  Criteria. 
i.  Either (1) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (2) the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
ii.  Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
iii.  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s) up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section. 
iv.  Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
5.  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the city administrator. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in the following paragraphs of this section. 
a.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
i.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit. 
ii.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment. 
iii.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions. 
iv.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge. 
v.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
i.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits. 
ii.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device. 
iii.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the city administrator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty (20) percent from its baseline production rates determined in this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the city administrator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility. 
iv.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the city administrator: 
i.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor. 
ii.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility. 
iii.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to this section. The industrial user must also be in compliance with this chapter regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
6.  The city administrator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the city administrator. 
7.  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
8.  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
9.  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the city administrator within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the city administrator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
C.  State Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with Missouri State Pretreatment Standards codified at 10 CSR 20-6.100. 
D.  City's Right of Revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter. 
E.  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city administrator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15; Ord. No. 5705, § 1, 10-6-15; Ord. No. 6130 , § 1, 3-5-19) 
13.20.030 - Wastewater pretreatment. 
A.  Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the city administrator, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city administrator for review and shall be acceptable to the city administrator before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Additional Pretreatment Measures. 
1.  Whenever deemed necessary, the city administrator may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The city administrator may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
3.  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city administrator, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at their expense. 
4.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
C.  Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans. The city administrator shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The city administrator may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the city administrator may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
1.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges. 
2.  Description of stored chemicals. 
3.  Procedures for immediately notifying the city administrator of any accidental or slug discharge as required in this chapter. 
4.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
D.  Hauled Wastewater. 
1.  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the city administrator and at such times as are established by the city administrator. Such waste shall not violate this chapter or any other requirements established by the city. The city administrator may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. 
2.  The city administrator may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The city administrator may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The city administrator also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter. 
3.  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the city administrator. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the city administrator. The city administrator may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The city administrator may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
4.  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15) 
13.20.040 - Individual wastewater discharge permits. 
A.  Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the city administrator, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within sixty (60) days of the request. The city administrator is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
B.  Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement. 
1.  No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit from the city administrator, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to this section may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. 
2.  The city administrator may require other users to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
3.  Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law. 
C.  Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting Existing Connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this chapter and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within thirty (30) days after said date, apply to the city administrator for an individual wastewater discharge permit in accordance with this section and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after ninety (90) days of the effective date of this chapter except in accordance with an individual wastewater discharge permit issued by the city administrator. 
D.  Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting New Connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge.

13.20.060 - Reporting requirements. 
A.  Baseline Monitoring Reports. 
1.  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the city administrator a report which contains the information listed below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall submit to the city administrator a report which contains the information listed below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
2.  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
a.  Required Information. All information required in Section 13.20.040 of this chapter. 
b.  Measurement of Pollutants. 
i.  The user shall provide the information required in Section 13.20.040 of this chapter. 
ii.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subparagraph. 
iii.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority. 
iv.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with this section. 
v.  The city administrator may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
vi.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and analysis are representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
c.  Compliance Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in this section. 
e.  Signature and Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with this section and signed by an authorized representative as defined in this chapter. 
B.  Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by this section: 
1.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation). 
2.  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months. 
3.  The user shall submit a progress report to the city administrator no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule. 
4.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city administrator. 
C.  Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city administrator a report containing the information described in this chapter. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this section. All sampling will be done in conformance with this section. 
D.  Periodic Compliance Reports. All significant industrial users are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if they have been designated a non-significant categorical industrial user under the provisions of this section. 
1.  Except as specified in this section, all significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the city administrator, submit no less than twice per year in May and November reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards, and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the city administrator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
2.  The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
b.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
c.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
d.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with this chapter and include the certification statement in 6.14 A [40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)]. 
e.  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
f.  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the city administrator must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the city administrator for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
g.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the city administrator, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement set forth below that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user. 
h.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the city administrator and notify the city administrator. 
i.  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standards. 
3.  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this section. 
4.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
5.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the city administrator using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
E.  Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the city administrator of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change. 
1.  The city administrator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under this chapter. 
2.  The city administrator may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
F.  Reports of Potential Problems. 
1.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge, or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city administrator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
2.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city administrator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
3.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge as described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
4.  Significant industrial users are required to notify the city administrator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
G.  Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city administrator as the city administrator may require. 
H.  Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city administrator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city administrator within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
I.  Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city administrator or other parties approved by EPA. 
J.  Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
1.  Except as indicated below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city administrator. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
3.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports required in this section [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city administrator may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by this section (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
K.  Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
L.  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city administrator. 
M.  Certification Statements. 
1.  Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports, and Initial Monitoring Waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with this chapter; users submitting baseline monitoring reports under this section; users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under this section; users submitting periodic compliance reports required by this section; and users submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a pollutant on the basis of this section.

(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15; Ord. No. 5888, § 2, 5-27-2017) 
13.20.070 - Compliance monitoring. 
A.  Right of Entry; Inspection and Sampling. The city administrator shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
1.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city administrator shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
2.  The city administrator shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
3.  The city administrator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
4.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
5.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city administrator access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
B.  Search Warrants. If the city administrator has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, the city administrator may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of Perry County, Missouri. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15) 
13.20.080 - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city administrator's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city administrator that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15) 
13.20.090 - Publication of industrial users in significant noncompliance. 
    The city administrator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates this section and shall mean: 
A.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined herein as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in this chapter. 
B.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined herein as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined in this chapter, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH) 
C.  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined herein (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the city administrator determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public. 
D.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the city administrator's exercise of the city administrator's emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge. 
E.  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance. 
F.  Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules. 
G.  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
H.  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the city administrator determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15) 
13.20.100 - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
A.  Notification of Violation. When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city administrator. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city administrator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
B.  Consent Orders. The city administrator may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
C.  Show Cause Hearing. The city administrator may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the city administrator and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
D.  Compliance Orders. When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
E.  Cease and Desist Orders. When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city administrator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements. 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
F.  Administrative Fines. 
1.  When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may fine such user in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
2.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after ninety (90) calendar days, be a lien against the real estate where the violation occurred. The lien shall be perfected as a tax bill against the property where the violation occurred. The tax bill shall accrue interest at the same rate as set for the United States Treasury bills on the date when the tax bill is recorded. All tax bills issued under the provisions of this section shall be valid in all respects as other special tax bills provided for by state law and collected in the manner and under the provisions provided by Chapter 88 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri. 
3.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city administrator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city administrator may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city administrator may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
4.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
G.  Emergency Suspensions. The city administrator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city administrator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
1.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city administrator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city administrator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city administrator that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in this section are initiated against the user. 
2.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city administrator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
H.  Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
1.  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions. 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge. 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge. 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
5.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in this chapter. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city administrator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15; Ord. No. 5888, § 3, 5-27-2017) 
13.20.110 - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
A.  Injunctive Relief. When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may petition the Circuit Court of Perry County, Missouri, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city administrator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
B.  Civil Penalties. 
1.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
2.  The city administrator may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
3.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
4.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
C.  Criminal Prosecution. 
1.

(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15) 
13.20.130 - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
A.  Upset. 
1.  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
2.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (A)(3) below are met. 
3.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset. 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city administrator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
6.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
B.  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in this chapter or the specific prohibitions in this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
1.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference. 
2.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
C.  Bypass. 
1.  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of this section. 
D.  Bypass Notifications. 
1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city administrator at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  A user shall submit oral notice to the city administrator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city administrator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
E.  Bypass. 
1.  Bypass is prohibited and the city administrator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance. 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under this section. 
2.  The city administrator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city administrator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in the surcharge costs and billing procedures. 
(Ord. No. 5658, § 1, 7-7-15) 
13.20.140 - Surcharge costs and billing procedures. 
A.  Industrial User Surcharge. 
1.  All industrial users that are allowed to discharge five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or total suspended solids (TSS) in excess of two hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter shall be subject to an industrial user surcharge. The surcharge is in addition to the user service charge defined in this chapter. The purpose of the surcharge is to ensure that industrial users pay a proportionate share of the costs of operating, maintaining, and financing the city sewer system. The charge to each industrial user for which the charge is applicable shall be based on the surcharge pounds of BOD plus TSS discharged. 
2.  The following formula shall be used for determining the industrial user surcharge (IUS): 
IUS = A/B 
Where, 
IUS = The charge in dollars per pound of BOD plus TSS for the surcharge pounds of these pollutant parameters. 
A   = Estimated annual costs in dollars to operate, maintain, and finance the city sewer system. 
B   = Estimated annual pounds of BOD plus TSS received at the city wastewater treatment plant. 
3.  The city shall review the industrial user surcharge annually in conjunction with the user service charge and revise the rate as necessary to ensure that the systems generate adequate revenues to pay the cost of operation and maintenance, including replacement, and that the systems continue to provide for the proportional distribution of costs among users. 
4.  The city will notify each industrial user at least annually, in conjunction with a regular sewer bill, of the industrial user surcharge rate. 
B.  Monitoring. All significant industrial users connected to the city sewer system shall be monitored by the city a minimum of once per year or as often as necessary to determine their hydraulic and organic contribution. The results of the monitoring shall be used to calculate the industrial user surcharge amount. 
C.  Billing. All significant industrial users subject to the industrial user surcharge will be billed by the city by the fifteenth (15th) of each month. 
D.  Failure to Pay. If and when any industrial user subject to the industrial user surcharge fails to make payment to the city by the last day of the month, after proper billing by the city by the fifteenth (15th) of the month, the city is directed to recover any sums due to the city under this section and enforce any provisions of this code to effectuate same. 
E.  Inhibitory Pollutants-Service Charge. Any user of the city sewer system that discharges, occasionally or routinely, any inhibitory or toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the wastewater treatment plant, or any user that discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the costs of operation, maintenance, or replacement of the wastewater treatment plant, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the city administrator and approved by the board of aldermen. 
F.  Installation and Location of Monitoring Manhole. When required by the city, the owner of any property served by a sewer service connection carrying industrial wastewater shall install, at the owner's expense, a suitable monitoring manhole in the service sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the discharge. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city.

13.24.365 - Natural gas-Budget billing. 
A.  Any residential customer who has not been shut off by the city for nonpayment of a utility bill and who has been a residential customer at the current residence for at least the preceding twelve (12) months may enter into a contract with the city for budget billing of such residential customer's natural gas bill in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section. The purpose of this section is to allow eligible residential customers to pay a reasonably expected amount each month, and nothing in this section shall be construed to be forgiveness by the city of any amount due from the residential customer for actual natural gas use. 
B.  The city may enter into a contract with an eligible residential customer for budget billing under the terms and conditions of this section with the contract stating: 
1.  That the city will add the residential customer's current month's natural gas bill to the previous eleven (11) months' natural gas bills and divide by twelve (12). That result will be the residential customer's budget billing amount due for the month. The city will continue that procedure every month during the duration of the budget billing agreement; 
2.  That the residential customer shall pay the budget billed amount in accordance with this section; 
3.  That the city retains the right to bill the customer for the actual natural gas amount due if the city, in its absolute discretion, has determined that the amount due has become excessive; 
4.  That the contract will be automatically renewed at the end of each twelve (12) month period for an additional twelve (12) month period unless the residential customer requests that the contract not be renewed prior to the end of each year term; 
5.  That the residential customer may reject the renewal of the budget billing contract upon notice to the city at least fifteen (15) days prior to the end of a normal billing cycle; 
6.  That the residential customer shall ultimately be responsible to pay for all natural gas actually used at the actual natural gas rate (as defined in subsection C of this section); 
7.  That in the event the customer fails to pay any utility bill when due, the budget billing contract will be null and void and the customer will immediately owe the city for all natural gas actually used; 
8.  That all other requirements of the code of ordinances of the city must be met by the residential customer; and 
9.  Such other provisions as may be necessary to effect the intent of this section. 
C.  Budget billing will be computed by adding the residential customer's current month's natural gas bill to the previous eleven (11) month's natural gas bill and dividing that sum by twelve (12). That result will be the residential customer's budget billing amount due for the month. The city will continue that procedure every month during the duration of the budget billing agreement. 
D.  In order to implement the budget billing process, the city will determine the amount of "historical natural gas monthly usage" by the residential customer for each month for the twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the budget billing. The city will determine the "projected natural gas rates" provided by the city's natural gas consultant showing the "projected natural gas rates" for the twelve (12) months of the budget billing cycle. The city will then compute the residential customer's "projected monthly natural gas bill" for each of the twelve (12) months of the budget billing cycle. The residential customer's "projected monthly natural gas bill" for the next twelve (12) months will then be added together and divided by twelve (12) to establish the "base monthly natural gas bill" amount for the budget billing cycle. The residential customer shall then be obligated to pay the "base monthly natural gas bill" plus the "monthly adjustment," which amount shall be the "actual monthly amount due." If in the final month of the budget billing cycle the total amount paid to date is not equal to the total "actual monthly natural gas bill" for the year, the city shall make a final adjustment.

(Prior code § 15-66) 
13.24.390 - Nonpayment of charges by tenant-Liability of property owner. 
    Each property owner shall be liable for all charges for natural gas consumed left unpaid by his tenant where such property owner has countersigned the application for gas service on the premises occupied by his tenant and the city reserves the right to shut off any gas service where such delinquent charges are not paid for by the owner. 
(Prior code § 15-67) 
13.24.400 - Average bill may be rendered when meter defective. 
    Whenever the city finds any meter not registering, an average bill may be rendered to the customer, at the option of the city. This average bill shall be based upon a timeframe that most accurately reflects recent usage patterns and/or previous usage history. Whenever the city has reason to believe that a meter is not registering correctly, an average bill, as stated above, may be rendered and the meter removed for testing. If such average bill proves to be incorrectly estimated, either by actual testing or by actual gas consumption after being replaced by a corrected meter, such bill shall be adjusted accordingly.

(Ord. 4583 § 2, 2004; prior code § 8-111) 
15.16.020 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to control soil erosion on land that is undergoing development for non-agricultural uses and to preserve the natural terrain and waterways of the land within the city. Soil erosion scars the land and creates sediment that clogs storm sewers and road ditches; chokes streams and creates silt bars, all of which pose a threat to public health and safety. The provisions in this chapter are intended to provide a natural community environment, to prevent soft erosion and to reduce costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, water conveyance systems, roads and embankments. Application of the regulations in this chapter will effectively control soil erosion and sedimentation. (See also Chapter 12.12 and Section 16.16.060). 
(Prior code § 8-100) 
15.16.030 - Scope of authority. 
A.  Permit Required. Any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to develop land within the city in excess of five acres or which has within its boundaries any part of a sinkhole, shall apply to the office of the city engineer for approval of his or her erosion control plan and issuance of a grading permit as specified in this chapter. No land in excess of five acres or which has within its boundaries any part of a sinkhole shall be graded except upon the issuance of such permit. "Grading" or "graded" as used in this section means the excavation, disturbance or removal of the soil by any earth moving equipment larger than yard and garden tractors or other yard or garden equipment typically used for personal residential purposes. 
B.  Insignificant Grading. In the event the city engineer determines from the application that a proposed grading has insignificant erosion impact and the soft erosion control plan is unnecessary to fulfill the intent of Section 15.16.020, then the city engineer may issue a grading permit which waives the requirements of Section 15.16.040. 
(Prior code § 8-101) 
15.16.040 - Bond requirement. 
    Upon approval of the erosion control plan and the issuance of a grading permit, the city engineer shall require the developer to post a performance bond, escrow agreement, lender's agreement, cash or certified check in the amount of all work to be done under the erosion control plan. This shall be in addition to the board requirements for completion of other improvements necessary for subdivision plat approval. 
(Prior code § 8-102) 
15.16.050 - Inspections. 
    By applying for a grading permit, the applicant consents to the city inspecting the proposed development site and all work in progress. 
(Prior code § 8-106) 
15.16.060 - Erosion and sedimentation control plan content. 
    Grading plans, when required, site plans, preliminary plat of subdivision, or the subdivision improvement plan shall include the following additional information. 
A.  Erosion and sediment control plans submitted to the office of the city clerk shall include two sets of maps and plans with specifications showing proposed excavation, grading or filling, and will include the following: 
1.  Full name and address of property owner; 
2.  Designation of property address; 
3.  Portion of the property that is to be excavated, graded or filled with excavated material; 
4.  Location of any sewerage disposal system, surface water control system or underground utility line, any part of which is within ten feet of the proposed excavation, grading or filling area and the location of any gas transmission pipe line operated at a maximum service pressure in excess of two hundred (200) p.s.i.g., any part of which is within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed excavation, grading or filling area; 
5.  Existing grade and topography of the premises and the proposed finish grade and final contour elevation at a contour interval of not more than two feet; 
6.  Location and present status of any previous permitted grading operation on the property; 
7.  Details of any drainage system proposed to be installed and maintained by the applicant and a comprehensive drainage plan designed to safely handle surface water, streams, or other natural drains following heavy rains during grading operations; 
8.  Details of any proposed water impoundment structures, embankments, debris basins, grass or lined waterways, and diversions with the details and locations of proposed stable outlets; 
9.  Details of soil preparation and revegetation of the finished grade and of other methods of erosion control; 
10.  Delineation of the one hundred (100) year floodplain; 
11.  A statement from the property owner or his agent assuming full responsibility for the performance of the operation as stated in the application. This statement shall also contain assurance that all municipal property or streets will be adequately protected and/or repaired, if damaged. 
B.  The proposed phasing of development of the site, including clearing, rough grading and construction, and final grading and landscaping should identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas and the sequence of clearing, installation of temporary sediment control measures, establishment of storm damage, paving streets and parking areas, and establishment of temporary and permanent vegetative cover. The city engineer may waive specific requirements for the content of submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to show that the plan and work will comply with the objectives and principles of this chapter. 
C.  The developer and city staff shall reference and have copies available for permittees the city's temporary sediment and Erosion Control Standards (Exhibit B) and the Temporary Sediment and Erosion Control Standard set forth in the Proposed Model Land Development Standards and Accompanying Model State Enabling Legislation prepared for and published by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, 1993 Edition (Exhibit A), both of which are adopted by reference. 
(Prior code § 8-103) 
15.16.070 - Plan approval. 
    No grading operation which requires a permit hereunder shall be conducted and no final plat of subdivision shall be recommended for approval by the erosion control officer or the zoning and planning commission unless the preliminary plat and erosion and sediment control plans indicate that measures to be taken will meet erosion control standards. The standards assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of fifteen (15) year frequency, twenty-four (24) hour duration storm (5.7 inches in twenty-four (24) hours) or less, and that the following principles set forth in Section 15.16.080 will be applicable. (Permit approval/disapproval will be indicated within thirty (30) days of erosion and sediment control plan submission.) 
(Prior code § 8-104) 
15.16.080 - Principles and standards. 
A.  All excavations, grading, or filling shall have a finished grade not to exceed a 1:3 (1 horizon to 3 vertical) slope. Steeper grades may be approved by the city engineer if the excavation is through rock or the excavation or fill is protected (a designed head wall or toe wall may be required). Retaining walls that exceed a height of four feet shall require the construction of safety guards as identified in the International Building Code 2015 Edition or subsequent amendments thereto. Permanent safety guards will be constructed in accordance with the International Building Code 2015 Edition or subsequent amendments thereto. 
B.  Grading plans for sites that exceed five acres shall provide for sediment or debris basins, silt traps or filters, staked straw bales, a combination of these measures or other measures approved by the city engineer to remove sediment from run-off waters. The design to be approved by the city engineer. Temporary siltation control measures (structural) shall be maintained until vegetative cover is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. 
C.  Where natural vegetation is removed during grading, vegetation shall be reestablished in such a density as to prevent erosion. Permanent type grasses shall be established as soon as possible or during the next seeding period after grading has been completed. (Refer to Appendix A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and made a part of this chapter by reference.) 
D.  When grading operations are completed or suspended for more than thirty (30) days between permanent grass seeding periods, temporary cover shall be provided according to the city engineer recommendation. (Refer to said Appendix A.) 
E.  Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after grading. Unvegetated open channels shall be designed so that gradients result in velocities of two feet per second (fps) or less. Velocities in permanently vegetated open channels shall not exceed five fps. Unvegetated open channels with velocities more than two fps and less than five fps shall be established in permanent vegetation by use of commercial erosion control blankets or lined with rock riprap or concrete or other suitable materials as approved by the city engineer. Detention basins, diversions or other appropriate structures shall be constructed to prevent velocities above five fps. 
F.  The adjoining ground to development sites (lots) shall be provided with protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt from erosion, and any other consequences of erosion. Run-off water from developed areas (parking lots, paved sites and buildings) above the area to be developed shall be directed to diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters and/or underground outlet systems. Sufficiently anchored straw bales may be substituted with the approval of the city engineer. 
G.  Development along natural watercourses shall have a minimum fifteen (15) foot general maintenance and drainage easement from the top of the existing stream bank. Development shall not encroach on such fifteen (15) foot easement. The watercourse shall be maintained and made the responsibility of the appropriate legal entity. Permanent vegetation should be left intact. Variances will include designed stream bank erosion control measures and shall be approved by the city engineer. FEMA guidelines shall be followed where applicable regarding site development in floodplains.

Chapter 15.17 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
Sections: 
ARTICLE 1. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and Purposes 

15.17.100 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of Missouri has in Section 79.110, RSMo, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the board of aldermen of the city of Perryville, Missouri, ordains as set forth hereinafter. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.110 - Findings of fact. 
A.  Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city of Perryville, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  General Causes of the Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
1.  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
2.  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
C.  Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps: 
1.  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, illustrative materials, and any future revisions thereto. 
2.  Calculation of water surface profiles is based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
3.  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
4.  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
5.  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.120 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 15.17.110 of this code; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.3(b) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses; be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
C.  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
Article 2. - General Provisions 

15.17.200 - Lands to which chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of Perryville, Missouri, identified as unnumbered A zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Perry County maps dated August 2, 2011, on map panel numbers 29157C0095C, 29157C0115C, 29157C0210C, and 29157C0230C, as amended, and any future revisions thereto, as well as any sinkhole basins as identified by the city administrator or his designee. In all areas covered by this chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the board of aldermen or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the board of aldermen or its duly designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted hereinafter. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11; Ord. No. 5952, § 1, 9-19-17) 
15.17.210 - Floodplain administrator. 
    The city administrator's designee is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.220 - Compliance. 
    No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.230 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other chapters inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.240 - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.250 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside unnumbered A zones or land uses permitted within such areas or identified sinkhole basins will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the city of Perryville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11; Ord. No. 5952, § 2, 9-19-17) 
15.17.260 - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11)

(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11; Ord. No. 5952, §§ 4, 5, 9-19-17) 
15.17.410 - Specific standards. 
A.  In all areas of special flood hazard, once base flood elevation data is obtained as set forth in Section 15.17.400 of this code, the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above base flood level. 
2.  Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in Section 15.17.320 of this code. 
3.  Requirement. Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
B.  In all areas of special flood hazard, once floodway data is obtained, as set forth in Section 15.17.400 of this code, the following provisions are required: 
1.  The designated floodway shall be based on the standard that the area chosen for the floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point; and 
2.  The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the designated regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(Ord. No. 5238, § 1, 7-19-11) 
15.17.420 - Manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes to be placed within special flood hazard areas shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(Prior code Appx. A, Art. VII § 1) 
16.12.020 - Street and block layout. 
A.  Street classification shall be limited to four categories in accordance with their use functions: 
1.  Arterial; 
2.  Collector; 
3.  Local (includes cul-de-sac); 
4.  Marginal access (service roads). 
B.  The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper projections where adjoining land is not subdivided). 
C.  The angle of intersection between all streets shall not vary more than ten degrees from a right angle, except by variance in cases of exceptional conditions. Streets in alignment with existing streets shall bear the same name of the existing street. All proposed street names shall be checked against duplication of other street names. 
D.  Except as otherwise provided herein, temporary dead-end streets may be approved where necessitated by the layout of the subdivision or staging of development, provided that temporary unpaved turnarounds shall be constructed where lots are fronting on such temporary dead-end streets. The additional width of the right-of-way required for the temporary turnarounds shall be the same as required for permanent turnarounds. The extra right-of-way shall be vacated upon extension of the temporary street and the reconditioning of said street and front yards shall be at the expense of the subdivider. 
E.  The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity with the major street plan and provide the most advantageous and esthetically pleasing development of the entire neighborhood and adjoining streets. Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. 
F.  The street and alley layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision. Alleys shall be discouraged in residential areas but may be included in commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading and unloading or access purposes.

H.  Intersections shall be designated and constructed to the current standards and specifications of the Missouri State Highway Department or city board of aldermen, as applicable. 
I.  The intersection of more than two streets at one point will not be permitted, nor will street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, except by variance in cases with exceptional conditions. 
J.  Horizontal visibility on curved streets and vertical visibility on all streets shall be maintained along the center line as follows: 
1.  Arterial: five hundred (500) feet; 
2.  Collector: three hundred (300) feet; 
3.  Marginal access: three hundred (300) feet; 
4.  Local: two hundred (200) feet. 
    Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent of not less than one hundred (100) feet on arterial and marginal access streets. 
K.  Blocks shall be of sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of an appropriate depth. The commission may approve block widths providing for a single tier of lots where lots would otherwise front on a major street or where topographic conditions or size of the property prevents two tiers. In the event that a single tier of lots is permitted by the commission and approved by the board of aldermen, an adequate buffer area shall be provided and access from any abutting major street prohibited. 
L.  The length of blocks shall be such as may be appropriate, in the opinion of the planning commission, for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but shall not exceed one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet where the average size of the lot does not exceed two acres in area. 
M.  Each lot shall be provided with direct ingress and egress to a public street or highway, to provide adequately for the layout of utilities, garbage and waste removal, fire and police protection, and other services, and to protect and further the public health and safety generally. Subdivisions intended for commercial and industrial occupancy shall have access to a collector street under all circumstances, except in the case of appropriately separated planned retail centers.

(Prior code § 29-3) 
(Ord. No. 5235, § 7, 6-21-11) 
17.04.040 - Grandfathering. 
A.  The laws of the State of Missouri require that nonconforming activities which have lawfully existed prior to the enactment of zoning ordinances by a city and which are maintained after the effective date of the zoning ordinances be allowed to continue after the zoning ordinances are passed. This requirement is known in the State of Missouri as 'grandfathering.' In order to inform its citizens and to comply with the laws of the State of Missouri, the city establishes this section. 
B.  Protection will be afforded to a nonconforming use if it was lawfully established and in existence at the time the zoning ordinances became effective. Protection specifically applies to minimum lot area, width, and setback requirements for a 'lot of record' as defined in Section 17.04.020 of this code that has been established even if said 'lot of record' violates the zoning ordinances. The protection afforded to a 'lot of record' shall not be limited by subsection C of this section. 
C.  Any activity that existed prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinances of the city may continue within that zone so long as the activity is not abandoned or does not cease. In the event that a person ceases the activity for more than thirty (30) days for reasons other than fire, flood, or other natural disaster, then the activity shall no longer be grandfathered. A nonconforming use may not be altered or expanded unless expressly permitted by the zoning ordinances. In determining whether there has been an alteration or expansion, the nonconforming use will be strictly construed. Except in regards to minimum lot area, width, and setback requirements for 'lot of record,' the grandfathered right to carry on a nonconforming activity within a zoning district shall not continue or be passed on to subsequent owners without the express action of the board of aldermen in accordance with the zoning ordinances of the city. 
D.  The city may, in its absolute discretion, record with the Recorder of Deeds of Perry County, Missouri, a 'Memorandum of Nonconforming Use' in order to notify prospective property owners of the grandfathered use of the property.

The spacing requirements set forth in this chapter shall not apply to on-premise signs (billboards). 
6.  The maximum area of a billboard sign face and display area shall not exceed three hundred (300) square feet with a maximum length of thirty (30) feet. 
7.  Billboards with a maximum sign face area of up to four hundred (400) square feet and a maximum length of forty (40) feet shall be permitted in any C-2, C-4, I-1, I-2 or I-3 zoning district when the sign is adjacent to and within three hundred (300) feet of Interstate 55, Lake Drive (North Outer Road) and Cinque Hommes Drive (South Outer Road) and Perryville Boulevard (Highway 51 By-Pass).

13.  Digital Billboards. 
a.  Purpose and Intent. More businesses desire to utilize advancements in technology which permit signs to change copy electronically (e.g. utilizing an LED type of sign). These newer technologies pose additional risks of impacting adjacent areas and adversely dominating the environment in which they operate unless regulated in a reasonable fashion. The intent of this subsection is to establish operating standards and regulations for digital billboards in order to minimize the secondary effects that often accompany the unregulated display of digital signs, preserve the character and repose of adjacent areas (with a principal focus on residential neighborhoods), protect property values, and reduce traffic hazards caused by undue distractions. 
b.  Display. 
(1)  A digital sign, other than a digital billboard, may not allow the display or message to change more frequently than once every ten seconds, with a transition period of one second or less. 
(2)  A digital sign must have installed an ambient light monitor which shall continuously monitor and automatically adjust the brightness level of the display based on ambient light conditions consistent with the terms of this subsection. 
(3)  The maximum brightness levels for digital signs, other than a digital billboard, shall not exceed two-tenths foot candles over ambient light levels measured within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the source, consistent with the terms of this subsection. Certification must be provided to the city demonstrating that the sign has been preset to automatically adjust the brightness to these levels or lower. Re-inspection and recalibration may be periodically required by the city in its reasonable discretion at the permittee's expense, to ensure that the specified brightness levels are maintained at all times. 
(4)  Brightness of digital signs shall be measured as follows: 
A.  At least thirty (30) minutes following sunset, a foot candle meter shall be used to obtain an ambient light reading for the location. This is done while the sign is off or displaying black copy. The reading shall be made with the meter aimed directly at the sign area at the preset location. 
B.  The sign shall then be turned on to full white copy to take another reading with the meter at the same location. 
C.  If the difference between the readings is two-tenths foot candles or less, the brightness is properly adjusted. If the difference exceeds the level required, then it must be turned off until repaired. 
D.  A digital billboard must comply with all applicable provisions of federal and state law. 
c.  Spacing. 
(1)  Digital billboards may not be erected within five hundred (500) feet of any residential district, within five hundred (500) feet of any other billboard, or within one hundred (100) feet of any free-standing sign on the same side of the road. Existing billboards may be converted to digital LED regardless of proximity to a residential district until the maximum number of billboards have been permitted under subparagraph (c)(3) hereof. 
(2)  Digital billboards may not be erected within thirty (30) feet of any adjacent street pavement edge or curb line. 
(3)  No more than three (3) digital, single-story, double-faced billboards (new or conversion of existing) may be permitted within the Perryville city limits. The city will begin accepting applications for the three digital billboards under this subparagraph twenty-one (21) days after the passage and approval of the ordinance. In the event more than one application for a digital billboard is received on the first day of applications, then the applications will be processed and granted in an order determined by a lottery. In the event a selection lottery is needed, each individual or company may have only one application in the lottery. All other applications will be processed in the order received. Billboard construction must begin within six months of the permit being issued and be completed within nine months or the permit shall be rescinded and issued to the next applicant. Once a permit is issued, it shall be nontransferable and the location shall not be modified. 
(4)  The maximum area of a digital billboard sign face and display area shall not exceed three hundred (300) square feet with a maximum length of thirty (30) feet. 
(5)  No digital billboard may be located on top of, cantilevered over, or otherwise suspended above any building or structure. 
(6)  'Smart' billboards shall not be permitted that utilize technology or advanced features beyond digital LED signs employing the use of still images without the prior consideration and approval of the board of aldermen (e.g. mobile marketing via text message or SMS messaging, moving video displays, use of sound effects, cameras, radar, infrared, etc.).

B.  If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classifications. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.

J.  Any mobilehome located in a district other than a mobilehome park district from and after the effective date of this title shall be considered as a nonconforming use of the land under the provisions of this title; provided, however, that the replacement of a mobilehome with a newer or improved model mobilehome by an owner occupying the existing mobilehome under the provisions of the special use regulations of Section 17.56.030 shall not be considered such a change so as to alter the preexisting nonconforming use. It is further provided that the owner referred to hereinabove shall have occupied the existing mobilehome for a period of no less than twelve (12) months preceding the filing of the application for the special use permit required hereunder.

Chapter 17.64 - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 
Sections: 

17.64.010 - Site plan review. 
A.  The purpose of a site plan review is to ensure that the design and layout of certain developments permitted will constitute suitable development and will not result in a detriment to the neighborhood or the environment. All proposals for condominium units are subject to the provisions of this section, and no condominiums shall be erected or externally enlarged except in conformity with a site plan bearing an endorsement of approval from the board of aldermen. 
B.  All applications for site plan review shall be made and processed in the same manner as provided for zoning amendments in Section 17.64.040. An applicant for site plan review shall file a copy of an application form and a site plan with the board of aldermen. Unless this requirement is waived by the board of aldermen, the site plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer or architect. The site plan shall include and be accompanied by the following items and information: 
1.  The site plan shall show all existing and proposed buildings, existing and proposed contour elevations, structures, parking spaces, driveway openings, driveways, service areas, facilities for sewage, refuse and other waste disposal and for surface water drainage, and landscape features, such as fences, walls, planting areas, walks and lighting, both existing and proposed. The site plan shall also show the relation of the above features to adjacent ways and properties. The site plan shall also show all contiguous land owned by the applicant or by the owner of the property which is the subject of the application. 
2.  The applicant shall submit such material as may be required regarding design features to integrate the proposed development into the existing landscape, to enhance aesthetic assets and to screen objectionable features from neighbors. 
3.  The applicant shall submit such material as may be required regarding the projected traffic flow patterns into and upon the site for both vehicles and pedestrians, and an estimate of the projected number of motor vehicle trips to and from the site for an average day. 
(Ord. 3637 § 3, 1998; prior code § 29-22) 
17.64.020 - Enforcement. 
A.  It is the duty of the person designated by the mayor as building official to administer and enforce the regulations contained in this title. 
B.  It is unlawful to commence or proceed with the erection, construction, reconstruction, conversion, alteration, enlargement, extension, raising or moving of any building or structure, or of any portion thereof, without first having applied in writing to the building official for a building permit to do so, and until a building permit has been granted therefor. 
(Prior code § 29-23) 
17.64.030 - Zoning board of adjustment. 
A.  A board of adjustment is created. The word "board" when used in this section, shall be construed to mean the board of adjustment. The board shall consist of five members, who shall be residents of the city, appointed by the mayor and approved by the board of aldermen, each to be appointed for a term of five years; excepting that, when the board shall first be created, one member shall be appointed for a term of five years, one for a term of four years, one for a term of three years, one for a term of two years and one for a term of one year. Three alternate members may be appointed to serve in the absence or disqualification of the regular members. All members and alternates shall be removable for cause by the mayor and board of aldermen upon written charges and after a public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term only of any member whose term becomes vacant. The board shall elect its own chairman and vice chairman who shall serve for one year. 
B.  The board of adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of its business, establish a quorum and procedure and keep a public record of all findings, decisions and minutes of its meetings. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine, and all meetings shall be open to the public. Any meeting at which an appeal is to be heard shall be a public meeting with public notice of such meeting and business to be carried or published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least one time, seven days prior to the meeting, as well as due notice to the parties in interest. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The chairman, or in his absence, the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
C.  An appeal may be taken to the board of adjustment by any person, group or organization, public or private, affected by a decision of the zoning administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within such time as prescribed by the board by general rule by filing with the zoning administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. A fee of forty dollars ($40.00) shall accompany all notices of appeals. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
D.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application or notice to the zoning administrator and on due cause shown. 
E.  The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
1.  To hear and decide appeals, where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decisions or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement of this chapter, and may affirm or reverse, in whole or part, the decision of the zoning administrator; 
2.  To hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under the provisions of this title; 
3.  To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of the zoning ordinance in instances where strict enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause undue hardship, due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the provisions of the zoning ordinance. The board of adjustment shall not permit, as a variance, any use in a district that is not permitted under this title. The board of adjustment may impose conditions in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent property; 
4.  To hold public hearings on and decide the following exceptions to or variations of this chapter: 
a.  To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line thereof divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of the adoption of this title, 
b.  Interpret the provisions of this title in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the zoning district map, where the street layout on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on this map, 
c.  Permit reconstruction of a nonconforming building otherwise prohibited by Section 17.56.020, 
d.  Vary the yard regulations where there is an exceptional or unusual physical condition of a lot, not generally prevalent in the neighborhood, which condition, when related to the yard regulations of this chapter, would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of buildings on the lot, 
e.  Vary the parking regulations by not more than fifty (50) percent, where it is conclusively shown that the specific use of a building would make unnecessary the parking spaces otherwise required by this title, or where it can be conclusively shown that adequate off-street parking to serve a particular use has been provided by or is controlled by the municipality. 
F.  In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board of adjustment may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the zoning administrator. In considering all appeals to the provisions of this title, the board shall, before making any finding in a specific case, first determine that the proposed change will not constitute a change in the zoning district map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property; or increase congestion in public streets; or increase the danger of fire; or materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area; or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the city. Every change granted or denied by the board shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact, specifying the reason for granting or denying the variation. The decision of the board shall be made a part of any building permit in which the variation is allowed. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the zoning administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter or to effect any variation in this title. 
G.  Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality, may present to the circuit clerk of Perry County a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board of adjustment. Upon presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of adjustment to review such decision of the board of adjustment and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return thereto must be made and served upon the relator's attorney, which shall not be less than ten days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to the board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order. The board of adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof, or of such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and materials to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified. If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take additional evidence, or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct, and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which a determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. Costs shall not be allowed against the board, unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence, or in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from. 
(Ord. 4592 § 2, 2004; Ord. 3658 § 12, 1998; prior code § 29-24) 
17.64.035 - Employees not to serve on zoning board of adjustment. 
    No person who is a non-elected full-time or part-time employee of the city shall be appointed to or serve on the zoning board of adjustment. 
(Ord. No. 6054 , § 5, 7-3-18) 
17.64.040 - Amendments. 
A.  The board of aldermen may, by ordinance on its own motion or on application, amend, supplement, change, modify or repeal the boundaries or zoning designation of districts established in this chapter, under the procedures provided in this chapter and following referral thereof to the planning and zoning commission in accordance with this section. 
B.  Applications for district changes shall be filed in writing with the city clerk who shall place the application before the board of aldermen after determining that it is in proper form as provided in this chapter. All applications, except those proposed by the board of aldermen or the city planning and zoning commission, shall be accompanied by a publication fee and postage fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) which is to be returned to the applicant only if such publication is not made. A copy of the application shall remain on file with the city clerk for public inspection until final action thereon. 
C.  The board of aldermen or the city planning and zoning commission may provide forms for applications and may require applicants to provide plats and other documents or other information it may determine to be of value in acting upon the application. The board and planning commission may request the opinions and recommendations of other city boards and officers upon applications. 
D.  Upon receipt of an application in proper form, the board of aldermen shall refer it to the planning and zoning commission. The board of aldermen may, by resolution, delegate the duty of such receipt and referral to the city administrator or similar official. The planning and zoning commission shall return the application to the board of aldermen with its recommendations relating thereto, and showing the number of votes for and against its action, and may include a summary of the reasons expressed for and in opposition thereto. The board of aldermen may set a date by which the recommendation shall be returned, no less than twenty (20) days from the date of such setting, and the board of aldermen may proceed without receipt of such recommendations in the absence of receipt by such date. 
E.  The board of aldermen may reject an application without referring it to the planning and zoning commission and without publishing a notice of hearing if the application is made within two years of the board's rejection of a previous application seeking an amendment for the same or a larger or smaller included tract. 
F.  If the planning and zoning commission recommends approval of an application in whole or in part, the board of aldermen shall set a public hearing, as provided in this section. If the planning and zoning commission recommends rejection of an application in full, the board of aldermen may set a public hearing, as provided in this section, upon its own motion; or the board of aldermen may, by motion, file such recommendation of rejection; and the application shall thereupon be deemed rejected, unless, within ten days from such filing, the applicant files a written request with the city clerk for a public hearing under this section or makes an oral request therefor at a regular or special meeting of the board of aldermen, whereupon the board of aldermen shall set such a public hearing. If the board of aldermen fails to approve an application in whole or in part within thirty-five (35) days after the public hearing, such application shall be deemed to have been rejected in full, unless the board of aldermen shall have expressly extended such time period prior to the expiration thereof. 
G.  The board of aldermen may, by ordinance on its own motion or application, amend, supplement, change, modify or repeal the regulations or restrictions of districts established in this chapter, following the referral thereof to the planning and zoning commission, as provided in subsection D of this section. 
H.  No amendment, supplement or change of the regulations or restrictions or boundaries of districts shall become effective until after the board of aldermen has held a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The board of aldermen may provide for the posting of notices of the hearing on the tract and for other means of notifying the public or interested persons of the proceedings. 
I.  In case of an adverse report by the city planning and zoning commission, or if a protest against such proposed amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal shall be presented in writing to the city clerk, duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of thirty (30) percent or more, either of the areas of land (exclusive of streets and alleys) included within such proposed change, or within an area determined by lines drawn parallel to and one hundred eighty-five (185) feet distant from the boundaries of the district proposed to be changed, such amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the members of the board of aldermen. 
J.  In its action upon an application for change in district boundaries, the board of aldermen may grant a special use permit under Section 17.56.030, rather than the requested change in district boundaries, or may grant a change to a district which is intermediate in restrictiveness between the existing district and the requested district. However, no special use permit or change in district of this nature shall be granted, until the parties in interest have been notified by either public notice or certified mail that such permit or change is contemplated. 
(Ord. 4592 § 3, 2004; prior code § 29-25) 
(Ord. No. 5765, § 1, 6-7-16) 
17.64.050 - Violation-Penalty.

Any such person, having been served with an order to remove any such violation, failing to comply with the order within ten days after such notice, or continuing to violate any provision of the regulations made under authority of this title in the respect named in such order, shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
