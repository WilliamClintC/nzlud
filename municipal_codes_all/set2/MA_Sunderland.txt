§ 31-1. Title; statutory authority.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Personnel Bylaws" and is hereby adopted pursuant to
the provisions of MGL c. 41, § 108A.
§ 31-2. Disclaimers.
All individuals employed by the Town are employed "at will," and the employment relationship may
be terminated by either party at any time with or without cause and with or without notice.
Only the Board of Selectmen is authorized to create an employment contract, and that a signed
and written agreement is required to do so. The final interpretation of the provisions of the
Personnel Bylaws is the exclusive responsibility of the Board of Selectmen.
The provisions of the Personnel Bylaws, developed or disseminated by the Town, are designed
and intended to provide guidance and information and do not create an employment contract or
other employment obligation for the Town.
The Personnel Bylaws of the Town of Sunderland summarize the current benefits plans
maintained by the Town. If any questions arise regarding the interpretation of these plans, the
answers will be determined by reference to the actual plan documents, policies or governing
statutes rather than the summaries contained in these Bylaws.
§ 31-3. Nonharassment policy.
It is the policy of the Town of Sunderland to prohibit harassment of one (1) employee by another
employee or supervisor on any basis, including, but not limited to, race, color, religious creed,
national origin, gender, sexual orientation, ancestry, mental or physical disability.
The purpose of this policy is not to regulate the Town's employees' personal morality. Rather, it is
to assure that, in the workplace, no employee harasses another on any of these bases.
While it is not easy to define precisely what any of these bases are, they certainly include slurs,
epithets, threats, derogatory comments or visual depiction, unwelcome jokes, teasing, sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors and other similar verbal or physical contact.
Any employee who feels that he/she is a victim of harassment should immediately follow the
procedures set forth in the Town of Sunderland Anti-Harassment Policy and Complaint
Procedures. Violations of the Anti-Harassment policy will not be permitted and may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

§ 31-22. COBRA rights.
On April 7, 1986, a federal law was enacted (Public Law 99-272, Title X) requiring that most
employers sponsoring group medical plans offer employees and their families the opportunity for
temporary extension of medical coverage (called "continuation coverage") at a group rate in
certain instances where coverage under the plan would end.
As an employee of the Town, you have the right to choose this continuation coverage if you lose
your group medical coverage because of a reduction in your hours of employment or termination
of your employment (for any reason other than gross misconduct on your part).
Under the law, the employee or family member (to include divorced spouse or dependent child)
has the responsibility to inform the Town Treasurer, the Town's group health plan administrator of
a divorce, legal separation or a child losing dependent status under the Town's medical insurance
plan.
The Town has the responsibility to notify the insurance company's plan administrator of the
employee's death, termination of employment or reduction in hours, or Medicare entitlement.
When the insurance company's plan administrator is notified that one of the above-referenced
events has happened, the insurance company's plan administrator will in turn notify you that you
have the right to choose continuation coverage. Under the law, you have at least sixty (60) days
from the date you would lose coverage because of the events described above to inform the
insurance company's plan administrator that you want continuation coverage.
If you do not choose continuation coverage, your group medical insurance coverage will end.
If you choose continuation coverage, the Town is required to give you coverage which, as of the
time coverage is being provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly
situated employees or family members. The law requires that you be afforded the opportunity to
maintain continuation coverage for thirty-six (36) months unless you lost group medical coverage

because of termination of employment or reduction in hours. In that case, the required
continuation coverage period is eighteen (18) months.
Under the law, you may have to pay part or all of the premium for your continuation coverage. The
law also says that, at the end of the eighteen-month or thirty-six-month continuation coverage
period, you may be allowed to enroll in an individual conversion medical plan provided under the
Town medical insurance plan.

the new job is suitable for him/her and the Department Head will have opportunity to evaluate
the employee's conduct, performance and work habits. Probationary employees shall have no
rights to contest the termination of their employment during the probationary period. An
employee separated during the probationary period may be terminated without cause and
without notice and shall not have recourse to the grievance procedure.
Probationary employees shall receive a written appraisal of their performance after the initial
ninety (90) days of their employment by their Department Head or their Department Head's
designee.

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY CONSERVATION CODE (IECC)
The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) is a building energy code created by the
International Code Council. It is a model code adopted by many state and municipal governments
in the United States for the establishment of minimum design and construction requirements for
energy efficiency and is updated on a three year cycle. Since July 1, 2010, the baseline energy
conservation requirements of the MA State Building Code defaulted to the latest published edition,
currently the IECC 2009, with Massachusetts amendments as approved by the Board of Building
Regulations and Standards.
STRETCH ENERGY CODE
Codified by the Board of Building Regulations and Standards as 780 CMR Appendix 115.AA of the

Conservation Code (IECC) to improve energy efficiency of buildings built to this code.
§ 46-2. Purpose.
The purpose of the Stretch Code, 780 CMR 115.AA, is to provide a more energy efficient alternative to
the base energy code applicable to the relevant sections of the building code for both new construction
and existing buildings.
§ 46-3. Applicability.
The Stretch Code applies to residential and commercial buildings. Buildings not included in this scope
shall comply with 780 CMR 13, 34, 561, or 93, as applicable.
§ 46-4. Authority.
A municipality seeking to ensure that construction within its boundaries is designed and built
above the energy efficiency requirements of 780 CMR may mandate adherence to this appendix.
780 CMR 115.AA may be adopted or rescinded by any municipality in the Commonwealth in the
manner prescribed by law.
§ 46-5. Stretch Code.
The Stretch Code, as codified by the Board of Building Regulations and Standards as 780 CMR
Appendix 115.AA, including any future editions, amendments or modifications, is herein
incorporated by reference into the Town of Sunderland General Bylaws, Chapter 46.
The Stretch Code shall be enforced by the inspector of buildings or building commissioner.

A.
B.
The right to farm is hereby recognized to exist within the Town of Sunderland. The above-described
agricultural activities may occur on holidays, weekdays, and weekends by night or day and shall
include the attendant incidental noise, odors, dust, and fumes associated with normally accepted
agricultural practices. It is hereby determined that whatever impact may be caused to others through
the normal practice of agriculture is more than offset by the benefits of farming to the neighborhood,
community, and society in general. The benefits and protections of this bylaw are intended to apply
exclusively to those commercial agricultural and farming operations and activities conducted in
accordance with generally accepted agricultural practices. For any agricultural practice, in determining
the reasonableness of the time, place, and methodology of such practice, consideration shall be given
to both traditional customs and procedures as well as to new practices and innovations. Moreover,
nothing in this Right to Farm Bylaw shall be deemed as acquiring any interest in land. The protections
contained in this bylaw do not supersede any applicable zoning or legal restrictions associated with
agricultural operations or other local, state or federal laws or regulations.
§ 58-4. Notification to residents and real estate buyers.
In order to promote harmony between farmers and their neighbors, residents shall be notified by
the Town as set forth below and buyers and occupants shall be notified by landholders and/or their
agents (and assigns) prior to the sale or exchange of real property, or prior to the acquisition of a
leasehold interest or other possessory interest in real property, through written notification, as
follows:
"It is the policy of the Town of Sunderland to conserve, protect, and encourage the maintenance
and improvement of agricultural land for the production of food and other agricultural products,
and also for its natural and ecological value. This disclosure notification is to inform residents and
buyers that the property they occupy or are about to acquire or occupy lies within a town where
farming activities occur. Such farming activities (which may occur on holidays, weekdays, and
weekends by night or day) may include, but are not limited to, activities that cause noise, dust
and odors. Occupying land within Sunderland means that one should expect and accept such
conditions as a normal and necessary aspect of living in such an area. Buyers or occupants are
also informed that the location of property within the Town may be impacted by commercial
agricultural operations."
A copy of the above notification shall be posted in the Town Hall, and at any other location at the
Board of Selectmen's sole discretion. The notification shall also be available for distribution upon
request in the offices of the Board of Selectmen, Board of Assessors, and the Town Clerk. A copy
of the notification shall be included in the Town's Annual Report and may, at the Board of
Selectmen's sole discretion, be mailed to all Town residents from time to time.
§ 58-5. Resolution of complaints.
Any person having a complaint about a farm or farming activity or practice is encouraged to seek an
amicable resolution to the complaint, including talking directly with the involved farmer. Such person
may, notwithstanding pursuing any other available remedy, request resolution assistance from the
Board of Selectmen. Such a request does not suspend the time within which to pursue any other
available remedies. The Board of Selectmen may, at its sole discretion and to the extent the Board
believes resolution of the matter may be facilitated by involvement of the Town, appoint a panel of at
least three individuals, to include representation from farmers, or refer such request to a Sunderland
Agricultural Commission, should one exist, or other appropriate board or officer. Said panel,
Agricultural Commission or board or officer shall review and facilitate the resolution of such a request
and report its recommendations to the Board of Selectmen within the agreed-upon time frame.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, however, the Board of Selectmen shall not be
required to forward a complaint filed in accordance herewith or to take any other action whatsoever

used continuously on a year-round basis, such as access for agriculture, forestry and other uses, must
apply for a permit under this article but may, in addition, apply for a waiver of the standards set forth in
§ 106-7.

which are the subject of the application are likely to have a significant or cumulative detrimental
effect upon the wetland values protected by this chapter, the Commission, within twenty-one (21)
days of the close of the hearing, shall issue or deny a permit for the activities requested. If it
issues a permit, the Commission shall impose conditions which the Commission deems necessary
or desirable to protect those values, and all activities shall be done in accordance with those
conditions.

chapter, for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the Commission, for
failure to meet the design specification, performance standards and other requirements and
regulations of the Commission, for failure to avoid or prevent significant or cumulative detrimental
effects upon the wetland values protected by this chapter and where no conditions are adequate
to protect those values.

application issued under this chapter with the order of conditions or other action issued or taken
under the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40.

Nonconforming Uses and Structures - Any use or structure not conforming with this Zoning Bylaw
may be continued if the use or structure was lawfully existing at the time it became
nonconforming, subject to the following:
[Amended 4-28-1989 ATM, Art. 21; 4-26-1996 ATM, Art. 32; 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1]
Alteration, extension or change - As provided in the MGL c. 40A, § 6, a nonconforming singleor
two-family dwelling may be altered or extended, only if the Inspector of Buildings
determines that doing so does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure.

Bylaw including the requirements of § 125-Article VI-3, Special Permits. In the Watershed
District, the Zoning Board of Appeals must also find that such an extension or alteration does
not increase the danger of groundwater pollution or contamination.
Loss of nonconforming status - A nonconformity which has been changed to a conformity or
has been abandoned or discontinued for a period of two (2) years [five (5) years for
agriculture, horticulture or floriculture] shall not be reestablished.
Restoration - Any legally nonconforming structure may be reconstructed if destroyed by fire or
other accidental or natural cause if reconstruction is begun within twelve (12) months and
completed within twenty-four (24) months from the date of the catastrophe, and provided that
such restoration or reconstruction shall not exceed the floor area of the original
nonconforming structure.
[Editor's Note: Former Subsection E, regarding special permits for two-family dwelling, as
added 4-27-1984 ATM, Art. 23, which followed this subsection, was repealed 11-29-1999
STM, Art. 1. Said amendment also provided for the renumbering of former Subsection F as
Subsection E.]
Structure Conversion - In order to conserve the existing character of the Town and previous
resource investment, a structure in existence April 29, 1978 (whether or not in a major residential
development), may be granted a special permit for conversion to two-family or multifamily use in
districts where allowed under § 125-Article II-2, Use Regulations, provided that Subsections E(1)
through (8) of this subsection are complied with as well as the Special Permit requirements of
§ 125-Article VI-3, Special Permits.
[Added 4-13-1993 STM, Art. 45; amended 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1]
[Editor's Note: this section replaced former § 125-15, Structure conversion, amended 4-24-1981
ATM, Art. 19, and 4-24-1987 ATM, Art. 32, which was repealed 4-13-1993 STM, Art. 45.]
To be eligible for conversion, the structure must be located in compliance with current side
and rear and front yard requirements and must not exceed current height limitations except
that single-family homes in the Village Residential and Village Center Districts shall not be
required to meet current side and rear and front yard requirements or height limitations. (See
§ 125-Article II-3-E, Dimensional Schedule)
[Amended 4-28-1995 ATM, Art. 30]
Lot area must be not less than the minimum required under § 125-Article II-3-E, Dimensional
Schedule, for a single-family dwelling at that location, plus fifty percent (50%) of that required
area for each dwelling unit in excess of one (1).
[Amended 4-28-1995 ATM, Art. 30]
The added dwelling units must be served by the Town sewerage system or by a new on-site
disposal system meeting the requirements of Title 5 of the State Environmental Code.
No addition or extension to the principal structure shall be made.
Parking requirements of § 125-Article III-1, Parking and Loading Requirements, shall be
strictly observed. No parking space shall block egress from another parking space.
Each dwelling unit shall meet all requirements of the State Building Code and of Article II of
the State Sanitary Code.
The safety, convenience and amenity of the dwellings shall be, in the judgment of the Board
of Appeals, equal or superior to that characteristic of new multifamily housing in the region.
No additional exterior entrances shall be created if visible from a street.

§ 125-II-3. Dimensional Requirements.
General.
No structure shall be erected or used, premises used or lot changed in size or shape except
in conformity with the requirements of this section, unless exempted by this Zoning Bylaw or
by statute (see especially MGL c. 40A, § 6). Any increase in lot area, frontage, yard or
coverage requirements of this Zoning Bylaw shall not apply to the erection, extension,
alteration or moving of a structure on a legally created lot not meeting current requirements,
provided that the applicant documents that:
At the time such increased requirement became applicable to it, the lot:
Had at least five thousand (5,000) square feet of lot area and fifty (50) feet of
frontage on a street;
Was held in ownership separate from all other lots having frontage within one
thousand (1,000) feet on that same street; and
Conformed to then-existing dimensional requirements.
The lot is not to be used for multifamily, hotel, motel or campground use.
Such nonconforming lots may be changed in size or shape or their land area recombined
without losing this exemption, so long as the change does not increase the actual or potential
number of buildable lots.
Principal Building - Not more than one (1) dwelling or principal building shall be erected on a lot in
any district, except as follows. There may be more than one (1) principal building on a lot in the
Village Center or C-1 Commercial Districts provided that a special permit is granted in accordance
with the requirements of § 125-Article IV-3, Planned Unit Development Overlay District. There may
be more than one (1) principal building on a lot in any district as long as each building is a
municipal use.
[Amended 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1; 4-28-2000 ATM, Art. 48; 4-29-2002 ATM, Art. 29; 4-29-2005

ATM, Art. 21; 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1]
The area of said lot is at least double the minimum area normally required for the district.
A building envelope is designated on the plan, identifying the area where the principal building
will be located. The width of the lot where the building envelope is located must equal or
exceed the number of feet normally required for street frontage.
Lot width is at no point less than forty (40) feet, and lot frontage is not less than forty (40) feet.
Rear lots shall be permitted in the Watershed District only if there is access to public sewer.

Increase by fifty percent (50%) for two-family units, increase by 100% for a dwelling
containing 3 dwelling units and 150% for a dwelling containing 4 dwelling units. For
example in the VR District the minimum lot area would be: 30,000 sq. ft. for a Two-Family
Dwelling; 40,000 sq. ft. for a dwelling with 3 dwelling units; and 50,000 sq. ft. for a dwelling
with 4 dwelling units.
Increase to thirty-five (35) feet for commercial use when abutting a residential district.
Increase to one hundred forty (140) feet for two (2) or more dwelling units on a lot.
Along a public way with a width of fifty (50) feet or less, the minimum setback shall be fiftyfive
(55) feet from the center line of the public way.
Increase to three (3) acres minimum lot area and two hundred (200) feet minimum frontage
for the Watershed District, except that lots within the Watershed District having two
hundred (200) feet of frontage on Route 116, Bull Hill Road or East Plumtree Road shall be
permitted with a minimum lot size of thirty-two thousand (32,000) square feet.
The width of the lot where the principal structure is to be built shall not be less than the
minimum frontage requirement for a lot, other than a rear lot, in such district.
Increase to two (2) acres the minimum lot area and to two hundred (feet) the minimum lot
frontage for the Prime Agricultural and Critical Resource Overlay Districts.
Increased to 75 feet on front, side and rear yards for Large-Scale Ground-Mounted Solar
Electric Installations.
Decreased to 15 feet for any component of a Large-Scale Ground-Mounted Solar Electric
Installation.
Decrease to 10 feet, with a "one to one" rule for accessory structures between 10 and 20

Purpose - Special resource districts are the Prime Agricultural District, the Critical Resource
District and the Watershed District. The purpose of special resource district provisions is to ensure
that lands critical to the environmental quality of the Town of Sunderland not be physically
developed prior to consideration of alternatives to such development. The Prime Agricultural,
Critical Resource and Watershed Districts, as shown on the Zoning Map, shall be considered to be
superimposed over any other district established in this Zoning Bylaw.
Regulations - Land in any special resource district may be used as otherwise permitted in the
underlying district, subject to the following:
New buildings or structures or excavation, dredging or filling of land shall be allowed within
the Critical Resource District only upon approval of a special permit by the Planning Board
and only if in conformity with the requirements of the underlying district. However, additions,
alterations and land excavation and filling incidental to an existing residential use shall not be
subject to the special permit requirement. Accompanying the application for such permit shall
be three (3) copies of a report prepared by the applicant, in detail commensurate with the
scale of the proposed undertaking, outlining the effect of the proposed action upon the
environment. Such report shall consider, where germane, surface and ground water
hydrology, water quality, soil erosion or stability, natural habitats, scenic or historic environs
and other environmental considerations. Copies of the application and the report shall be
transmitted to the Conservation Commission by the Town Clerk within seven (7) days of the
filing of the application. The Planning Board shall not act upon the application until receipt of
recommendations from the Conservation Commission, unless thirty-five (35) days elapse
following receipt of the application materials without receipt of such recommendations.
Major residential developments within the Watershed District, Critical Resource District, or
Prime Agricultural District shall be allowed only upon approval of a special permit by the
Planning Board and only if in conformity with the requirements of the underlying district.
Accompanying the application for such permit shall be three (3) copies of a report prepared
by the applicant, in detail commensurate with the scale of the proposed undertaking, outlining
the effect of the proposed action upon the environment. Such report shall consider, where
germane, surface and ground water hydrology, water quality, soil erosion or stability, natural
habitats, scenic or historic environs and other environmental considerations. Copies of the
application and the report shall be transmitted to the Conservation Commission by the Town
Clerk within seven (7) days of the filing of the application. The Planning Board shall not act
upon the application until receipt of recommendations from the Conservation Commission,
unless thirty-five (35) days elapse following receipt of the application materials without receipt
of such recommendations. In acting on major residential development proposals, if the
Planning Board determines that neither the basic development proposal before it nor any
submitted alternatives can adequately protect agricultural activity, scenic views, habitats,
fragile natural environments or other critical environmental resources, it may grant a special
permit only upon the determination that nondevelopment alternatives for utilization of site
value have been reasonably pursued and found to be infeasible, including transfer of
development rights or sale of land or rights to other organizations having land preservation
purposes.
[Amended 4-29-2011 ATM, Art. 7]
With respect to a special permit application in a Special Resource District, the Planning Board
shall take one (1) of the following actions:
If the Planning Board finds that the proposal is consistent with the purpose and all other
requirements of this Zoning Bylaw, and with the resource character of the land, the
Planning Board may grant a special permit without stipulation and no waiting period is
required.

If the Planning Board finds that the proposal is inconsistent with the purpose and one (1)
or more of the requirements of this Zoning Bylaw, but measures can be taken to mitigate
adverse impacts, then a special permit may be granted which stipulates conditions to
mitigate adverse impacts to the resource area. In addition, a waiting period of one
hundred twenty (120) days is required for all major residential development proposals in
any Special Resource District and ninety (90) days for all other uses in the Critical
Resource District. The waiting period shall start on the date the special permit is granted,
during which time no excavation, dredging or filling of land and no erection of a building
or structure shall take place. For major residential development proposals or any action
within the Critical Resource District, the Town will have the opportunity to take a
proposal(s) to Town Meeting(s) to acquire part or all of the premises in question or for
acquisition of rights to protect the premises, during the required waiting period.
If the Planning Board finds the proposal inconsistent with the purpose and requirements
of this Zoning Bylaw, it may deny the request for a special permit.
Land within a Special Resource District may be used to earn Development Unit Credits
(DUCs) for development to be located outside the district through transferring of development
rights.
Watershed District.
[Editor's Note: The 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1, provided for the renumbering of former § 125-16.2,
Watershed District (added 4-28-1989 ATM, Art. 21, and amended 4-28-1995 ATM, Art. 28), as
this section.]
Additional purposes - Additional purposes of the Watershed District are to protect the health,
safety and general welfare of Sunderland residents by protecting and preserving groundwater
and surface water resources in Town, and by protecting the community from any use of land
or buildings which may pollute, contaminate or otherwise adversely affect its drinking water
resources. For any proposed development in the Watershed District, a site plan prepared in
accordance with § 125-Article VI-1-B, Site Plan Review, shall be submitted to the Planning
Board and Water Commissioners, with the following information where applicable:
[Amended 4-29-2011 ATM, Art. 7]
A complete list of chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, fuels, and other potentially
hazardous materials to be used or stored on the premises in quantities greater than
those associated with normal household use;
For those activities using or storing such hazardous materials, a hazardous materials
management plan shall be prepared and submitted to the Fire Chief, Water
Commissioners, and Board of Health for review and comment. The plan shall include:
Provisions to protect against the discharge of hazardous materials or wastes to the
environment due to spillage, accidental damage, corrosion, leakage, or vandalism,
including spill containment and clean-up procedures;
Provisions for indoor, secured storage of hazardous materials and wastes with
impervious floor surfaces;
Evidence of compliance with the Massachusetts Hazardous Waste Regulations 310
CMR 30.000; and
Proposed down-gradient location(s) for groundwater monitoring well(s) should the
Planning Board deem the activity a potential groundwater threat.
Additional regulations - The Watershed District is an overlay district and shall be

to or within a residential or Village Center District, no use will be allowed which causes sound,
noise, vibration, odor or flashing perceptible without instruments beyond the boundaries of the
originating premises. However, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a special permit for gravel
mining operations not meeting these standards in cases where the Zoning Board of Appeals
determines that no objectionable conditions are thereby created for the use of other affected
properties and provided that a plan is cooperatively developed between the applicant and any
affected abutters that addresses hours of operation, protection of groundwater, exterior lighting,
storage of hazardous materials, landscaping and berms to reduce noise, and phasing and
reclamation standards. If a plan cannot be cooperatively developed between the applicant and the
affected abutters, the Zoning Board of Appeals may develop a plan, which is acceptable to itself,
that addresses hours of operation, protection of groundwater, exterior lighting, storage of
hazardous materials, landscaping and berms to reduce noise, and phasing and reclamation
standards.

plots providing not less than forty (40) square feet of unpaved soil area per tree. The interior
of parking lots with more than twelve (12) spaces shall be landscaped to provide shade and
visual relief by planting at least one shade tree in a curbed soil plot or peninsula for each six
(6) parking spaces. For example a parking lot containing twelve (12) parking spaces would
have at least two (2) trees planted within the interior and one tree planted on the perimeter,
for a total of at least three trees. See also § 125-Article-III-1, Parking and Loading
Requirements.
[Amended 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1; 4-29-2005 ATM, Art. 28]
All outdoor sales display areas and all commercial outdoor recreation must be screened from
any adjacent residential use or district by a wall, fence or densely planted evergreen trees or

[Editor's Note: This section was formerly Subsection G of § 125-Article II-3, Dimensional
Requirements. Subsection numbering has been changed accordingly.]
Applicability - A flexible development may be created with site plan approval from the Planning
Board in accordance with the requirements of § 125-Article VI-1-B, Site Plan Review, to divide a
parcel using alternative area, frontage and other requirements as follows:
Lot Frontage - Individual lot frontage may be a minimum of one hundred (100) feet.
Lot Size - Individual lot area in the RR and C-1 Districts may be as little as 20,000 square feet.
Area of individual lots in a VR and VC Districts may be as little as 10,000 square feet. One singleor
two-family home may be placed on each lot.
Number of Lots - The total number of building lots created from any parcel shall be no larger than
the number which could be built upon in compliance with § 125-Article II-3-E, Dimensional
Schedule, and all other applicable subdivision and health requirements unless a density bonus is
granted pursuant to § 125-Article IV-1-H, Bonus Lots. No further increase in the number of lots
shall be allowed through subsequent land division.
Criteria for Approval - The plan creating the lots shall be endorsed by the Planning Board as
"Approved for Flexible Development" if two (2) or more of the following objectives are met:
Natural site features, including watercourses, floodplains, water bodies, wetlands, scenic
points and historic sites, are preserved.
Dwelling units are integrated into the existing landscape through the placement of buildings
within woodlands, along edges of fields, or at locations visually screened by natural
vegetation or topographic features particularly as viewed from the roadside.

A majority of any prime farmland soils existing on the site is permanently protected from
development.
The architectural features of the homes are consistent with the historic character of existing
homes in the neighborhood in term of roof pitch, building materials (e.g., wood clapboards,
brick, stone), and window treatments.
Affordable Housing - At least 20% of the housing lots shall contain affordable housing units.
Open Space - At least forty percent (40%) of the total parcel shall be permanently protected as
agricultural, forested land, or other open space ("protected open space"). The minimum required
protected open space shall not include wetlands and related resource areas, water bodies, all
areas with slopes of 25% or greater, one-hundred-year floodplains, existing permanently protected
open space, and all other areas determined by the Board of Health to be unsuitable for on-site
sewage disposal ("land with environmental constraints"). To the extent possible, the preserved
land shall form a contiguous tract to enable continued farming or forestry operations. Land with
environmental constraints may be included in the protected open space subject to a conservation
restriction in perpetuity if it increases the amount of protected open space beyond the 40%
minimum amount (e.g., agricultural or forested land equals 40% of the total parcel plus land with
environmental constraints equals 10% of the total parcel resulting in protected open space of 50%
of the total parcel). The Planning Board may grant a waiver to reduce the minimum required
percentage of protected agriculture or forested land to thirty-five percent (35%) of the total parcel if
at least sixty percent (60%) of the total lot area is permanently protected and no more than twentyfive
percent (25%) of the total lot area is composed of wetlands and related resource areas,
floodplains, or land with slopes greater than 25%. Existing permanently protected open space,
roadways and accessory uses shall not count towards the sixty percent (60%) of permanently
protected open space. Any proposed open land, unless conveyed to the Town or its Conservation
Commission, shall be covered by a recorded restriction at the Registry of Deeds enforceable by
the Town, providing that such land shall be kept in an undeveloped state and any frontage on a
public way may not be used to meet future lot frontage requirements.
Bonus Lots - The Planning Board may approve a flexible development containing more than the
maximum number of lots allowed pursuant to § 125-Article II-3-E, Dimensional Schedule, in
accordance with the following "point incentive system." A development plan that meets any of the
following criteria will earn the number of points listed. Depending on the total number of points
earned, a developer may earn a bonus in the form of extra building lots allowed within the
development. The Planning Board will determine, upon review of the development plan, the bonus
point total. A development plan will earn points and a building lot bonus above the basic number of
building lots allowed under § 125-Article II-3-E, Dimensional Schedule, as follows:
Bonus Points Building Lot Bonus Example - 10-Lot Subdivision
40 10% 1 bonus lot - 1-2 dwellings
50 20% 2 bonus lots - 2-4 dwellings
60 30% 3 bonus lots - 3-6 dwellings
70+ 40% 4 bonus lots - 4-8 dwellings
If the point total results in a building lot bonus with a fractional part less than one-half (0.5), the
bonus building lot total will be rounded down to the next lowest whole number but not less than
one. Totals ending in .5 or greater shall be rounded up. For example, a 15-lot subdivision that
earns 40 bonus points would be eligible for 2 extra building lots as a bonus (15 x 0.10=1.5
rounded up to 2 bonus building lots). A 14-lot subdivision that earns 40 bonus points would be
eligible for 1 extra building lot (14*.10=1.4 rounded down to 1 bonus building lot). The total
number of bonus building lots under this section cannot exceed 40% of the maximum number of
building lots allowed before the addition of bonus units.

Any development that increases the amount of land permanently preserved by 5% above the
40% requirement earns 10 points. Each additional 5% increase in preserved land results in an
additional 10 points. Such land above the 40% minimum requirement may include land with
environmental constraints such as floodplains.
For protected farmland, sale of the farmland to a person or entity currently engaged in
farming, or lease of the farmland for five or more years to a person or entity engaged in
farming, and/or creation of a homeowners' association and dedicated resources to be
provided to that association for the establishment and maintenance of a community farm or
gardens, earns 10 points.
For protected forestland, a binding arrangement to ensure that the forest is managed in such
a way as to qualify for "green certification" by the Forest Stewardship Council or other
comparable organization acceptable to the Planning Board earns 10 points.
A flexible development plan that protects at least 10 acres of land in one contiguous tract
earns 5 points; a plan that protects at least 20 acres in one contiguous tract earns 10 points.
A flexible development plan that protects land of at least 5 acres in a tract that is contiguous
to an already protected area so as to increase the area of working agricultural land, forest, or
wildlife habitat earns 5 points.
For forestland, wetlands, water bodies or other natural areas supporting high-quality wildlife
habitat, implementation of a significant ecological restoration project earns 15 points.
Examples include: removal of a small dam or other barrier to aquatic organism passage,
replacement of a preexisting sub-standard stream culvert, restoration of eroding stream
banks, restoration of riparian areas, removal of non-native invasive species or mitigation of a
preexisting source of water pollution.
A development plan that screens structures from view from a public way as evidenced by
cross sections of the definitive plan at a scale of 1 inch = 10 feet earns 5 points or a planting
plan which includes sufficient trees and plantings to improve the visual character of the
development earns 5 points or if both are provided such plan can receive a total of 10 points.
Architectural designs for the single- or two-family structures that match the current character
of the area earn 10 points. Architectural elevation drawings of the single- or two-family homes
must accompany the site plan to be eligible to receive points in this category.
A development plan that provides recreational opportunities for residents of Sunderland by
providing access to walking trails or other passive forms of recreation via an easement will
earn 10 points.
If all houses are certified as Energy Star (or its equivalent) homes, 10 points will be earned (to
be secured by a covenant). Homes in a flexible development for senior housing pursuant to
§ 125-Article IV-1-H-(11) below will only receive 5 points.

At least 20% of the dwelling units must be available for rent or for sale, in perpetuity or for
the longest period allowed by law, via a deed restriction to seniors qualifying as low- or
moderate-income households as defined by the Department of Communities &
Development of the Commonwealth, and such units must count towards the 10%
requirement of Chapter 40B; and
At least 50% of the units must be handicapped accessible.
A development plan that guarantees that 30% or more of the housing lots will contain dwelling
units that meet the definition of affordable housing earns 10 points.
Design Process - When a flexible development plan is submitted, applicants shall be prepared to
demonstrate to the Planning Board that the following design process was used in determining the
layout of proposed streets, house lots, and contiguous open space.
Understanding the site. Inventory existing site features, taking care to identify sensitive and
noteworthy natural, scenic and cultural resources on the site, and to determine the connection
of these important features to each other.
Evaluating site context. Evaluate the site in its larger context by identifying physical (e.g.,
stream corridors, wetlands), transportation (e.g., road and bicycle networks), and cultural
(e.g., recreational opportunities) connections to surrounding land uses and activities.
Designating the protected open land. Identify the protected open land to be preserved on the
site. Such open space should include the most sensitive and noteworthy resources of the site,
and, where appropriate, areas that serve to extend neighborhood open space networks.
Locating development areas. Locate building sites, streets, parking areas, paths and other
built features of the development. The design should include a delineation of private yards,
public streets and other areas, and shared amenities, so as to reflect an integrated
community, with emphasis on consistency with the Town's historical development patterns.
Illustrating lot lines. Draw in the lot lines.
§ 125-IV-2. Major Residential Development.
[Amended 4-24-1987 ATM, Art. 32]
Applicability - A major residential development is the creation of more than four (4) lots, whether a
subdivision or not, or construction of more than four (4) dwelling units within a ten-year period from
or on a property or a set of contiguous properties in common ownership as of January 1, 1987. In
addition, smaller developments may, at the owner's option, be considered major residential
developments and employ the following provisions.

§ 125-IV-3. Planned Unit Development Overlay District.
[Added 4-29-2005 ATM, Art. 28]
Purpose - The Planned Unit Development Overlay District is designed to allow for planned unit
developments in designated areas of Town. Through a comprehensive site plan, a unified
development containing a mixture of land uses and buildings is developed as a single entity. It is
the intent of this provision to ensure sound planning and zoning practices while allowing certain
desirable departures from the strict provisions of specific zone classifications.
Encourage flexibility in the design of development through a carefully controlled review
process of particular plans within a particular zoning district.
Promote the use of multiple-story buildings and campus-like clustering of buildings to
maximize the amount of available open space.
Encourage a less sprawling form of development which makes more efficient use of land,
requires shorter networks of streets and utilities and which fosters more economical
development and less consumption of developable land.
Provide an efficient procedure which will ensure appropriate high-quality design and site
planning.
Promote high-quality coordinated building and site design which buffers adjacent residential
uses and protects both scenic and natural features.
Definition - Planned Unit Development: A development of land as a single entity under the
direction of a comprehensive site plan, in which a mixture of land uses, a variety of building types
and designs, and open space are provided for in a coherent manner.
District Location - The location of the Planned Unit Development Overlay District is defined as the
C-1 Commercial District and the VC Village Center District.
[Amended 4-27-2012 ATM, Art. 14]
Dimensional Requirements - To be eligible for a planned unit development, the parcel must have
at least 400 feet of frontage and have a minimum lot area of 80,000 square feet.
Use Regulations.
The uses allowed in a planned unit development are any uses allowed either by right or
special permit within the underlying zoning district.
Uses in a planned unit development shall comply with all other applicable sections of this
Bylaw, including but not limited to § 125-Article III-1, Parking and Loading Requirements, and
§ 125-Article III-2, Signs, in addition to the required provisions of this section.
More than one principal building and use is permitted on a lot.
A building height of 35 feet is permitted.
One or more separate but contiguous parcels may be assembled to create a planned unit
development. Proposed planned unit developments may include preexisting uses and
buildings provided they are integrated into the development plan. Planned unit developments
may consist of land in more than single ownership and may be subdivided into separate lots

provided all current and future owners and lots are bound by restrictive covenant(s) to the
planned development permit approvals and to maintain the project as a single planned unit
development. Subdivision of lots within a planned unit development after final approval of the
site plan shall be considered an amendment to the special permit and will require approval by
the Planning Board.
Access Requirements.
Entrances to planned unit developments shall be limited to one access point onto a public
way. The Planning Board may grant additional access points to improve traffic circulation if
deemed necessary.
Common driveways and parallel service drives may be required in the planned unit
development to consolidate driveway openings to a few widely spaced locations.
Utilities.
Planned unit developments shall be connected to the public water and sewer systems in
accordance with the standards and specifications of the Town.
All utility lines shall be placed underground where physically feasible.
Design Requirements.
Developments shall have an integrated design with respect to building placement, proportion,
color, rooflines, and other architectural details.
Developments must incorporate human scale features such as landscaping, pedestrian
plazas and other public spaces, first floor windows, pedestrian level lighting, benches,
awnings and architectural details.
The building's main entrance shall be clearly defined with architectural details such as raised
parapets, peaked roofs, arches, canopies, and overhangs.
Rear or side facades visible from other uses, parking areas, or streets must be of finished
quality and should be landscaped.
Parking areas shall be located to the side or rear of buildings to the maximum extent feasible.

pedestrian walkways.
Phasing Requirements - All applications for planned unit developments shall include sufficient
information to evaluate total build-out of the site. The Planning Board may permit a phased
schedule in accordance with an approved master site plan.
The initial construction phase shall provide sufficient on-site and off-site improvements to
adequately serve the constructed portion independent of future phases, encourage
completion of the build-out design, and minimize disruptions during future construction
phases. Improvements shall include but are not limited to driveways, parking, sewer, water,
stormwater systems, lighting, and landscaping. The Planning Board may permit phased
construction of improvements if deemed appropriate.
The applicant shall provide the Town with a performance guarantee to cover the costs of
construction of the on-site and off-site improvements, subject to approval from the Planning
Board, in the form of a performance bond, letter of credit, or cash escrow.
Any changes in use or amendments to subsequent development phases shall require
approval by the Planning Board. Modifications or extensions to an approved phasing
timetable shall not be considered substantive amendments.
Procedural Requirements - All planned unit developments require a special permit and site plan
review. The Planning Board shall be the Site Plan Approval Authority and Special Permit Granting
Authority for all planned unit developments in the Planned Unit Development Overlay District. A
special permit may be granted by the Planning Board for multiple uses allowed by right or by
special permit if the Planning Board finds that the proposed uses will not have adverse effects
which overbalance the beneficial effects according to the requirements and criteria of § 125-Article
VI-3, Special Permits. In addition to the site plan submittal requirements in § 125-Article VI-1-B,
Site Plan Review, and the special permit requirements section of § 125-Article VI-3, Special
Permits, of this Bylaw, site plans shall include:
Color renderings of facade elevations of all sides of all proposed new construction and
renovations including proposed mature landscaping.

[Added 4-27-1990 ATM, Art. 18]
Intent - The intent of the development rate limitation is to avoid large year-to-year variations in
development rate in Sunderland while allowing development consistent with historic average rates
and providing for the housing needs of all population groups.
Basic Requirements - Issuance of building permits authorizing creation of dwelling units through
construction, placement or conversion shall be allowed only under the priority procedures of
§ 125-Article IV-4-C, Development Priorities, unless exempted from them for one (1) or more of
the following reasons:
Individual applicant. This applicant has owned the lot as of October 21, 1993, and has not
been issued a building permit within the past twelve (12) months.
[Amended 10-21-1993 STM, Art. 17]
Special development. The Sunderland Planning Board has granted a special permit for rapid
development, upon its determination that the housing development would serve a critical
community need, such as low- and moderate-income housing, would be infeasible if subject
to the priority procedures and would not result in overburdened public services.
Protected development. The proposal is not subject to § 125-Article IV-4-C, Development
Priorities, because of the provisions of MGL c. 40A, § 6.
Approved subdivisions. Permits issued for dwellings to be constructed on lots within a
subdivision approved prior to the effective date of this section will not be counted in the
monthly or yearly quota.
Development Priorities.
Applications for building permits for construction of one (1) or more dwelling units, unless
exempted under Subsection B(1), (2) or (3) above, shall be examined for completeness, then
complete applications shall be accumulated and acted upon by the Building Inspector within
the first seven (7) days of each month.
Applications shall be granted monthly in order of the date of initial complete application, until
the quota for the bimonthly period has been reached. However, no one (1) applicant shall be
authorized more than two (2) dwelling units under this section within any twelve-month period
if doing so would result in denial for other applicants.
[Amended 10-21-1993 STM, Art. 17]
The bimonthly quota shall equal three (3) dwelling units minus the number of units for
individuals, special development or protected development granted building permits during
the preceding month under Subsection B(1), (2) or (3), increased by any unutilized units from
the quotas for the eleven (11) preceding months.
[Amended 10-21-1993 STM, Art. 17]
Protection Against Zoning Change - Any protections against zoning change provided by this
Zoning Bylaw (e.g., § 125-Article II-2-D, Nonconforming Uses or Structures) or by statute (e.g.,
MGL c. 40A, § 6) shall be extended by one (1) month for each month that a building permit
application for the dwelling unit in question has been denied.
[Editor's Note: Former Subsection D, Expiration, amended 10-21-1993 STM, Art. 17, was
repealed 11-29-1999 STM, Art. 1, which also provided for the renumbering of former Subsection

outside of the fencing. The shrubs or trees must be at least four (4) feet tall and no more than
three (3) feet apart when planted, and must mature to a height greater than the fence height.
Existing on-site vegetation must be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. Clearing of
land must be performed in a manner that will maximize preservation of natural beauty and
conservation of natural resources, and that will minimize marring and scarring of the
landscape and silting of streams and wetlands.
No signs are permitted except one (1) sign identifying the facility, owner, and operator, and
including an emergency telephone number where the owner can be reached on a twenty-fourhour
basis; one (1) no trespassing sign; one (1) sign displaying the FCC registration number;

§ 125-V-2. Adult-Oriented Business.
[Added 4-29-2002 ATM, Art. 30]
Purpose and Intent.
It is the purpose of this section to promote public health, safety and general welfare, to
prevent problems of blight and deterioration which accompany and are brought about by the
concentration of adult-oriented businesses, and to regulate the locations of adult uses in order
to lessen the harmful secondary effects on adjacent areas. These secondary effects, which
are documented in various studies of other towns and cities, include an increase in crime, a
decline in property values, a flight of existing businesses and gradual blight of residential
neighborhoods. Accordingly, the purpose of this Adult-Oriented Business Bylaw is to prevent
crime, maintain property values, protect the Town's retail trade and protect and preserve the
quality of residential neighborhoods. In addition, the Town desires to promote a positive
business and community climate along its main commercial thoroughfares thereby retaining
and promoting safe attractive business areas. The Town desires to preserve and protect the
safety of children and young people in the vicinity of schools and public parks where they are
expected to walk.
It is intended that the provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor the effect of
imposing limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative materials, including
sexually oriented materials. It is not the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market; and neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
Special Permit Granting Authority - The Planning Board shall be the special permit granting

Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs, as defined herein.
Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by
the sewage treatment processes employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree
that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
§ 144-14. Action by Board of Selectmen.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers,
which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in § 144-13D of
this chapter and which, in the judgment of the Board of Selectmen, may have a deleterious effect
upon the sewage works, process, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Board of Selectmen may:
Reject the wastes;
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by
existing taxes or sewer charges.
If the Board of Selectmen permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and
installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Board of
Selectmen and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
Industries discharging to the public sewers shall perform such flow monitoring of their discharges
as the Board of Selectmen may require, including installation, use and maintenance of, keeping
records and reporting the results to the Board of Selectmen. The design and installation of these
facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the Board of Selectmen.
§ 144-15. Interceptors to be provided.
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Board of Selectmen,
they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or
any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Board of Selectmen and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
§ 144-16. Preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities.
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.

When required by the Board of Selectmen, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters
and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Board of Selectmen. The manhole shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
§ 144-18. Sampling of wastes.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods as determined by the plant
operator to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, biochemical oxygen demand and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas
pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.)
§ 144-19. Construal of provisions.
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the town and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the town for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern.
§ 144-20. Discharge from septic tanks; permits for septage
haulers; fees.
No septic tank contents shall be discharged into the public sewer system except at the sewage
treatment plant location so designated by the plant operator.
Only septic tank contents from Sunderland shall be allowed. The Board of Selectmen reserves the
right to cancel, suspend or place a limit on any permit issued for the above purpose because of
the discharge of out-of-town septic tank contents into the public sewer or for the purpose of
controlling the solids input to the sewage treatment plant.
Septage haulers shall obtain permits for the discharge of septic tank contents at the office of the
Board of Selectmen. A fee of one dollar ($1.) per year will be charged for each permit issued.
Each permit shall be valid for one (1) year, at which time it must be renewed by the applicant.
§ 144-21. Damage of sewage works.
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is part of the sewage works.

While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in § 144-22 above, the Board of
Selectmen or duly authorized employees and representatives of the town shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the company, and the company shall be held harmless for
injury or death to the town employees, and the town shall hereby indemnify the company against loss
or damage to its property by town employees and against liability claims and demands for personal
injury or property damage assessed against the company and growing out of the gauging and
sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company to
maintain in safe conditions as required in § 144-17.
§ 144-24. Entrance on easements.
The Board of Selectmen and other duly authorized employees of the town bearing proper credentials
and identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the town holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purpose of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement. All
entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement shall be done in full accordance with the terms of
the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.
§ 144-25. Violations and penalties.
Any person found to be violating any provisions of this chapter, except § 144-21, shall be served
by the town with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time
limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in
such notice, permanently cease all violations.
Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit provided for in Subsection A
above shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction thereof, shall be fined in the amount not
exceeding twenty dollars ($20.) for such violation. Each day in which any such violation shall

The applicant shall complete an application for a disposal system construction permit on a form
provided by the Board of Health Office, and shall submit four copies of the plans to the Board of
Health Office, along with an application fee as set by the Board of Health from time to time.
[Added 6-7-1999]
The Board of Health agent/engineer then reviews the plans. If the plans comply with the
necessary regulations and are in accordance with good engineering practices, a permit is issued.
One (1) copy of the approved permit and three (3) copies of the plan, stamped "APPROVED" will
be returned to the applicant. The applicant then may apply for a building permit from the Inspector
of Buildings where applicable.
[Added 6-7-1999]
If the plan is not complete or does not comply with state or Board of Health regulations in all
respects, it will be returned to the applicant, who must have his designer correct the plan as
required. An additional fee, as set by the Board of Health from time to time, shall be required for
each time the plan is returned for revisions, except for the first one. It is strongly recommended
that this be accomplished when the foundation forms are in place in order to minimize the expense
and inconvenience of the correcting an improper installation. It is the responsibility of the
applicant, the designer, and the installer to examine the plan to assure themselves that the house
is in the right place and the system can be constructed as shown on the approved plan. In such
case the structure is not as shown on the approved design plan, a new revised plan shall be
required. An application fee, as set by the Board of Health from time to time, shall be required.
[Added 6-7-1999]
§ 172-5. Duplex housing structures.
Any duplex housing structure shall have a minimum one-thousand-five-hundred-gallon-capacity septic
tank and a minimum one-thousand-five-hundred-square-foot leaching area. With approval, leaching
tanks may be used.
§ 172-6. Condominiums.
These regulations apply to development, construction or conversion intended to establish a
condominium association.
Any septic system expected to receive fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons per day must be
reviewed and approved by the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE).
Prior to the issuance of any disposal works construction permit, a copy of the proposed master
deed must be submitted to the Board of Health for approval. Copies of the master deed shall be
submitted to the Building Inspector and Board of Health along with a written request for review.
The Board shall have twenty-one (21) days to accept or reject the proposed master deed and shall
notify the applicant in writing. Failure of the Board to act upon the request for review shall be
deemed approval for the purposes of issuing disposal works construction permits.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any portion of a condominium until the master
deed, as approved by the Board of Health and/or DEQE, has been duly recorded at the Registry
of Deeds for Franklin County and a final copy has been filed with the Board.
The master deed for an condominium utilizing a subsurface disposal system to be owned jointly
shall include the provision that such system shall be cleaned and emptied at least once every
three (3) years.
Any restriction or constraint placed upon the use or operation of a septic system for a
condominium, either by the system designer or by the Board of Health, shall be written into the
6/18/2019 Town of Sunderland, MA

disposal system is not intended to accommodate garbage grinders.
§ 172-7. Construction requirements.
[Amended 6-7-1999; 12-14-2015]
Prior to installation of any system, the application for disposal works construction and the disposal
works construction permit must be complete with all fees paid.
Construction shall be done only by an installer with a current permit from the Board of Health and
must be in compliance with Title 5 of the State Environmental Code and this regulation. Any
construction being done by an installer without a valid permit will be stopped until such permit is
obtained.
Effective leaching area.
All soil absorption systems in Sunderland shall be sized using the long-term acceptance rates
as specified in 310 CMR 15.242, LTAR - Effluent Loading Rates, except when the system is
preceded by a secondary treatment unit with General Use Certification that allows for a fiftypercent-
reduction in effective leaching area, in which case DEP certified loading rates may
apply, but no additional reduction in leaching area is allowed based on the certification
"effective leaching areas" of the soil absorption system in itself.
The use of "effective leaching areas" or equivalent language as listed in any
innovative/alternative system that results in a smaller total leaching area than would be
calculated using 310 CMR 15.242 is prohibited, except when the soil absorption system is
preceded by a secondary treatment unit with General Use Certification that allows for a fiftypercent-
reduction in effective leaching area.
Innovative/alternative systems that are approved by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection may be used, provided that the total leaching area is calculated
based on the physical dimensions of the product and that the area meets the required area as
calculated in 310 CMR 15.242.
Property line setbacks. All septic tanks, soil absorption systems (primary and reserve), pump
chambers, distribution boxes and piping shall be located at least 25 feet from an abutting lot line or
public roadway layout line.
§ 172-8. Inspections.
[Amended 12-14-2015]
All Title 5 system inspections under 310 CMR 15.301 shall be witnessed by a member of the
Sunderland Board of Health or its agent. If inspection shows distribution box outlets not to be level,
corrective action shall be taken immediately by installation of "speed levelers" or other measures as
approved by the Board of Health witness.

Any disposal works construction permit approved or issued by the Board of Health prior to the effective
date of this regulation shall not be affected by this regulation for a period of three (3) years from the
date of issuance. After three (3) years it shall become fully subject to this regulation.
§ 172-10.1. Variances.
[Added 8-10-1995; amended 12-14-2015]
The Board of Health may vary the application of any provisions of this chapter with respect to any
particular case when, in its opinion:
The enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice; and
In the case of repairs, the applicant requesting the variance has established that the proposed
design provides maximum feasible compliance with the Board's regulations. The provisions of
310 CMR 15.404 and 405 will be used as guidance in the Board's decision.
In the case of new construction, the applicant requesting the variance has established that a
level of environmental protection that is at least equivalent to that provided under the
provision of the local regulation can be achieved without strict application of the provision of
the local regulation from which a variance is sought. With regard to variances for new
construction, enforcement of the provision from which a variance is sought must be shown to
deprive the applicant of substantially all beneficial use of the subject property in order to be
manifestly unjust.
All requests for variances shall be in writing and state the specific local regulation from which a
variance is sought, the reason for the variance, a statement of how the criteria in § 172-10 above
are met, and engineering plans for the proposed disposal system. Four (4) complete sets of the
request, exhibits, and plan shall be submitted. Requested variances from this code and from Title
5 shall be listed on the engineering plans for the system. No request shall be considered complete
until the applicant has submitted and the Board has accepted a disposal system construction
permit application, with appropriate fees.
Public hearing. No later than the next regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the
complete request for variance, the Board of Health will determine a location, date, and time for a
public hearing on the matter and will then notify the applicant. The Board will hold a public hearing
to consider the request within 30 days after the meeting at which the request was accepted and
the hearing scheduled. After hearing testimony at the public hearing, the Board may continue the
hearing to a specified date and time in order to obtain additional information to inform its decision.
§ 172-10.2. (Reserved)

Authority. These regulations are enacted by the Board of Health under the authority which
includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: MGL c. 111, §§ 31, 122, 187 and 188;
310 CMR 11.02 and 310 CMR 15.000 (Title 5).
These Regulations of the Sunderland Board of Health are enacted for the purpose of protection of
the citizens of the Town of Sunderland and also the protection of the environment. As a minimum
code, Title 5 is incomplete and ambiguous in certain specifications and silent on other topics.
Accordingly, local Board of Health regulations are necessary to assure more complete protection
from sewage overflow to the ground surface, which is a source of filth and disease, and also to
assure more complete protection from potential pollution of groundwater, wells, surface waters,
wetland complexes, and certain geologic and water-bearing deposits. Local regulations are also
necessary for purposes of efficient administration and management, as well as for additional
guidance in the process of construction and repair of septic systems. These regulations do not
conflict with Title 5, but rather complement them, and provide additional guidance and protection.

of town waterlines.
§ 177-2. Authority.
Massachusetts General Law c. 111, § 31, Board of Health, may make reasonable health regulations,
and MGL c. 40, § 54, requires that no building permit be issued to a property without a potable water
supply. Water supply officials are responsible for regulating and monitoring public water. The regulation
of private wells is the responsibility of local Boards of Health.

The owner or owner's agent shall furnish the Board of Health with the results of
bacteriological, physical and sanitary chemical analyses of the well water. Such analyses
shall include standard tests for total and fecal coliform organisms, color, turbidity, sediment,
odor, pH, hardness, sodium, iron, manganese, chloride, ammonia, nitrogen, nitrate and nitrite.
The results of such tests shall also be provided to the owner of the property to be served by
the well, and all tests shall be performed by a Division of Environmental Quality Engineering
approved laboratory. The Board of Health may require additional water quality tests where
reasonable contamination threats are known to exist. These additional tests may be for wells
located in former farming areas or in other areas without access to the town water supply
where possible contamination from various chemicals and/or pesticides may be suspected.
Additional tests by owners of older wells may also be required if located in close proximity to
any spillage of toxic materials. As all laboratories are not equipped to test for certain
environmental variables, the laboratory chosen for analyses must be approved by both the
Department of Environmental Quality Engineering and the Board of Health.
[Amended 3-24-1987]

As used in these regulations, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
BOARD or PLANNING BOARD
The Planning Board of the Town of Sunderland.
COLLECTOR STREET
A street which carries traffic equivalent to that generated by fifty (50) dwelling units or more, or
which serves commercial or industrial abutting land.
LANE
A street that carries traffic equivalent to that generated by ten (10) or fewer dwelling units, has no
abutting commercial or industrial property and is not capable of extension.
MINOR STREET
A street that carries traffic equivalent to that generated by fewer than fifty (50) dwelling units, has
no abutting commercial or industrial property and is not a lane.
SUBDIVISION
The division of a tract of land into two (2) or more lots, or, when appropriate to the context, the
process of the "subdivision" of the land or territory subdivided. However, the division of a tract of
land shall not be deemed to constitute a "subdivision" within the meaning of the Subdivision
Control Law if, at the time when it is made, every lot within the tract so divided has frontage on a
public way or a way that the Clerk of the Town of Sunderland certifies is maintained and used as a
public way or a way shown on a plan theretofore approved in accordance with the Subdivision
Control Law, or a way in existence on February 10, 1959, and every lot within the tract has, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction to
provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land abutting
thereon or served thereby and the installation of municipal services to serve such land and the
buildings erected or to be erected thereon. Such frontage shall be of at least such distance as is
then required by the Sunderland Zoning Bylaw for erection of a building on such lot. Conveyances
or other instruments adding to, taking away from or changing the size and shape of lots in such a
manner as not to leave any lot so affected without the frontage above set forth, or the division of a
tract of land on which two (2) or more buildings were standing on February 10, 1959, into separate
lots, on each of which one (1) of such buildings remains standing, shall not constitute a
"subdivision."

§ 194-5. Approval not required (ANR) under Subdivision Control
Law.
Any person who believes his or her plan does not require subdivision approval, because it does
not show a "subdivision" as defined in MGL c. 41 § 81L, and in Article I of these regulations, may
submit to the Planning Board:
The plan; and
Six (6) paper copies of the plan; and
An application form (Form A[1]); and
Editor's Note: Form A is on file in the Town offices.
The applicable filing fee as shown in the fee schedule in Appendix B[2] and on file with the
Town Clerk; and
Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
Any documentation necessary to demonstrate that the plan does not require approval under
the Subdivision Control Law.
A plan submitted under § 194-5 shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements
of the Franklin County Registry of Deeds and shall, at a minimum, show the following information:
The name(s) of the record owner(s) of the subject land, and the names of the owners of all
adjacent land as determined from the most recent tax records of the Town;
The location of all existing buildings on the subject land;
The location of all easements and rights-of-way located on or serving the subject land;
The existing and proposed boundaries of the subject land and of each parcel and lot created
or altered by the plan;
The zoning classification of the subject land;
A locus plan at a scale of one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet showing the subject
land in relation to the nearest intersecting street(s);
The locations, widths, and names of all abutting ways;
A notation reading: "Endorsement of this plan does not certify compliance with zoning or any
Town bylaw or regulation."
Electronic copies of said plan which meet the Level I submission standards of the current
version of the "MassGIS Standard for Digital Plan Submission to Municipalities." Electronic
copies must be submitted on a CD-ROM or other electronic media acceptable to the Planning
Board and must be accompanied by the completed checklist required in the MassGIS
standard.
Frontage on ways in existence.
In determining whether a way that was in existence on February 8, 1958, when the
Subdivision Control Law came into effect in Sunderland, provides adequate frontage to qualify
a plan as not a subdivision, the Board will consider the following:
6/18/2019 Town of Sunderland, MA
https://ecode360.com/print/SU0958?guid=SU0958-DIV-02,12480619,12480620,12480626,12480661,12480666,32542361,12480829,SU0958-DI… 145/179

Is the right-of-way at least thirty-three (33) feet wide and of reasonable horizontal
alignment?
Does the existing horizontal and vertical alignment of the roadway provide safe visibility?
Is the roadway constructed at least sixteen (16) feet wide, with at least eighteen (18)
inches of gravel, and with adequate provisions for drainage?
If the road could ever service more than ten (10) dwelling units, is it bituminous surfaced
or have provisions been made for such surfacing without cost to the Town?
Have provisions been made for public utilities without cost to the Town?
Is the grade less than or equal to ten percent (10%)?
The Board will not find a way in existence when the Subdivision Control Law became effective
in Sunderland to provide adequate frontage unless it meets the above standards. However,
the Board may waive strict compliance with a standard upon its determination, following
consultation with the Selectmen, Highway Superintendent, Police Chief and Fire Chief, that
the way will, in fact, be adequate to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the
proposed use of the land abutting thereon or served thereby, and for installation of municipal
services to serve such land and the buildings erected or to be erected thereon.
Frontage on approved subdivision ways. A way shown on an approved subdivision plan will be
considered as frontage for purposes of MGL c. 41, § 81L only if either:
The way and any associated municipal services are fully constructed in accordance with the
Planning Board's approval of such subdivision plan; or
Such construction has been adequately secured in accordance with MGL c. 41, § 81U.
Frontage on a public way. When the lots shown on a plan presented for endorsement under
§ 194-5 are claimed to have frontage on a public way, the way must physically exist on the
ground. Additionally, the Planning Board may require documentation evidencing the layout and
acceptance of the way as a public way.
Adequacy of access. In addition to determining that all lots shown on a plan presented for
endorsement under § 194-5 have the required frontage on one of the three types of ways
specified in MGL c. 41, § 81L, before endorsing an ANR plan, the Planning Board must also
determine that each lot shown on the plan has practical access from the way upon which the lot
fronts, in that there are no legal or physical impediments that prevent present adequate access to
the lot.
Time limit. Pursuant to MGL c. 41, § 81P, if the Board fails to act upon a plan submitted under
§ 194-5, or fails to notify the Town Clerk and the applicant of its action within twenty-one (21) days
after the plan submission, the Board shall be deemed to have determined that approval under the
Subdivision Control Law is not required and shall forthwith make such endorsement on the plan. If
the Board fails to make such endorsement, the Town Clerk shall issue a certificate to the same
effect.
§ 194-6. Presubmission review for preliminary and definitive
subdivision plans.
Prior to investing in extensive professional design efforts for subdivision plans, it will often prove useful
to review the proposed development of a parcel of land with the Planning Board in order that general
approaches, possible use of cluster development and potential problems can be freely explored. Pencil

sketches, which need not be professionally prepared, will assist the discussion and might show some,
but not all, of the information shown on a preliminary plan. For one- and two-lot subdivisions, this
presubmission review may eliminate the need for such a preliminary plan.
§ 194-7. Preliminary plan.
General. In the case of a proposed nonresidential subdivision, a preliminary plan of the proposed
subdivision shall be submitted to the Planning Board and to the Board of Health. In the case of a
proposed subdivision with lots in a residential zoning district, a preliminary plan of the proposed
subdivision may be submitted to the Planning Board and to the Board of Health. The submission
of such a preliminary plan will enable the subdivider, the Planning Board, the Board of Health,
other municipal agencies and owners of property abutting the subdivision to discuss and clarify the
problems of such subdivision before costly engineering drawings for a definitive plan are prepared.
Therefore, even if not required by these regulations or MGL c. 41, § 81S, it is strongly
recommended that a preliminary plan be filed, except for one- and two-lot subdivisions when a
presubmission review has adequately clarified all issues.
Application procedure. Anyone submitting a preliminary subdivision plan to the Planning Board for
review shall file with the plan a completed application Form B,[1] along with eight (8) copies of the
preliminary plan and a filing fee as specified in Appendix B,[2] and shall also file the preliminary
plan with the Board of Health. The Board shall distribute copies to the Highway Superintendent,
Fire Department, Conservation Commission and Board of Selectmen for their comments and
suggestions.
Editor's Note: Form B is on file in the Town offices.
Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
Contents.
The preliminary plan shall be drawn on Mylar or paper at a scale of one hundred (100) feet to
at least one (1) inch or greater on twenty-four-inch-by-thirty-six-inch sheets and shall be
identified as a preliminary plan. As a minimum, a preliminary plan shall include the following
information:
The subdivision name, boundaries, North point, date, scale, legend, and the title
"preliminary plan";
The name(s) of the record owner(s), the applicant(s), and the designer, engineer or
surveyor;
The names of all abutters as determined from the most recent local tax list;
The existing and proposed lines of streets, ways, easements, and any public areas within
the subdivision in a final or near final alignment;
The proposed system of drainage, sewage disposal and water supply, as well as showing
adjacent existing natural waterways, in a general manner, and indicating whether
streams shown are perennial or intermittent and whether the Conservation Commission
has approved the determination;

§ 194-8D.
A written request for any proposed waivers of subdivision requirements, providing all
reasons and rationales for such waivers.
Approval or disapproval of preliminary plan. Within forty-five (45) days after submission of a
preliminary plan, the Planning Board shall approve such plan, with or without modifications
suggested by it or agreed upon by the person submitting the plan, or the Board shall disapprove
such preliminary plan and, in the case of disapproval, shall state its reasons therefor. The

does not constitute approval of a subdivision, and a preliminary plan may not be recorded in the
Registry of Deeds. Provided that a definitive plan is duly submitted within seven (7) months from
the date of submission of the preliminary plan, the subdivision rules and regulations in effect at the
time of submission of the preliminary plan shall govern the definitive plan, and if the definitive plan
is ultimately approved, the zoning provisions in effect at the time of submission of the preliminary
plan shall govern the land shown on the plan for eight (8) years from the date of endorsement of
approval of the subdivision plan (MGL c. 40A, § 6).
§ 194-8. Definitive plan.

Public hearing. Before approval, modification and approval, or disapproval of the definitive
plan is given, a public hearing shall be held by the Planning Board, notice of the time and
place of which and of the subject matter, sufficient for identification, shall be given by the
Planning Board by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town of
Sunderland, once in each of two (2) successive weeks, the first publication being not less
than fourteen (14) days before the day of such hearing, and by mailing a copy of such
advertisement to the applicant and to all owners of land abutting the land included in such
plan as appearing on the most recent local tax list.
Performance guarantee.
Before the Planning Board endorses its approval of a definitive plan, the developer shall
agree to complete, without cost to the Town, all improvements, including, but not limited
to, construction of improvements and installation of municipal services, required by this
regulation and shall provide security that the applicant will do so, by one of the following
methods or some combination thereof as required by MGL c. 41, § 81U. The methods
are i) by a proper surety bond sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board to secure
performance of the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services
required for the lots, and the Planning Board may require that the applicant specify the
time frame within which such construction shall be completed; ii) by a deposit of money
(cash escrow) or negotiable securities (U.S. Treasury notes or irrevocable letter of credit)
sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board to secure performance of the construction
of ways and the installation of municipal services required for the lots, and the Planning
Board may require that the applicant specify the time frame within which such
construction shall be completed; iii) by a covenant executed and duly recorded by the
owner of record and running with the land whereby such ways and services shall be
provided to serve any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed other than by
mortgage deed; or iv) by an agreement between the applicant and the lender executed
after the recording of the first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan or a
portion thereof given as security for advances to be made to the applicant by the lender,
which agreement shall provide for the retention by the lender of funds (three-party lender
agreement) sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board to secure the construction of
ways and installation of municipal services. The Board may grant partial release from
such security for partial completion of improvements, provided that the completed portion
provides a reasonable system for circulation and utilities pending completion of the rest.
Full security shall not be released until the integrity of road pavement and drainage has
been verified following a full winter of use, until trees and other vegetation have been
established and are documented to be healthy one year after planting, until either the
way has been duly laid out and accepted as a public way or other provisions for its
continued maintenance have been accepted by the Board and until the record ("as built")
plans have been received. For performance guarantees, the principal shall be in an
amount determined by the Planning Board in consultation with its advisers to be sufficient
to cover the cost of all or any part of the improvements specified in these regulations at
state "prevailing wage rates" not covered by a covenant (below), and to cover the costs
of inspections, record plans, road layout plans, and legal work, and a twenty-five-percent
contingency/inflation factor.
Warranty principal (the amount of funds that must be guaranteed to provide a warranty
on the project after project construction is complete) shall be not less than twenty percent
(20%) of the estimated cost of those components of the entire project which shall be
dedicated for public use and shall cover workmanship and materials.
If financial performance guarantees are used, at least two lots that are buildable in the
subdivision must be covered by a covenant (below) to insure that all work, including legal
work, is completed.
Letters of credit, three-party agreement for lender retention of funds, surety bonds and
other financial performance guarantees must be drafted so that the only requirement that

must be met for the Planning Board to draw on the letter is to notify the financial
institution (grantor) that "We have incurred liability by reason of the failure of the
applicant/developer/owner, within ninety days of the expiration of this letter, to complete
the construction of their project (insert name of subdivision and plans) in accordance with
the definitive subdivision plans and submittal, the subdivision approval, the Zoning, and
the Subdivision Rules and Regulations. The amount drawn, which may be more than
required to complete the project, will be held in a segregated bank account until the work
can be bid competitively and the bid awarded and paid for or until the contract for the
work is otherwise let and the work paid. Any excess over the cost of completing the work
will be returned to the grantor."
Such bond, deposit of money or negotiable securities shall be approved as to form, the
surety or financial institution, and manner of execution by the Planning Board. The
Planning Board has the right to deny any such financial performance guarantee based on
the rating of the third-party guarantee, the compliance of the third-party guarantee or the
financial instrument with all of the terms included in these regulations.
For any surety bond:
the surety must agree that any litigation stemming out of the bond will take place in
Massachusetts;
The bond must include the name and address of the person to be served for any
legal action;
The bond must specifically include the terms above; and
No expiration date may be allowed in the bond (the bond must be valid until the work
is complete) and the warranty performance period has been completed.
The covenant or financial performance guarantee shall be contingent upon both the
completion of such improvements and the required one-year warranty after said
completion, as required in these rules and regulations, within a maximum period of three
(3) years of the date of such bond, deposit of money, or covenant. After the completion
date of all improvements and the one-year warranty period, there shall be at least a
three-month warranty settlement period before the expiration date of any bond, deposit of
money, or letter of credit. Said three-month period shall give the Planning Board the
opportunity to collect the financial performance guarantee so that it will be able to
complete the necessary improvements in case a) the applicant/developer is unable to do
so and/or b) the Planning Board denies any requests for an extension of time. "Warranty"
shall include all workmanship and materials.
Upon written request from the applicant/developer, the Planning Board may, at its
discretion, grant an extension of time, and such agreement shall be executed and
affixed to the financial performance guarantee or covenant.
In the case of a surety company bond, such an agreement for an extension shall not
be effective until the surety delivers to the Planning Board a written statement that
the surety agrees to the proposed alteration of the completion schedule and that
such alteration shall not relieve or affect the liability of the surety company.
Failure to complete all improvements as required by these rules and regulations
within the time allotted shall cause the Planning Board:
To draw upon the performance guarantee (surety bond, deposit of money, letter
of credit) in order to complete said improvements; and/or
Schedule a public hearing in order to rescind approval of the subdivision in
accordance with appropriate sections of MGL c. 41, § 81.

The applicant may request a release of lots from covenant in exchange for a financial
guarantee, provided that the lots run consecutively and are released on both sides of the
road simultaneously, beginning with the lots nearest any intersection of the subdivision
road and an existing municipal road and the amount of the financial guarantee and the
financial guarantee process shall be determined by the Planning Board, as described
above.
The applicant/developer must provide an irrevocable right of entry to allow the Town's
agents, board members, and representatives to enter the property to make any
necessary improvements required in the subdivision approval and regulations and
address any safety issues on the site if the Town finds that it must call the financial
performance guarantees. Accepting, calling, or using financial performance guarantees
does not provide the Town with any responsibility to complete a project beyond that for
which the Town is willing to undertake and for which there are sufficient performance
guarantee funds. The property owner shall subordinate all property mortgages to the
irrevocable right of entry and record it in the chain of title at the Registry of Deeds or
Land Court, as applicable.

disapproves such plan, it shall state in its vote the reasons for its action.
Criteria for action by the Board shall be the following:
Completeness and technical adequacy of all submissions.
A determination that development at this location does not entail unwarranted
hazard to the safety, health and convenience of future residents of the development
or to others because of possible natural disasters, traffic hazard or environmental
degradation.
Conformity with the design standards of Article III.
A determination, based upon the environmental analysis when submitted, that the
subdivision as designed will not cause substantial and irreversible damage to the
environment, which damage could be avoided or ameliorated through an alternative
development plan.
A determination that the subdivision plan is in conformance with the Board of Health
recommendations, if any.
Conformity with all applicable zoning requirements.
Approval, if granted, shall be endorsed on the original drawing of the definitive plan by
the signatures of a majority of the Board, after the following has been submitted to and
approved by the Planning Board:

taken, not until the entry of a final decree of the Court sustaining the approval of
such plan.
Any necessary performance guarantee has been posted in accordance with § 194-
8F.
Necessary inspection and other fees have been paid.
The applicant/developer has presented to the Planning Board, for its approval, two
sets of plans showing the complete natural gas (if natural gas is available), electrical,
telephone, cable TV or Internet cabling, and, if applicable, road lighting (including
pipes, pumps, valves, gates, hand-holes, transformer pad mounts and similar
equipment). Said plans will be accompanied by endorsements from the respective
utilities that the plans have received their approval.
The applicant/developer has delivered an irrevocable offer of dedication (specifying
whether such dedication is in fee simple or by easement) of all facilities to be
dedicated to the public, in a form acceptable to the Town, and recorded said offer in
the chain of title at the Registry of Deeds or Land Court, as appropriate. Said offer
must be in a form acceptable to the Planning Board and be accompanied by a
lawyer's title opinion that the offer is free of any liens and encumbrances and that all
mortgages are subordinated to the offer. The offer shall be irrevocable, except the
offer can be withdrawn if the applicant/developer does not proceed with the project
and requests that the subdivision approval be rescinded or otherwise amended such
that the dedication is no longer necessary or if the Town votes against accepting the
offered facilities.
The applicant/developer has submitted a detailed cost estimate for all construction
within the proposed roadway layout and any utility easements (but not within house
lots), certified by the project's registered professional engineer. Said estimate shall
be based on the current edition of the Massachusetts Highway Department's
"Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges" and shall include:
Quantity, unit price and total amount for each construction item;
Total amount for cost of completion of project;
Costs adjusted to account for municipal prevailing wages rates and all municipal
procurement requirements under state law and Town bylaws and practices for
construction projects (i.e., the costs the Town would incur if it was to undertake
the project, not the cost a private sector property owner would incur);
Costs adjusted to add a twenty-five-percent (25%) inflation/safety factor;
Engineering inspection, materials testing, legal and other soft costs.
After endorsement by the Planning Board, the applicant/developer shall deliver to the
Planning Board six sets of copies of the endorsed definitive plan. After approval and
endorsement, the location and width of roads shown thereon, or any road subject to the
Subdivision Control Law, shall not be changed unless the plan is amended and approved
by the Planning Board, paying the appropriate fee and providing the same number of
copies as the original application.

Rescission. Failure of the developer to record the definitive plan at the Registry of Deeds within six
(6) months of its endorsement or to comply with the construction schedule of the performance
agreement (Form E, Covenant, or Form F, Performance Bond),[6] shall constitute sufficient reason
for the rescission of such approval, in accordance with the requirements of MGL c. 41, § 81W.
Editor's Note: Forms E and F are on file in the Town offices.
Approval of the definitive plan or release of security does not constitute the laying out or
acceptance by the Town of streets within a subdivision. Only Town Meeting can accept streets,
and every project shall be designed with institutional controls to ensure proper maintenance for
any street not accepted as a Town street.
Article III. Design Standards
§ 194-9. General provisions.
Districts. For the purposes of the design standards (Article III), the required improvements (Article
IV) and the typical street cross sections, the Town of Sunderland is hereby divided into two (2)
districts designated "The Mountain" and "The Plain." These are shown on the Subdivision Districts
Map. That map and all explanatory matter thereon is hereby made a part of this regulation.[1] It is
recommended that subdivision plans follow the design guidelines contained in Appendix A.[2]
Editor's Note: Said map is on file in the Town offices.
Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.
Design guides. The subdivision shall be designed consistent with these standards and with the
guidelines of Appendix A. The subdivision shall conform, insofar as practical, to any elements in a
Town development policy which the Planning Board may adopt, provided that such elements are
given public hearing in the same manner as prescribed for amendments to subdivision regulations
and made available along with copies of the subdivision regulations.
Cross section. Grading, location of pavements, utilities and other improvements shall be designed
and located as indicated on the Typical Street Cross Sections (see Appendix).[3]
Editor's Note: The Typical Street Cross Sections diagram is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 194-10. Streets and paths.
Location and alignment.
All streets and paths in the subdivision shall be designed to provide safe pedestrian and
vehicular travel and shall be certified by the designer to meet the Massachusetts Highway
Design Manual, except where these regulations create a different standard. Due
consideration shall also be given by the subdivider to the consequences of the street layout
upon the livability, amenity and environmental impact of the subdivision.
Provision satisfactory to the Board shall be made for the proper projection of streets and
paths or for access to adjoining property which is not yet subdivided, including extending
street and path rights-of-way and physical streets and paths to the property line. A
nonrevocable, nonexpiring offer of dedication shall be provided to allow that these streets,
paths, and accessways could be used for future access to adjoining property. Reserve strips,
covenants, deed restrictions or other legal or physical methods of prohibiting access to streets
or adjoining property shall not be permitted, except where, in the opinion of the Board, the
adjoining property would not benefit from such access because of environmental limitations
(e.g., wetlands) or legal restrictions (e.g., conservation land where access is not desirable).
Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet are prohibited.

Street intersections on arterial streets (major intertown streets) shall be spaced not less than
four hundred (400) feet apart.
All streets shall include provision for off-road pedestrian travel on adjacent sidewalks and/or
on separate trails or pathways. Said trails or pathways do not necessarily need to follow the
streets if other locations are likely to provide more enjoyable and/or more direct paths to likely
pedestrian destinations. When located within the street right-of-way, sidewalks, paths, and
trails shall be located at or near the outside of the layout but varied in horizontal location so as
to minimize disturbance of natural features of the land and vegetation.

one hundred (100) feet or, if authorized by the Planning Board, an alternative configuration
accommodating the turning of a vehicle with a wheelbase of thirty (30) feet.
§ 194-11. Easements.
Easements for utilities across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided where
necessary and shall normally be twenty (20) feet wide.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, the Board
may require that there be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of a minimum width of
twenty (20) feet, to conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse, drainageway, channel
or stream, and to provide for construction or other necessary purposes.
Drainage easements outside of the area of the subdivision, but occasioned by it, may be required
of the subdivider.
Cut or fill slopes shall be contained within the street right-of-way.
§ 194-12. Stormwater management.
Storm drainage, culverts and related facilities shall be designed to permit the unimpeded flow of all
natural watercourses, to ensure adequate drainage of all low points along streets, to control
erosion and to intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably related to the
extent and grade of the area drained. Catch basins shall be located at all low points and sags,
near the corners of the roadway at intersecting streets and at intervals of not more than three
hundred fifty (350) feet on continuous grades. To the maximum extent feasible, stormwater shall
be recharged rather than piped to surface water. Peak stream flows at the boundaries of the
development shall be not more than five percent (5%) higher following development than prior to
development.
Storm sewers, retention basins and leaching basins shall be based on a one-hundred-yearfrequency
storm, and culverts shall be based on a one-hundred-year-frequency storm. The design
shall employ backflow valves or other devices as necessary to avoid damage from reverse
circulation of floodwaters and on flooding of the Connecticut River to the levels indicated on the
Map of Flood-Prone Areas, prepared in 1959 by United States Geological Survey.
Design shall be based upon either the Rational Method or the Manning Formula. Water velocities
shall be between two (2) and ten (10) feet per second. The coefficient of runoff used shall be not
less than forty-five hundredths (0.45) for subdivided areas. All developable land tributary to
facilities being designed shall be assumed to be subdivided, except within the Mountain District
and land classified Class I or Class II Agricultural capability by the United States Soil Conservation
Service. Leaching basins or a catch-basin-to-manhole system of drainage is required, with no
storm sewers of less than a twelve-inch inside diameter. Where used, leaching basins shall be
cross-connected. The Board may require test borings at leaching basin locations where
percolation is in doubt.
§ 194-13. Water supply.
Provisions shall be made for water supply to each lot and for fire protection and sewage disposal.
When available, the water supply shall be from the Sunderland Water District system, in which
event system design shall be as specified by the district, evidenced by certification from the district
that it approves the design and will permit connection.

Where connection to the public system is not feasible, a subdivision plan shall be approved only
upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Board, upon advice of the Board of Health, that
adequate and suitable groundwater is available and upon evidence satisfactory to the Board, upon
advice of the Fire Chief, that adequate provisions for firefighting have been made.
§ 194-14. Miscellaneous requirements.
Open spaces. Before approval of a plan, the Board may require that an area be reserved for a
possible park or parks and, by appropriate endorsement on the plan, require that no building be
erected upon such reserved area for a period of three (3) years without the Board's approval.
Such reservation shall be made where particular natural features, abutting public land or the
potential neighborhood need for recreation space make later public acquisition appear desirable,
but in no event shall required reserved areas exceed five percent (5%) of the total area of the
subdivision, unless so required by zoning or other regulations.
Protection of natural features. Due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as healthy
large trees (twelve [12] inches or greater diameter breast height), watercourses, scenic points,
historic stone walls, historic spots and similar community assets. These features shall all be
shown on the plans, and the designer must document how the project avoids, minimizes, and
mitigates (in that order) impacts to these resources.
Written approvals. No definitive plan will be approved unless the developer submits written
certification of approval of the design by all utilities which are to provide services within the
subdivision.
Underground wiring. All wiring, cables and other appurtenances of electric power, telephone and
fire alarm systems shall be placed underground within the limits of the street right-of-way, except
where such underground installation would, in the judgment of the Planning Board, cause undue
hardship by reason of topography, subsoil conditions or other site peculiarities or by reason of the
existing development pattern. Electric power cables shall be not less than thirty (30) inches below
the finished grade.
Flood hazard avoidance. Any subdivision located in any part within the Flood Hazard District as
shown on the Flood Insurance Maps issued by the Federal Insurance Administration (on file with
the Planning Board, Building Inspector and Town Clerk) shall comply with the following:
Street profile design, drainage design, and open space preservation shall be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone areas.
All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
Adequate drainage systems shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
Article IV. Required Improvements
§ 194-15. Responsibility of developer.
The following improvements, to be constructed consistent with good building practice, shall be made
by the developer without cost to the Town.

Stumps, brush, roots, boulders, trees and like material shall be removed as necessary to provide
for paving, shoulders and utilities, but wherever feasible, existing vegetation shall be protected.
All materials not suitable for the foundation shall be removed from an area three (3) feet wider
than the paved width and to a depth of at least fifteen (15) inches below finish grade. In that area,
peat, silt, loam or similar yielding materials shall be removed to a firm foundation after the loam is
removed. No loam suitable for reuse shall be removed from the subdivision unless adequate loam
will remain or is otherwise assured to provide all disturbed areas within the subdivision with a loam
depth of at least six (6) inches, and also there is assurance that all streets from which loam is
being removed will be brought to subgrade with approved materials within six (6) months.
No slopes resulting from the grading of streets shall exceed one (1) foot vertical to three (3) feet
horizontal in fill, one (1) foot vertical to two (2) feet horizontal in cut, or one (1) foot to three-fourths
(3/4) foot in ledge. Slope easements or retaining walls shall be employed to contain slopes within
street side lines. Land between the outside of the layout and the street pavement and driveway
entrances shall be so graded as to prevent surface water on the street from draining onto private
land.
Traveled ways shall be provided with a foundation consisting of at least eighteen (18) inches
compacted thickness of good binding gravel satisfactory to the Highway Superintendent, clean,
free of organic matter and containing no stones over three (3) inches in diameter. The material
shall be thoroughly watered and rolled true to line and grade to conform to the typical street cross
section and the street profiles. Any depressions that occur, either during or after rolling, must be
filled with additional gravel and rolled until the surface is true and even.
The wearing surface of roadways and driveways within the right-of-way shall be a two-course
Type I-1 bituminous concrete pavement, applied with a two-inch (after compaction) base course
and a two-inch (after compaction) finish course, after the roadway has been subjected to traffic for
a time specified by the Highway Superintendent.
The traveled way shall be located as shown on the approved cross section.
§ 194-17. Curbs and swales.
Granite curbs or grassed swales shall be installed wherever the longitudinal pavement grade exceeds
six percent (6%) or elsewhere where required by the Board to control drainage.
§ 194-18. Paths and sidewalks.
Sidewalks and footpaths required under § 194-10A(10) shall be constructed five (5) feet in width;
bicycle paths, ten (10) feet in width.
Surfacing of paths and sidewalks shall continue the material of connecting paths or, where such
do not exist, shall be either a two-course, two-and-one-half-inch Type I-1 bituminous concrete
pavement on a six-inch gravel foundation, or other material specifically approved by the Board.
§ 194-19. Utilities.
Water system.
When connection to the district system is possible, a complete water system shall be
installed, including mains, gates, valves and hydrants, consistent with the specifications and
pipe size requirement of the Sunderland Water District and as shown on the street plans.

with all appropriate regulations of the water district.
No lot which is not connected to the Town water system shall be built upon without the
provision of on-lot water facilities specifically approved by the Board of Health in conformity
with the regulations of said Board as promulgated and amended from time to time.
Stormwater management system. A complete stormwater management system shall be designed
in accordance with § 194-12 by a registered professional engineer and installed as shown on the
street plans and profiles.
Cable utilities. All cable utilities shall be installed. Installation of streetlights may be required by the
Planning Board as necessary for the safety of the inhabitants of the neighborhood.
Sewage disposal facilities. A definitive plan may be approved with either the provision of sanitary
sewers or provision of on-site septic systems in accordance with the current Massachusetts Title 5
regulations. No lot shall be built upon with on-lot sewage disposal facilities unless the septic
systems are specifically approved by the Board of Health in conformity with the regulations of said
board and the state as promulgated and amended from time to time. Perc tests shall be conducted
in accordance with current Title 5 regulations and may not be conducted more than five years in
advance of the submittal of the definitive plan.
§ 194-20. Other requirements.
Boundary markers.
Boundary markers shall be installed at all street intersections, at all points of change in
direction or curvature of streets and at other points where, in the opinion of the Board,
permanent bounds are necessary, but in any event not spaced further than five hundred (500)
feet apart. Such monuments shall be of either granite or concrete, not less than thirty (30)
inches long and five (5) inches square, with dressed top and a one-half-inch drill hole in the
center, and shall be set to finish grade, or with a drill hole and pin in ledge.
No permanent boundary markers shall be installed until all construction which would destroy
or disturb their location is completed.
Street signs. Street signs of a design and material acceptable to the Highway Superintendent shall
be installed for each street at each intersection.
Planting.
Every effort shall be made to preserve and protect existing vegetation.
The subdivider may be required to plant trees where necessary, in view of existing vegetation,
to meet the development guidelines of Appendix A.[1] Before the trees are planted, a plan
showing their proposed location and species shall be submitted to the Planning Board for
approval based on the development guidelines and based on avoidance of problems from
pests, disease or root intrusion. A minimum of one (1) tree of two-inch caliper for each forty
(40) feet of street side line will be required. Trees to be retained shall not have grade changed
over their root areas more than six (6) inches.
Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.

Article V. Administration
§ 194-21. Schedule of work.
The work connected with the items mentioned in Article IV shall proceed in the following order,
each item to be accomplished so as not to interfere with previous work:
Prior to any construction, the developer, project engineer, and contractor must meet with the
Planning Board and other appropriate Town parties for a pre-construction conference to
review the subdivision permit and conditions at a time agreeable to the Planning Board or its
representative. The applicant/developer must provide evidence that all required documents
have been recorded and adequate copies of all documents have been provided to the
Planning Board. After the pre-construction conference, the applicant/developer shall notify in
writing the Planning Board and Planning Board agents at least five (5) business days in
advance of the date of commencement of construction and for each subsequent phase of
construction.
The roadway shall be brought to subgrade.
Water, gas lines, cable utilities and drains shall be placed with related equipment. All service
connections shall be installed to the lot lines unless jacking across the street is feasible
without breaking or weakening road pavement.
Base gravel shall be placed.
Surfacing shall be placed with sidewalks and curbs.
Monuments and street signs shall be placed.
The work shall proceed as above, with exceptions only by order of the Planning Board. After
approval of the definitive plan, the location, material and specifications of all roads, improvements,
and infrastructure subject to the Subdivision Control Law shall not be changed unless 1) the
applicant/developer files a written request to amend the plan, with ten (10) copies of the original
plan showing proposed changes drawn on the plan in red; 2) the applicant/developer pays the
amended plan fee (plus the application fee per lot if new lots are being added); and 3) Such
amendments are approved by the Planning Board (see also MGL c. 41, § 81W). If the Planning
Board approves the change, the applicant/developer shall cause such approved changes to be
shown on the record plans. At the Planning Board's discretion, minor "field changes" may be
approved with a simple vote and letter from the Board.
Inspections shall be arranged for as outlined on Form H Inspection Form.[1] In addition to Town
inspections, at key points in the subdivision construction, the Town of Sunderland utilizes a
privatized inspection system.
Editor's Note: Form H is on file in the Town offices.
Inspection shall be made and the project shall be certified in writing to the Planning Board by a
registered professional chosen by the applicant/developer, who shall certify that all work was done
in accordance with the approved subdivision plans, except as noted, and shall provide a detailed
list and plan of changes between the approved plan and what was built. An engineer or engineer's
agent shall be on site during the entire construction process to ensure compliance with the design.
The certification must be clear and not include such limits or qualifiers as "to the extent of my
knowledge."
§ 194-22. Compliance with subdivision regulations and waivers.

Approval of a subdivision plan, regardless of what is shown on the plan, does not relieve an
applicant/developer from complying with the Subdivision Rules and Regulations except as
specifically provided for in any Planning Board issued waiver of those rules and regulations.
The Planning Board may, in special and appropriate cases, waive strict compliance with such
portions of these rules and regulations, as provided for in MGL c. 41, § 81R, where such action is
in the public interest and consistent with the purpose and intent of the Subdivision Control Law.
The Planning Board shall only grant such waivers when, in its sole opinion, the waivers will result
in clear and significant improvements to the quality of a project compared with a project which
meets the minimum of the subdivision regulations. In making this finding, the Board may, at its
discretion, consider the recommendations from a third-party engineering review.
Such limited waivers shall only be granted when appropriate to encourage development which:
Expands pedestrian-scale village center as a traditional neighborhood development, not
surburban-style development; or
Significantly increases the amount of permanently protected open space and public trails
beyond that otherwise required in the zoning; or
Creates a greater amount of MGL c. 40B-defined affordable housing than is required by
zoning within the development.
A request for a waiver of a requirement, rule, or regulation shall be made in writing and submitted,
whenever feasible, with the preliminary plan. If the Planning Board approves the request for a
waiver, it shall endorse conditions of such waiver (if any) on the plan or set them forth in a
separate instrument attached to and referenced to the plan, which shall be deemed a part of the
plan. The Planning Board shall notify the applicant/developer in writing of its approval,
disapproval, or approval with conditions.
§ 194-23. Planning Board consent.
Not more than one (1) building designed or available for dwelling purposes shall be erected or placed
or converted to use as such on any lot in a subdivision or elsewhere within the Town without the
consent of the Planning Board. Consent shall be granted only for structures in compliance with zoning
restrictions and only upon the Board's finding that adequate ways and utilities servicing such site for
such building having been provided in the same manner as otherwise required for lots within a
subdivision.
§ 194-24. Statutory reference.
For matters not covered by these rules and regulations, reference is made to MGL c. 41, §§ 81K to
81GG, inclusive.
§ 194-25. Rules for hiring outside consultants.
As provided by MGL c. 44, § 53G, the Planning Board may impose reasonable fees for the
employment of outside consultants, engaged by the Planning Board for specific expert services
that the Board deems necessary to reach a final decision on an application pursuant to the
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations and any other Town bylaws, regulations, or rules as
they may be amended or enacted from time to time.
Funds received by the Planning Board pursuant to these rules shall be deposited with the Town
Treasurer, who shall establish a special account for this purpose. Expenditures from this special

account may be made at the direction of the Planning Board without further appropriation as
provided in MGL c. 44, § 53G. Expenditures from this account shall be made only in connection
with the review of a specific project or projects for which a consultant fee has been collected from
the applicant/developer.
Specific consultant services may include but are not limited to the engineering of roads, walkways,
private and public utilities, driveways, grades, grading, and sanitary systems; hydrogeologic and
drainage analysis; impact analyses of various kinds; and environmental and land use law. The
consultant shall be chosen by, and report only to, the Planning Board.
The Planning Board shall give written notice to the applicant/developer of the selection of an
outside consultant, which notice shall state the identity of the consultant, the amount of the fee to
be charged to the applicant/developer, and a request for payment of said fee in its entirety. Such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date it is mailed or delivered. No such costs or
expenses shall be incurred by the applicant/developer if the application or request is withdrawn
within five days of the date notice is given.
The fee must be received in its entirety prior to the initiation of consulting services. The Board may
request additional consultant fees if necessary review requires a larger expenditure than originally
anticipated or new information requires additional consultant services. Failure by the
applicant/developer to pay the consultant fee specified by the Board within ten (10) business days
of the request for payment shall be cause for the Board to determine that the application is
incomplete (except in the case of an appeal). The Board shall state such in a letter to the
applicant/developer, copied to Town Counsel. No additional review or action shall be taken on the
application until the applicant/developer has paid the requested fee. For applications to be
considered under the local bylaw regulations only, failure by the applicant/developer to pay the
consultant fee specified by the Board within ten (10) business days of the request for payment
shall be cause for the Board to deny the application.
The applicant/developer may appeal the selection of the outside consultant to the Selectmen, who
may disqualify the outside consultant selected only on the grounds that the consultant has a
conflict of interest or does not possess the minimum required qualifications. The minimum
qualifications shall consist of either an educational degree or three or more years of practice in the
field at issue or a related field. Such an appeal must be in writing and received by the Selectmen
and a copy received by the Board within ten (10) days of the date consultant fees were requested
by the Board. The required time limits for action upon the application shall be extended by the
duration of the administrative appeal.
§ 194-26. Partial release of performance guarantees.
The applicant may, upon partial completion and installation of required improvements in a subdivision,
the security for the performance of which was given by bond, deposit of money, letter of credit or
covenant, make formal application, in writing, to the Planning Board for partial release of the
performance guarantee, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein:
Financial performance guarantee. The amount of such bond, or deposit of money, or letter of
credit or three-party agreement for lender fund retention held may, from time to time, be reduced
by the Planning Board. To request a reduction fee, the applicant shall present to the Planning
Board the appropriate fee and a list of all construction items performed and/or completed, said list
to be based on the subdivision approval and the subdivision regulations in their entirety. The
amount to be reduced by the Planning Board, after consultation with its agents and advisers, shall
be based upon state prevailing wage construction costs at the time the application for reduction is
made. The Planning Board shall withhold adequate funds to complete the project but shall
withhold a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the original approved cost estimate or fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000), whichever is greater. At the completion of the project (based on a

warranty period, the amount withheld shall be released.
Covenant. The applicant/developer may request a release of conditions for lots where the required
improvements have been completed for that section of roadway beginning at any intersection with
an accepted road and abutting lots up through the last lot to be released. Lots may only be
released if they abut the completed portion of the road. No partial release from the covenants will
be approved if the total length of roadway abutting said designated lots, including a temporary
turnaround, exceeds the maximum allowable length for dead-end roads, unless the Planning
Board has already approved within the limits of the development a dead-end road exceeding said
limits.
In the absence of financial performance guarantees, adequate covenants will be held to insure
completion of the project, including record plans, road layout plans, site inspections, and legal
work. In addition, a covenant on two lots which can be built on will be held until all work in the
subdivision, including the signing of all necessary legal documents, has been completed.
§ 194-27. Full release of performance guarantees.
The applicant may, upon the completion and installation of required improvements in a subdivision, the
completion of record plans and road layout plans as specified in these rules and regulations, and the
completion of a one-year labor and materials warranty period (two years for trees), make formal
application, in writing, to the Planning Board for full release of any outstanding performance guarantee.
Before the Planning Board releases its full interest in said performance guarantee, the Planning Board
shall:
Obtain from the applicant/developer's professional engineer a written certificate of statement
certifying that all work required by these rules and regulations has been constructed in
conformance with the approved construction plans.
Obtain from the applicant/developer letters from the electric, telephone, gas, cable TV or Internet,
and fiber optic/broadband companies, as applicable, stating that their respective underground
systems have been installed to their satisfaction.
Obtain from the applicant/developer a paper and electronic set of record construction plans and
road layout plans. Said plans shall include, but not be limited to, all the information requested in
the subdivision closeout section of these regulations.[1]
Editor's Note: See § 194-20F.
Obtain from the applicant/developer, where applicable, a deed or easement, in a form approved by
the Planning Board, transferring to the municipality or to an approved public utility company,
without cost, valid unencumbered title to any sanitary sewers, water mains, and appurtenances
thereto, and other utilities constructed and installed in the subdivision or approved portion thereof.
Such deed or easement shall include perpetual rights and easements to construct, inspect, repair,
renew, replace, operate and forever maintain such sanitary sewers, water mains and other utilities,
with any manholes, conduits, and other appurtenances, and to do all acts incidental thereto, in,
through, and under the whole of all roads in the subdivision or approved portion thereof. If any
such utility has been constructed and installed in land not within such roads, then the deed or
easement shall include a strip of land extending a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in width on each
side of the center line of all such utilities. The Planning Board may require greater than fifteen (15)
feet in width on each side of the center line where it deems necessary.
If the Planning Board determines that all improvements as shown on the endorsed definitive plan
and all required plans and legal documents have been completed satisfactorily, it will release all
the interest of the municipality in such performance guarantee and return the bond to the person

who furnished the same, or release the covenant, by appropriate instrument, duly acknowledged,
which may be recorded.
If the Planning Board determines after inspection that said construction or installation has not
been completed, or that said construction or installation fails to comply with these rules and
regulations, it will send by registered mail to the applicant/developer and to the Town Clerk the
details wherein said construction or installation fails to comply with its rules.
The applicant/developer shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to correct all
problems mentioned above, unless a written extension is requested and approved by the Planning
Board. Failure of the applicant/developer to finish all the necessary work within said time period
shall authorize the Planning Board to draw upon the performance guarantee.
Any such performance guarantee may be enforced and any such deposit may be applied by the
Planning Board for the benefit of the municipality, as provided in MGL c. 41, § 81, upon failure of
the performance for which any bond or deposit was given to the extent of the reasonable cost to
the municipality of completing such construction and installation.
