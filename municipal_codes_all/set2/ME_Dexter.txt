1. To discuss a personnel matter concerning individuals or groups of employees or officials, when such public discus- sion could damage a person's reputation, or violate an individual's right to privacy under Maine Statutes.
2. For real estate and economic development negotiations, but only when premature disclosure of information per- taining to these negotiations would hurt the Town's competitive or bargaining position.
3. For discussion of labor contracts, and proposals between the Town and labor negotiators, but these negotiations may be held openly provided that both parties agree.
4. For meetings between the Town and its attorney to discuss the legal rights of the body, pending or contem- plated litigation, or settlement offers when premature general public knowledge would clearly place the town at a substantial disadvantage.
5. For discussion of information contained in records made confidential by statute, including, but not limited to, consideration of abatement requests made on the basis of poverty or infirmity.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 2-1. Disposal of town property; appraisals.
In general, all town property shall be disposed of by public bid. When it appears that certain types of developments are in the best interest of the town, the council may negotiate directly with potential developers for the sale of needed town-owned land. The council will use the assessed value as a basis of negotiations. The developer may obtain his own appraisal if he so wishes. The town may require appraisals for properties by acting to do so, but will not generally require this in order to save the cost of appraisal.

Sec. 2-2. Property tax abatement.
(a) Application for abatement.
(1) Applicants seeking a poverty abatement have the burden of proving that they are eligible for the abatement; it is not the council’s responsibility to prove that the applicant is not entitled to an abatement.
(2) Persons desiring an abatement must complete an applica- tion for abatement of property taxes. People who meet the current general assistance eligibility standards are eligible for a poverty tax abatement if they are unable to contribute to the public charge and if there are no other mitigating factors such as projected income, excess real or personal property, or unreasonable or unnecessary expenses. The council will also consider the applicant’s ability to contribute to the public charge both at the present time and during the year or years the taxes went unpaid. Any false written or oral statements by the applicant is cause for immediate rejection of the applica- tion for abatement.
(3) If an applicant is not eligible under general assistance guidelines, the town council will consider the application based upon applicant’s income and expenses. Factors to
Supp. No. 37
147
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 2. Administration
§ 2-2 DEXTER CODE
take into consideration include the applicant’s income, both current and projected; unnecessary assets such as an excessively expensive vehicle, plus extra cars, recreational vehicles, boats, real estate, etc.; actual expenses which may not be reasonable and necessary and which may be reduced or eliminated; and other sources of income or methods to alleviate their financial distress such as relatives who are legally obligated to provide such assistance; reasonably available refinanc- ing; and public assistance; or other potential resources to which the applicant is legally entitled.
(4) When an application is filed, the council may ask the applicant to permit them to delay action on the request. The council usually prefers to wait to make its final decision until just prior to when the lien forecloses. This policy is based on the council’s hope that the applicant’s financial condition will have improved by that time so that the abatement is not needed. If the applicant agrees with the proposed delay, he/she should sign and return the postponement notice within fourteen (14) days.
(b) Policy in granting an abatement.
(1) If applicants are clearly poor and have little or no likelihood of any prospects which would enable them to pay
Supp. No. 37
148
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 2. Administration
ADMINISTRATION §2-3
taxes, the council is obligated to grant an abatement. A partial abatement is appropriate in those cases where the applicant can pay part of the taxes or will be able to pay a portion of the taxes prior to the lien expiring.
(2) The council will grant a full abatement, a partial abatement or deny the abatement according to the guidelines set forward in this policy and 36 M.R.S.A. § 841(2). The council will issue its decision to the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of the council's final action or within thirty (30) days of the date of application, whichever is sooner.
(3) Right of appeal upon denial of abatement. Applicants who have had their request for abatement denied have the right to appeal the denial within sixty (60) days to the local board of assessment review.

Sec. 2-3. Tax increment financing guidelines.
(a) Policy guidelines. For a tax increment financing (TIF) application to be considered by the town, the application must be reviewed for compliance with the following guidelines. Notwithstanding compliance with any or allof the guidelines, the creation of a TIF district is a policy choice to be made by the town council on a case-by-case basis. A TIF is not a right under Maine law and meeting these guidelines does not create a right or entitlement in any applicant.
( 1) Basic provisions. The applicant is responsible for providing any and all documentation that is necessary for consideration of any proposed agreement between the applicant and the town. The town's share shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the incremental taxes over the life of the district.

3. The unavailability of sufficient private or other public funding sources to meet the full capital investment needs of the corporate entity.
b. The project creates significant new tax value equal to or greater than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00).
c. Financial capability to widertake the project must be evidenced prior to review.
d. Compliance with all statutory and regulatory guidelines of the town and state.

c. The project improves a blighted area in need or redevelopment, or an area identified as a priority by the town.

(4) Standard operating procedures. The town's department of community development (or town manager if the department of community development is unstaffed at the time of application) will act as a clearinghouse and coordinate all activity regarding tax increment financing proposals. Working with potential applicants, the community development department will:
a. Provide information on tax increment financing and provide preliminary TIF application forms;

(2) The applicant refuses to complete or sign the application or any other form needed by the general assistance administrator.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5·38. Temporary refusal to accept application.
Under special circumstances, the general assistance administrator may temporarily refuse to accept applications for twentyfour (24) hours. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) When the applicant's conduct is abusive, disruptive, or harassing, or when the applicant is under the influence of
Supp. No. 4 335
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-38 DEXTER CODE
drugs or alcohol. In these situations, the applicant will be asked to leave, and if the applicant refuses to leave, the police may be summoned. The applicant will be informed that an application will be accepted when his/her conduct is under control;
(2) When a third person applies for assistance on behalf of the applicant. That person may be required to provide written verification that he/she has been duly authorized to act as a representative for the applicant (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308).
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5·39. Emergencies.
(a) Generally. An emergency is considered to be any life threat· ening situation or a situation beyond the control of the applicant which ifnot alleviated immediately could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the health or safety of the applicant or a member of the household (22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.4). Although they may be considered otherwise ineligible to receive general assis· tance, people who apply for assistance to alleviate an emergency will be granted assistance, except as provided below, if they do not have sufficient income and resources to meet an actual emer· gency need and have not had sufficient income and resources to avert the emergency (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308).
(b) Disqualification. A person who iscurrently disqualified from receiving general assistance due to a violation of sections 5-55, 5-56, 5-57, or 5-64 of this chapter is ineligible to receive emer· gency assistance (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308.2(A)). Dependents of a disqualified person may be eligible for assistance. For the purposes of this section, "dependents" are defined as: (1) A dependent minor child; (2) an elderly, ill or disabled person; or (3) a person whose presence is required to provide care for any child under the age of six (6) years or any ill or disabled member of the household (22
M.R.S.A. § 4309.3). In the event one (1) or more members of a household are disqualified and assistance is requested for the remaining dependents, the eligibility of those dependents will be calculated as though the household is comprised of the dependents only, except that all household income will be considered available to them.
Supp. No. 4 336
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-39
(c) Assistance prior to verification. Whenever an applicant informs the administrator that he/she needs assistance immediately, the administrator will grant, pending verification, the assistance within twenty-four (24) hours, provided that:
(1) After interviewing the applicant the administrator has determined that he/she will probably be eligible for assistance after a verification of information is completed; and
(2) The applicant submits documentation when possible, to verify his/her need.
The administrator may contact at least one (1) other person to confirm the applicant's statements about needing emergency assistance. No further assistance will be authorized until the applicant's eligibility is confirmed (22 M.R.S.A. § 4310).
(d) Telephone applications. If a person has an emergency need and cannot apply in person due to illness, disability, lack of transportation, lack of child care, or other good cause, and if there is no authorized representative who can apply for the applicant, the administrator will accept an application over the telephone.
The administrator will not grant any assistance as the result of a telephone application if the applicant refuses to allow the administrator to verify the information either by visiting his/her home or by mail and the administrator cannot determine his/her eligibility through any other means.
(e) Limitation on emergency assistance. Applicants are not automatically eligible for emergency assistance. If applicants had income which could have been used to prevent all or part of an emergency, but they spent that income on items which are not basic necessities, they will not be eligible to receive general assistance to replace that money. Applicants have the responsibility to provide the administrator with verifiable documentation demonstrating that the applicant did not have sufficient income to avert the emergency situation. According to the following criteria, the administrator may limit emergency assistance to cover only the difference between the amount of money necessary for the household to avoid the emergency and the amount of income available to the household during the applicable time period.
(1) The applicable time period shall be the thirty (30) days preceding the application for emergency assistance, except
Supp. No. 4 337
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5.39 DEXTER CODE
in those cases where the emergency was created by a negative account balance for a commodity or service (such as rent, mortgage or utility payments), and the negative account balance was created over a longer period of time. In such cases, the applicable time period shall be the consecutive length of time the account balance has been in the negative.
(2) The administrator shall seek from the applicant all information pertinent to the applicant's ability to provide for his or her basic necessities for the applicable time period.
(3) The applicant shall provide evidence of income and resources for the applicable time period.
(4) The administrator shall compute all costs for the household's basic necessities during the applicable time period, per month, in accordance with the maximum levels established by this chapter for the specific basic necessities or the actual monthly cost, whichever is less, including all costs associated with averting the particular emergency situation for which the applicant is seeking assistance.
(5) From the total household costs for basic necessities during the applicable time period, the administrator shall subtract the total income and lump sum payments available to the household for the applicable time period as well as the total general assistance actually received during the applicable time period.
(6) The administrator may restrict the issuance of emergency assistance to the difference yielded by the computation in subsection (5), even when such a grant will not totally alleviate the emergency situation.
(7) The administrator may waive this limitation on emergency assistance in life threatening situations or for first time applicants; that is, persons who have not applied for or received general assistance from this municipality within the last twelve (12) months or any other municipality within the last six (6) months.
(8) Notice of the municipal authority to limit emergency assistance according to 22 MRSA § 4308(2)(B) and this article shall be issued to all applicants.
Supp. No. 4 338
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-40
(9) Nothing in these criteria may be construed as prohibiting a municipality from electing to alleviate an emergency situation in the most cost-effective manner available, provided such a determination of eligibility for emergency as· sistance is in conformance with general assistance law.
(Ord. No. C92·5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5·40. Residence.
(a) General provisions. The administrator shall provide general assistance to all eligible persons applying for assistance who are residents of this town. A resident is a person who has no other residence and is physically present in this town and who intends to remain here and establish a household.
The town also recognizes its responsibility to provide assistance to eligible persons who apply here and who are not residents of this town or any other municipality. If a person who is not a resident of any municipality applies in this town first, the admin· istrator will determine his/her eligibility and, if eligible, will grant assistance until he/she establishes a residence in another munic· ipality (22 M.R.S.A. § 4307).
(b) Moving/relocating. The town will not consider moving or transporting an applicant or recipient into another municipality unless the person requests assistance to relocate to another municipality. If the administrator determines the applicant is eligible and grants financial assistance to help the applicant relocate, the town will be responsible for providing assistance to him/her for thirty (30) days after he/she moves provided the recipient remains eligible.
(c) Institutions. If a resident of the town enters an institution located in another municipality (such as a group home, shelter, rehabilitation center, nursing home, or hospital) and requests assistance while at the institution, he/she will be the responsibility of the town for up to six (6) months after he/she enters the institution. The town thereafter retains responsibility for an applicant in an institution only if the applicant has maintained a home in the town to which he/she intends to return. The town also recognizes its responsibility for applicants residing in an institu-
Supp. No. 4 339
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5.40 DEXTER CODE
tion in the town if he/she had no residence prior to entering the institution (22 M.R.S.A. § 4307.4).
(d) Temporary housing. Hotels/motels and similar places of temporary lodging are considered institutions (see above) if the town grants financial assistance for, makes arrangements for, or advises or encourages an applicant to stay in temporary lodging. [Note: municipalities which illegally deny housing assistance and, as a result of the denial, the applicant stays in temporary lodging are responsible for the applicant for up to six (6) months and may be subject to other penalties (22 M.R.S.A. § 4307.4).]
(e) Disputes. When the administrator believes that an appli· cant is a resident of another municipality but that municipality disputes its responsibility the administrator will notify the Department of Human Services in Augusta (289-3691 or 1-800-442· 6003). If the applicant applies in the town first, the administrator will determine his/her eligibility and, if eligible, will grant assistance until the Department has concluded which municipality is responsible for providing assistance. If another municipality was responsible, the Department will recover the amount due from the other municipality (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4307.5, 4307.6).

Secs. 5·41-5-50. Reserved.
ARTICLE V.ELIGIBILITY FACTORS
Sec. 5-51. Initial application.
(a) Generally; "need" defined. For initial applicants, need will be the sole condition of eligibility. An initial applicant is a person who has not applied for general assistance in this municipality within the last twelve (12) months, or to any Maine municipality within the last six (6) months. Iftwelve (12) months pass from the time of one (1) application to the next, the next application will be considered an "initial application" and the person's eligibility will be determined solely on the basis of need (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308).
Supp. No. 4 340
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5.53
"Need" means that the applicant's income and resources are less than the overall maximum level of assistance contained in section 5-68 of this chapter or the actual thirty-day costs, whichever is less, and he/she does not have adequate income or other resources available to provide basic necessities.
(b) Subsequent applicants. Persons who are not initial applicants must be in need, use their income and resources to secure basic necessities (see section 5-66), and meet aii other eligibility conditions contained below.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-52. Eligibility for categorical assistance.
Receipt of categorical assistance will not disqualify a person from receiving general assistance, if he/she is otherwise eligible. Benefits received from other assistance programs will be consid· ered as income when determining need, with the exception of Food Stamps, which will not be counted as income or resources or otherwise taken into consideration when determining need (7
U.S.C. § 2017(b)). Also, any fuel assistance (HEAP/ECIP) received by an applicant will not be considered as income or resources; that is, the administrator will always compute the heating needs of an applicant who has received HEAP or ECIP as if that applicant paid for his/her total fuel costs (42 U.S.C. § 624(f); Dept. of Health and Welfare v. Block, 784 F.2d 895). The computation of general assistance for heating energy needs when an applicant has received HEAP or ECIP shall be accomplished in accordance with subsection (c) under Types of Income at section 5-67 of this chapter.
Applicants or recipients must apply for other program benefits within seven (7) days after being advised in writing to do so by the general assistance administrator. Persons who, withoutjust cause, make no good faith effort to receive a potential resource will be disqualified from receiving assistance until they make a good faith effort to obtain the benefit (22 M.R.S.A. § 4317).
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-53. Personal property.
(a) Liquid assets. No person owning assets easily convertible into cash including, but not limited to, bank deposits, stocks,
Supp. No. 4 341
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-53 DEXTER CODE
bonds, certificates of deposit and other marketable security will be eligible for general assistance unless and until he or she uses these assets to meet his/her basic needs and thereby exhausts them.
(b) Tangible assets. No person owning or possessing personal property consisting of more than one (1) motor vehicle, or a boat, trailer, recreation vehicle or other assets that are convertible into cash and are nonessential to the maintenance of the applicant's household will be eligible for general assistance. Exceptions may be made when a person is making an initial application and when reasonable efforts to convert assets to cash at fair market value are unsuccessful.
Tools of a trade, livestock, farm equipment and other equipment used for the production of income are exempt from the above category and are not considered available assets.
(c) Automobile ownership. Ownership of one (1) automobile per household will not make a person ineligible for assistance if such vehicle is essential for transportation to employment, medical care, rehabilitation or training facilities, or if it is essential to the maintenance of the applicant and his/her family. Recipients of general assistance who own an automobile with a market value greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) may be required, with written, thirty-day notice, to make a good faith effort to trade that automobile in to a reputable automobile dealer for an automobile with a market value of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Any income received by the applicant by virtue of such a trade down must be used for his/her basic necessities. Failure to liquidate or trade down the excess value of an automobile asset can result in disqualification (22 M.R.S.A. § 4317). The town will neither pay nor consider as necessary expenses any car payment for which the applicant is responsible. General assistance for travel-related needs shall be computed in accordance with section 5-68(k)(6), (7).
(d) Insurance. Insurance that is available to an applicant on a noncontributory basis or that is required as a condition of employment will not be a factor in determining eligibility for gen· eral assistance. Life insurance with a cash surrender value may
Supp. No. 4 342
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5.55
be considered as a tangible asset when an applicant has received assistance for four (4) weeks or more after the initial application.
(e) Transfer of property. Applicants who transfer assets for less than fair market value to someone else solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance will be denied. Assistance will be denied within a ninety-day limit up to the uncompensated value of the asset which was transferred unless the transfer of asset is fraudulently misrepresented, in which case a ninety-day disqualification will issue. There will be a presump· tion that the applicant transferred his/her assets in order to be eligible for general assistance if the transfer occurred within thirty
(30) days prior to applying for general assistance unless the applicant can prove otherwise, or if property is sold to a relative or acquaintance for less than the fair market value.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-54. Ownership of real estate.
If the applicant or dependents own real property other than that occupied as the principal home, continued eligibility will depend on the applicant making a reasonable effort to:
(1) Dispose of the property at fair market value in order to convert the property into cash which can be applied toward meeting present need; or
(2) Obtain a loan against such property which may be used to meet present need. Applicants who transfer their excess property to someone solely to appear eligible for general assistance will be ineligible.
If an applicant is granted assistance in the form of a mortgage payment or capital improvement payment, the town may claim a lien against the property. The lien shall not be enforceable until the time of sale of the property or upon the death of the recipient (22 M.R.S.A. § 4320, see also section 5-68).
Sec. 5-55. Work requirement.
All general assistance recipients are required to work, look for work, and fulfill the work requirements, unless they are exempt as provided below.
(1) Employment; rehabilitation. All unemployed applicants and members of their households who are sixteen (16) years of
Supp. No. 4 343
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5.55 DEXTER CODE
age or older will be required to accept any suitable job offer or opportunity for rehabilitative services, except as provided below (see Exemptions). Applicants must demonstrate to the administrator that they are available for work and are actively seeking employment.
a. A "suitable job" means any job which the applicant is mentally and physically able to perform.
b. "Available for work" means that applicants must make themselves available for work during normal business hours prevailing in the area, and show that no circum· stance exists which would prevent them from com· plying with the work requirement.
(2) Verification. Applicants will be required to provide verifi· able documentation of their pursuit of employment at the time of each application. At a minimum, such documentation shall consist of a list of the employers contacted, the date and time of the application contact, and the name of the employer representative contacted. "Pursuit of employment" means actually submitting a written appli· cation or applying for a job in person when reasonable, or submitting a written application or letter of inquiry to employers. Each recipient will be responsible for applying for no less than two (2) jobs per week in municipalities having populations of less than one thousand (1,000); three (3) jobs per week in municipalities of one thousand one (1,001) to ten thousand (10,000) population; or five (5) jobs per week in municipalities having a population in excess of ten thousand (10,000). These requirements will not be imposed at the time of the initial application, but will be a condition of eligibility for subsequent assistance.
(3) Disqualification. After being granted assistance at the time of initial application, applicants will be considered ineligible for further assistance for ninety (90) days if they, without just cause:
a. Refuse to register for employment with the Maine Job Service;
b. Refuse to search diligently for employment when the search is reasonable and appropriate. Recipients who
Supp. No. 4 344
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-55
unreasonably seek work at the same places repeatedly will not be considered to be performing a diligent worksearch and will be disqualified.
c. Refuse to accept a suitable job offer;
d. Refuse to participate in an assigned training, education or rehabilitation program that would assist the applicant in securing employment;
e. Fail to be available for work;
f. Voluntarily quit work or are discharged for misconduct connected with his or her work. Applicants who are employed are expected to remain on the job and not quit or lose their employment except for just cause (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301.8, 4316-A).
g. Refuse to participate or participate in a substandard manner in the municipal work program (see section 5-56).
(4) Just cause. Applicants will be ineligible for assistance for ninety (90) days if they refuse to comply with the work requirements of this section without just cause. Just cause will be considered to exist when there is reasonable and verifiable evidence that:
a. The applicant has a physical or mental illness or dis- ability which prevents him/her from working;
b. The work assignment pays below minimum wages;
c. The applicant was subject to sexual harassment;
d. The applicant is physically or mentally unable to perform required job tasks, or to meet piece work standards;
e. The applicant has no means of transportation to or from work or a training or rehabilitation program;
f. The applicant is unable to arrange for necessary child care or care of ill or disabled family members;
g. Any reason found to be good cause by the Maine Employment Security Commission, or any other verifiable reason which the administrator considers reasonable and appropriate will be accepted asjust cause (22
M.R.S.A. § 4316-A.5).
(5) Eligibility regained. Persons who are disqualified for ninety
(90) days because they violated the work requirement may
Supp. No. 4 345
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-55 DEXTER CODE
regain their eligibility if and only when they become em· ployed or otherwise satisfy the administrator that they are complying with the work requirement by fulfilling the work requirement they violated. Persons who have been disqualified for ninety (90) days for refusing to participant in the municipal workfare program or for performing their workfare assignment in a substandard manner shall be limited to a single opportunity to regain eligibility. If a workfare participant fails to regain eligibility, without just cause, after being offered a distinct and separate opportunity to do so, the administrator shall enforce the ninety-day dis· qualification for the term of its initial duration (22
M.R.S.A § 4316-A(4)).
(6) Dependents. Failure of an otherwise eligible person to comply with the work requirements shall not affect the eligibility of any member of the person's household who is not capable of working, including:
(1) A dependent minor child;
(2) An elderly, ill, or disabled person; and
(3) A person whose presence is required in order ·to provide care for any child under six (6) years of age or for any ill or disabled member of the household 22 M.R.S.A § 4309.3).
In the event one (1) or more members of a household are disqualified and assistance is requested for the remaining depen· dents, the eligibility of those dependents will be calculated as though the household is composed of the dependents only, except that all household income will be considered as available to them.
(7) Exemptions. The above work requirements do not apply to any person who is elderly, physically or mentally ill or disabled. Any person whose presence is required to care for any pre-school age child or for any ill or disabled member of the household is also exempt from these requirements.
The requirements of this section will not be imposed so as to interfere with an applicant's existing employment, ability to pursue a bona fide job offer, ability to attend an interview for possible employment, classroom participation in a primary or sec-
Supp. No. 4 346
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-56
ondary educational program intended to lead to a high school diploma, classroom participation in a training program which is either approved or determined by the Department of Labor to be expected to assist the applicant in securing employment, or classroom participation in a degree-granting program operated under the control of the Department of Human Services or Department of Labor.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-56. Municipal work program.
(a) Generally. Each applicant and any member of the household who is capable of working may be required to perform work for the municipality, including work for a nonprofit organization, as a condition of receiving assistance (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A.2). The work requirement provisions found in section 5-55 regarding just cause, dependents, and exemptions also apply to the munic· ipal work program.
(b) Consent. Persons assigned to the work program are required to sign a form stating that they understand the requirements of general assistance and the work program. Prior to signing the form, the administrator will read it to the applicants or the applicants will read it themselves. The form will also state the number of hours the applicants must work and the hourly rate of compensation.
(c) Limitations. The work requirement is subject to the following limitations (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A.3).
(1) No person shall, as a condition of eligibility, be required to do any amount of work that exceeds the value of the net general assistance that the person would otherwise receive under municipal general assistance standards. Any person performing work under this subsection shall be provided with net general assistance the value of which is computed at a rate of at least the state's minimum wage.
(2) No workfare participant shall be required to work for a nonprofit organization if that work would violate the participant's basic religious beliefs;
(3) In no case shall eligible persons performing work under this subsection replace regular municipal employees.
Supp. No. 4 347
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-56 DEXTER CODE
(4) In no case will work performed under this subsection interfere with an eligible person's:
a. Existing employment;
b. Ability to follow up on a bona fide job offer;
c. Attendance at an interview for possible employment;
d. Classroom participation in a primary or secondary educational program intended to lead to a high school diploma; or
e. Classroom participation in a training program which is approved or determined by the Department of Labor to be reasonably expected to assist the person in securing employment, or classroom participation in a degree-granting program operated under the control of the Department of Human Services or the Department of Labor.
(5) In no case may an eligible person be required to work more than forty (40) hours per week. An eligible person who has full or part-time employment shall be exempt from the work requirement to the extent that the work requirement in combination with his/her regular employment would result in the person working more than forty (40) hours per week.
(6) In no case will an eligible person be required to perform work beyond his/her capabilities. However, when an illness or disability is claimed, an eligible person may be required as a condition of receiving assistance to present a doctor's statement detailing the extent of the disability or illness (22 M.R.S.A. § 4309).
If the administrator requires a doctor's statement to verify an applicant's illness or disability, the municipality will pay for the doctor's evaluation if the applicant has no means to pay for the exam, however in such a case the administrator will choose the doctor. The administrator will not require verification of medical conditions which are apparent or which are of such short duration that a reasonable person would not ordinarily seek medical attention (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316.5).
(7) In no case may an eligible person with an immediate need (i.e., a person in an emergency situation who has not been
Supp. No. 4 348
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-56
disqualified from receiving assistance for committing a program violation) be required to perform work under this subsection prior to receiving general assistance. The administrator shall meet immediate needs upon receiving written assurance from the eligible person that he/she is willing to work for the assistance received. When the recipient has no immediate need, workfare participation may be required prior to receiving general assistance provided that the assistance is given within twenty-four (24) hours of application submission.
(d) Work-related expenses. Expenses related to work performed under this subsection will be added to the amount of net general assistance to be provided to the person (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316.2(E)). The municipality will provide any special clothes or equipment the recipient needs to perform his/her work assignment.
(e} Disqualification. Any person who willfully fails to perform or willfully performs below average standards the work assigned by the municipality, without just cause, will be ineligible for assistance for ninety (90) days, (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A.1). As soon as the administrator knows that a recipient failed to fulfill the work assignment, the administrator will notify the recipient that he/she is disqualified for ninety (90) days unless: (1) The recipient can show just cause; or (2) the recipient completes the work assignment.
(f) Eligibility regained. Recipients who are disqualified from receiving assistance because they have violated the requirements of the municipal work program may regain their eligibility under the following conditions.
Recipients who fail to complete the first municipal work assignment they have been given (since an initial application) will be disqualified from receiving assistance during the next ninety (90) days, although dependents in the household may be eligible (see section 5-55).
If during the ninety-day disqualification period the recipient makes a timely and reasonable request to perform the work assignment which he or she, without just cause, failed to perform, the disqualified recipient will be given an opportunity to regain
Supp. No. 4 349
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-56 DEXTER CODE
eligibility. The administrator will give the recipient a work assignment as soon as possible. If the recipient has an emergency need and cannot make up the work assignment in time to alleviate the emergency, the administrator will provide sufficient assistance to the recipient to avert the emergency, but the provision of such emergency assistance will not bar the administrator from subsequently enforcing the ninety-day disqualification if the recipient fails to regain eligibility by satisfactorily performing the work assignment. The amount of emergency assistance granted will be considered in the computation of the total number of hours the recipient must work.
Recipients who have asked to regain their eligibility during a ninety-day disqualification period and who agreed to fulfill the assignment which they previously failed to perform and who, without just cause, fail to fulfill their municipal work assignment will be considered to have acted in bad faith. In such a circumstance, the administrator will enforce the ninety-day disqualification for the term of its initial duration.
Any recipient who intentionally causes damage to property or harms other employees by his/her actions and is discharged by the work supervisor will not be entitled to regain eligibility by returning to the work program. Eligibility may be regained by otherwise becoming employed and meeting the definition of need.
For the purposes of regaining eligibility under sections 5-55 and 5-56 of this chapter by becoming employed, "employment" shall mean the provision of a service to an employer with respect to which a tax is required to be paid under any federal law imposing a tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund or which as a condition for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act is required to be covered under Maine law.
(g) Reports. The administrator will itemize the assistance that has been provided to persons who work for the municipality in reports to the Department of Human Services (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A.2).

Sec. 5-57. Use of resources.
(a) Generally. Each applicant has the responsibility to make a good faith effort to utilize every available or potential resource which may reduce his/her need for general assistance (see definition of "resources"). People who refuse or fail to make a good faith effort to secure a potential resource after receiving written notice to do so are disqualified from receiving assistance until they make an effort to secure the resource. Applicants are required to prove that they have made a good faith effort to secure the resource (22
M.R.S.A. § 4317).
(b) Minors. A minor under the age of eighteen (18) who has never married and is applying independently for general assistance and who is pregnant or has a dependent child or children will be eligible to receive general assistance only if the minor is residing in the home of his or her parent, legal guardian or other adult relative, in which case the entire household will be evaluated for eligibility. Exceptions to this limitation on eligibility will be made when:
(1) The minor is residing in a foster home, maternity home, or other adult-supervised supportive living arrangement; or
(2) The minor has no living parent or the whereabouts of both the parents are unknown; or
(3) No parent will permit the minor to live in the parent's home; or
(4) The minor has lived apart from both parents for at least one (1) year before the birth of any dependent child; or
(5) The Department of Human Services determines that the physical or emotional health or safety of the minor or the minor's dependent child or children would be jeopardized if the minor and his or her child or children lived with a parent; or
(6) The Department of Human Services determines, in accordance with its regulation, that there is good cause to waive this limitation on eligibility (22 M.R.S.A. § 4309.4).

ents for general assistance will be informed that until he or she reaches the age of twenty-one (21), the minor's parents are still legally liable for his/her support (19 M.R.S.A. § 441-443) and the municipality has the right to seek recovery from the parents of the cost of all assistance granted to the minor, at least to the extent his/her parents are financially capable of repaying the municipality (22 M.R.S.A. § 4319). With regard to any such application, the municipality may seek verification of the minor's need for general assistance by contacting his/her parents (City of Bangor v. DHS, Penob. Cty #CV-90-28). If the applicant's parents declare a willingness to provide the applicant with his/her basic needs directly, and there is no convincing evidence that the applicant would be jeopardized by relying on his/her parents for basic needs, the administrator may find the applicant to be in no need for general assistance for the reason that his/her needs are being provided by a legally liable relative.
(c) Mental or physical disability. Each applicant who has a mental or physical disability must make a good faith effort to utilize any medical or rehabilitative services which have been recommended by a physician and which are available to the applicant provided they would not constitute a financial burden or create a physical risk to the individual.
(d) Written notice; disqualification. The administrator will give each applicant written notice that he/she is required to utilize any potential resources. Any applicant who refuses to utilize potential resources, without just cause, after receiving a written seven-day notice will be ineligible for further assistance until he/she has made a good faith effort to utilize the resources.
General assistance will not be withheld from the applicant pending receipt of a resource if the applicant has made, or is in the process of making, a good faith effort to obtain the resource.
(e) Forfeiture of benefits. Any applicant who forfeits receipt of or causes a reduction in benefits from another public assistance program due to fraud, misrepresentation, or a knowing or intentional violation of program rules sixty (60) days prior to applying for general assistance will be ineligible to receive general assistance to replace the forfeited benefits. The worth of the forfeited benefits will be considered income that is available to the appli-
Supp. No. 4 352
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-58
cant sixty (60) days from the date of applying for general assistance. This ineligibility will not apply to any person who has forfeited such benefits prior to filing an initial application (22
M.R.S.A. § 4317), nor will it disqualify eligible dependents (22
M.R.S.A. § 4309.3). (Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-58. Period of disqualification.
(a) Generally. No one will have his/her assistance terminated, reduced, or suspended prior to being given written notice and an opportunity for a fair hearing (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4321, 4322). Each person will be notified in writing of the reasons for his/her ineligibility, and if disqualified for not complying with this chapter, the period of disqualification.
(b) Work requirement. People who do not comply with a work requirement are disqualified from receiving assistance for a period of ninety (90) days (unless they regain their eligibility; see section 5-55, 5-56). People who do not comply with the work requirement and are disqualified before the period covered by the grant of assistance expires shall be disqualified for ninety (90) days following the end of the period covered by the assistance grant. People who do not comply with a work requirement and are disqualified after the period covered by the grant of assistance expires may be disqualified for ninety (90) days from the date of the written notice of disqualification. The administrator shall give recipients written notice that they are disqualified as soon as the administrator has sufficient knowledge and information to render a decision of disqualification.
(c) Fraud. People who commit fraud are disqualified from receiving assistance for a period of ninety (90) days (see section 5-64). The administrator will notify recipients that they are disqualified as soon as the administrator has sufficient knowledge and information to render a decision. If a disqualification for fraud is issued before the expiration of a grant of assistance, the period of disqualification shall commence on the day following the end of the period covered by the grant of assistance or on the day the fair hearing authority renders its decision, whichever is later. If fraud is discovered after the period covered by the grant of assistance
Supp. No. 4 353
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-58 DEXTER CODE
has expired, the period of ineligibility will commence on the day of the written notice of disqualification, unless subsequently modified by the fair hearing authority.

Secs. 5·59, 5-60. Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY
Sec. 5-61. Recognition of dignity and rights.
Any determination or investigation into an applicant's eligibility will be conducted in a manner that will not violate the applicant's privacy or personal dignity or violate his/her individual rights.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-62. Determination; redetermination.
The administrator will make an individual, factual determination of eligibility each time a person applies or reapplies for general assistance. The administrator will make a redetermination of eligibility at least monthly but may do so as often as necessary to administer the program efficiently and meet the needs of the applicants. Upon any application, the administrator will determine the applicant's eligibility on the basis of a thirty-day prospective analysis, but may elect to disburse that applicant's assistance periodically, e.g., weekly, throughout a thirty-day period of eligibility pursuant to that initial eligibility determination.
The administrator may re-determine a person's eligibility at any time during the period he/she is receiving assistance if the administrator is notified of any change in the recipient's circumstances which may after the amount of assistance which the recipient may receive. Once a recipient has been granted assistance, the administrator may not reduce or rescind the grant without giving prior written notice to the recipient explaining the reasons for the decision and offering the recipient an opportunity
Supp. No. 4 354
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-63
to appeal the decision to the fair hearing authority (22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4309).
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3·5-92)
Sec. 5-63. Verification.
(a) Applicant's responsibility. Each applicant and recipient has the responsibility at the time of application and continuing thereafter to provide complete, accurate and current information and documentation concerning his/her need, income, use of income, expenses, and any changes in information previously reported on the application. The administrator will require documentation of the applicant's income, use of income, assets and resources plus actual bills and receipts for rent, utilities, fuel, telephone, medical services and other basic necessities that are reasonably obtainable. The recipient is responsible for notifying the administrator of any changes in his/her household or income that may affect his/her eligibility.
When determining an applicant's eligibility, the administrator will seek all necessary information first from the applicant. Information needed from other sources, with the exception of public records, will be gathered only with the knowledge and consent of the applicant (22 M.R.S.A § 4309.1-B).
(b) Decision. If an applicant does not have the necessary information at the time of application, the administrator will give him/her the opportunity to provide the information prior to the expiration of the twenty-four-hour period within which the administrator must act on the application. If all the necessary information has been provided and the applicant is eligible, assistance will be granted. Ifthe applicant does not provide the required information needed within the twenty-four-hour period, and the administrator cannot determine the applicant's eligibility, the applicant will be denied assistance for that reason (22 M.R.S.A. § 4309.1-B).
(c) Denial of assistance. The administrator will not grant assistance to any applicant who refuses to supply necessary information and documentation concerning his/her needs, income and other resources, or who refuses to grant permission for the administrator to contact other persons to verify the information. If
Supp. No. 4 355
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-63 DEXTER CODE
the administrator has attempted to verify the information but is unable to determine if the applicant is eligible because the applicant has refused to provide or allow the administrator to verify the necessary information, the applicant will be denied assistance until the necessary verification has been accomplished (22
M.R.S.A. § 4309.1-B).
(d) Right to verify. It is the administrator's responsibility to determine and verify the eligibility of each applicant. The administrator may seek and verify information from all appropriate sources including, but not limited to: the Department of Human Services and any other department of the state having information that has a bearing on an applicant's eligibility, financial institutions, employers, landlords, physicians, and legally liable relatives. The administrator will request the applicant's written consent authorizing the administrator to receive the necessary information (22 M.R.S.A. § 4314).
(e) Penalty for refusing to release information. Any person who is required but who refuses to provide necessary information to the administrator after it has been requested must state in writing the reasons for the refusal within three (3) days of receiving the request. Any person who refuses to provide the information, without just cause, commits a civil violation and may be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) which may be adjudged in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any person who willfully renders false information to the administrator is guilty of a Class E crime (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4314.5, 4314.6, 4315).
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-64. Fraud.
(a) Generally. It is unlawful for a person to make knowingly and willfully a false representation of a material fact to the administrator in order to receive general assistance or cause someone else to receive general assistance (22 M.R.S.A. § 4315). A material fact is any information which has direct bearing on the person's eligibility. False representation shall consist of any individual knowingly and willfully:
(1) Making a false statement to the general assistance administrator, either orally or in writing, in order to obtain as-
Supp. No. 4 356
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-64
sistance to which the applicant or the applicant's household is not entitled;
(2) Concealing information from the general assistance admin· istrator in order to obtain assistance to which the applicant or applicant's household is not entitled; or
(3) Using general assistance benefits for a purpose other than that for which they were intended.
No person may be denied assistance solely for making a false representation prior to being given an opportunity for a fair hearing.
(b) Period of ineligibility. When the general assistance administrator finds that a person has knowingly and willfully misrepresented material facts for the purpose of making himself or herself eligible for general assistance, the administrator shall notify that applicant in writing that he or she has been disqualified from receiving assistance for ninety (90) days. For the purpose of this section, a material misrepresentation is a false statement about an eligibility factor in the absence of which some or all of the assistance would not be or would not have been granted. The notification of disqualification issued by the administrator shall inform the applicant of his/her right to appeal the administrator's decision to the fair hearing authority within five (5) working days of receipt. Unless modified by the fair hearing authority, the period of ineligibility shall commence on the day following the end of the period covered by the grant of assistance fraudulently received or upon the date of notification of disqualification, whichever is later.
(cl Right to a fair hearing. Any applicant who is denied assistance for making a false representation will be afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision to the fair hearing authority in accordance with Article VII of this chapter. No recipient shall have his/her assistance reduced or revoked during the period of eligibility before being notified and given the opportunity to ap· peal the decision. Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the fair hearing authority may appeal that decision to the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 80-B (22 M.R.S.A. § 4309.3).
Supp. No. 4 357
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-64 DEXTER CODE
(d) Reimbursement. If a recipient does not appeal the decision or if the fair hearing authority determines that a recipient did make a false representation, he/she will be required to reimburse the municipality for any assistance received to which he/she was not entitled.
(e) Dependents. In no event will the disqualification of a person under this section serve to disqualify any eligible dependent in that household (22 M.R.S.A. § 4315). In the event one (1) or more members of a household are disqualified and assistance is requested for the remaining dependents, the eligibility of those dependents will be calculated as though the household is comprised of the dependents only, except that the entire household income will be considered available to them.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5·65. Period of eligibility.
The administrator will grant assistance to all eligible persons for a period that is sufficient to meet their need but in no event may a grant of assistance cover a period in excess of one (1) month (22 M.R.S.A. § 4309). Upon any application the administrator will determine the applicant's eligibility on the basis of a thirty-day prospective analysis. For reasons of administrative efficiency, however, the administrator may elect to disburse that applicant's assistance for shorter periods of time, such as weekly, throughout the thirty-day period of eligibility. When the administrator elects to disburse general assistance for a period of time less than thirty
(30) days, subsequent grants of assistance during that thirty-day period may be issued pursuant to the initial determination of need unless the applicant's financial situation changes substantially enough to warrant a redetermination of eligibility.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5·66. Determination of need.
(a) Generally. The period of time used to calculate need will be the next thirty-day period from the date of application (22
M.R.S.A. § 4301.7). The administrator will calculate applicants' expenses according to the actual expense of the basic necessity or the maximum levels for the specific necessities allowed in section
Supp. No. 4 358
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-66
5-68, whichever is less. Applicants will not be considered eligible if their income and other resources exceeds this calculation except in an emergency (see section 4.9, 22 M.R.S.A. § 4308.2).
Applicants will also not be considered in need of general assistance if their income, property, credit, assets or other resources available to provide basic necessities for their household are greater than the applicable overall maximum level of assistance set forth in the beginning of section 5-68 (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301.10, 4305.3-B). The difference between the applicant's income/resources and the overall maximum levels of assistance established by this chapter is the applicant's deficit. Once an applicant's deficit has been determined, the specific maximum levels of assistance for each basic necessity listed in section 5-68 shall be used by the administrator to guide the distribution of assistance for which the applicant is eligible. The specific maximum levels of assistance for each basic necessity are intended to be reasonable and sufficient to help recipients maintain a standard of health and decency (22 M.R.S.A. § 4305.3-A).
(b) Income for basic necessities. Applicants are required to use their income for basic necessities. Except for initial applicants, no applicant is eligible to receive assistance to replace income that was spent within the thirty-day period prior to an application for assistance on goods and services that are not basic necessities. All income spent on goods and services that are not basic necessities will be considered available to the applicant and combined with the applicant's prospective thirty-day income for the purposes of computing eligibility (22 M.R.S.A. §4315-A). Applicants who have sufficient income to provide their basic necessities but who use that income to purchase goods or services which are not basic necessities will not be considered eligible for assistance. Persons who exhaust their income on basic necessities and who still need assistance with other basic necessities will be eligible, provided that their income does not exceed the overall maximum level of assistance.
(c) Use-of-income requirements. Except for initial applicants, anyone applying for general assistance must document their use of income to the administrator. This documentation can take the form of check stubs and/or receipts which demonstrate that the applicant has used his/her income for basic necessities.
Supp. No. 4 359
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-66 DEXTER CODE
Allowable expenditures include reasonable shelter costs (rent/ mortgage); the cost of heating fuel, electricity, and food up to the ordinance maximums; telephone costs at the base rate if the household needs a telephone for medical reasons, the costs of nonelective medical services as recommended by a physician which are not otherwise covered by medical entitlement or insurance; the reasonable cost of essential clothing and nonprescription drugs, and the costs of any other commodity or service determined essential by the administrator.
Cable television, cigarettes/alcohol, gifts purchased, costs of trips or vacations, court fines paid, repayments of unsecured loans, credit card debt, costs associated with pet care, etc. are not con· sidered basic necessities and will not be included in the budget computation.
The municipality reserves the right to apply specific use-of· income requirements to any applicant, other than an initial applicant, who fails to use his/her income for basic necessities or fails to reasonably document his/her use of income (22 M.R.S.A § 4315-A). Those additional requirements will be applied in the following manner:
(1) The administrator may require the applicant to use some or all of his/her income, at the time it becomes available, toward specific basic necessities. The administrator may prioritize such required expenditures so that most or all of the applicant's income is applied to housing (i.e., rent/ mortgage), energy (i.e., heating fuel, electricity), or other specified basic necessities.
(2) The administrator will notify applicants in writing of the specific use-of-income requirements placed on them.
(3) If upon subsequent application it cannot be determined how the applicant's income was spent, or it is determined that some or all of applicant's income was not spent as directed and was also not spent on basic necessities, the applicant will not be eligible to receive either regular or emergency general assistance to replace that income.
(4) If the applicant does not spend his/her income as directed, but can show with verifiable documentation that all in-
Supp. No. 4 360
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-66
come was spent on basic necessities up to allowed amounts, the applicant will remain eligible to the extent of the applicant's eligibility and need.
(d) Computation of income and expenses. In determining eligi· bility the administrator will subtract the applicant's net income from the overall maximum level of assistance found at the begin· ning of section 5-68. If income is greater than the overall max· imum level of assistance, the applicant will not be eligible except in an emergency (see section 5-39).
The municipality will provide assistance in an amount up to the deficit to the extent the applicant is in need of basic necessi· ties. The municipality will not grant assistance in excess of the maximum amounts allowed in section 5-68 of this chapter, except in an emergency or when the administrator elects to consolidate the applicant's unmet need, as provided immediately below.
(e) Consolidation of deficit. AB a general rule and to the extent of their deficit, applicants will be eligible for assistance for any basic necessity up to, but not exceeding, the maximum amount allowed for that necessity in this chapter or the actual thirty-day cost of the necessity, whichever is less. Under certain circumstances, however, and in accordance with the following condi· tions, the administrator may consolidate the applicant's deficit and apply it toward a basic necessity in an amount greater than the chapter maximum for that necessity.
(1) The practice of consolidating the deficit and applying it toward a basic necessity in amounts greater than the chapter maximum shall be the exception rather than the rule;
(2) The total general assistance grant cannot exceed the total deficit unless the applicant is in an emergency situation; and
(3) The need for the application of the recipient's consolidated deficit toward a basic necessity was not created by the recipient misspending his or her income or resources in violation of the use-of-income requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. No. C92·5, 3-5-92)
Supp. No. 4 361
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-67 DEXTER CODE
Sec. 5·67. Income.
(a) Income standards. Applicants whose income exceeds the overall maximum level of assistance provided in section 5-68 shall not be eligible for general assistance except in an emergency. The administrator will conduct an individual factual inquiry into the applicant's income and expenses each time they apply.
(b) Calculation of income. To determine whether applicants are in need, the administrator will calculate the income they will receive during the next thirty-day period commencing on the date of application and any assets or resources that would alleviate their need. For all applicants other than initial applicants, the administrator will also consider as available income any income that was not spent during the previous thirty-day period on basic necessities, as well as any income that was spent on basic necessities in unreasonable excess of the chapter maximums for specific basic necessities. If their income exceeds the amount they need for basic necessities, up to the maximum levels contained in section 5-68, applicants will not be considered in need. Exceptions will be made in emergency situations which may necessitate that the maximum levels be exceeded (22 M.R.S.A § 4308; see section 5-39). To calculate weekly income and expenses, the administrator will divide the applicants' monthly income and expenses by 4.3.
(c) Types of income. Income which will be considered in deter· mining an applicant's need includes:
(1) Earned income. Income in cash or in kind earned by the applicant through wages, salary, commissions, or profit, whether self-employed or as an employee, is considered earned income. If a person is self-employed, total income will be computed by subtracting business expenses from gross income. When income consists of wages, the amount computed will be that available after taxes, social security and other payroll deductions required by state, federal, and local law. Rental income and profit from produce that is sold is considered earned income. Income that is held in trust and unavailable to the applicant or the applicant's dependents will not be considered as earned income.
NOTE: Actual work-related expenses such as union dues, transportation to and from work, special equipment or work
Supp. No. 4 362
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-67
clothes, and child care costs will not be considered available income and will be deducted (22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.7).
(2) Income from other assistance or social services programs. State categorical assistance benefits, SSI payments, Social Security payments, VA benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, and payments from other government sources will be considered as income, unless expressly prohibited by federal law or regulation. Federal law prohibits Food Stamps and fuel assistance payments made by the Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP and EPIC) from being considered income. The value of the food stamps or fuel assistance will not be used to reduce the amount of general assistance the applicant is eligible to receive, although applicants may have only a limited or reduced need for gen· era! assistance for heating fuel or electricity if a recently received HEAP/ECIP benefit has sufficiently credited their account or otherwise obviated an actual fuel-related cost over the prospective thirty-day period. The administrator's obligation is to always compute the heating needs of an applicant who has received HEAP or ECIP as if that applicant paid for his/her total fuel costs. Accordingly, in such cases, the administrator will budget for the household's heating energy needs according to actual usage, up to the chapter maximums, but the administrator may, with written notice to the applicant, hold in reserve the heating energy portion of the applicant's deficit until such a time during the period of eligibility that the applicant has a demonstrable need for the disbursement of heating energy assistance; that is, the applicant's fuel tank can accept a minimum fuel delivery or the applicant no longer has a positive credit balance with his/her utility company. The municipality is not obligated to divert any recipient's heating energy allowance toward non-heating purposes solely on the basis of the recipient's receipt of HEAP/ECIP.
(3) Court-ordered support payments. Alimony and child sup· port payments will be considered income only if actually received by the applicant. The general assistance admin· istrator will refer cases where support payments are not
Supp. No. 4 363
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-67 DEXTER CODE
actually received to the State Department of Human Services' Support Enforcement Location Unit.
(4) Income from other sources. Payments from pensions and trust funds will be considered income. Payments from boarders or lodgers will be considered income as will cash or in-kind contributions provided to the household from any other source, including relatives (22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.7).
(5) Earnings of a son or daughter. Earned income received by sons and daughters below the age of eighteen (18) who are full-time students and who are not working full-time will not be considered income. The unearned income of a minor in the household will be considered available to the house· hold.
(6) Income from household members. Income from household members will be considered available to the applicant, whether or not the household member is legally obligated for the support of the applicant, if the household members pool or share their income and expenses as a family or intermingle their funds so as to provide support to one another (Boisvert v. Lewiston, Andro. Sup. Ct. CV#B0-436).
(7) The pooling or non-pooling of income. When two (2) or more individuals share the same dwelling unit but not all members of the household are applying for general assistance, the administrator shall make a finding under a rebuttable presumption that the entire household is pooling income (22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.12-A). One (1) or more applicants for assistance can successfully rebut the presumption that all household income is being pooled by providing the administrator with verifiable documentation affirmatively demonstrating a pattern of non-pooling for the duration of the shared living arrangement. Such documentation would include evidence of the entire household expenses as well as bank statements, check stubs, receipts, landlord statements or other vendor accounts clearly supporting a claim that the applicant has been and is presently solely and entirely responsible for his or her pro-rata share of household costs. If the applicant is unable to successfully rebut the municipality's presumption that all household income
Supp. No. 4 364
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-67
is being pooled, eligibility of the entire household will be determined based on total household income. If the applicant successfully rebuts the municipality's presumption that all household income is being pooled, the applicant's eligibility will be determined on the basis of his/her income and his/her pro-rata share of actual household expenses.
(8) Lump sum income. A lump sum payment received by a household in the thirty-day period prior to the date of application for general assistance shall be considered as income available to the household, with the exception of any required payments (i.e., any third party payment which is required as a condition of receiving the lump sum payment, or any payments of bills earmarked for the purpose for which the lump sum payment was made) and any amount of the lump sum payment which the applicant can document was spent on basic necessities, as described below.
In the case where a lump sum payment was received by a household at any time prior to the date of application for general assistance, the administrator may also assess the possibility of prorating an applicant's eligibility for general assistance according to the criteria of 22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.7.
The lump sum proration only applies to applicants who:
(1) Are not initial applicants; and
(2) Had notice, prior to receiving the lump sum payment, of the municipal authority to prorate eligibility.
If these conditions are met, determine the lump sum proration as follows:
(1) Subtract from the lump sum payment all required payments;
(2) Subtract from the lump sum any amount the applicant can demonstrate was spent on basic necessities, including all basic necessities provided by general assistance up to the specific maximum levels of assistance, per month, provided in this chapter; payment of funeral or burial
Supp. No. 19 365
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-67 DEXTER CODE
expenses for a family member; travel costs related to the illness or death of a family member; repair or replacement of essentials lost due to fire, flood or other natural disaster; repair or purchase of a motor vehicle essential for employment, education, training or other day-to-day living necessities (22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.7).
(3) Divide the remaining amount by the applicant's maximum monthly allocation of general assistance.
The dividend remaining after following the above guidelines represents the number of months from the receipt of the lump sum payment that the applicant(s) will not be eligible for nonemergency general assistance, except no proration of eligibility can extend longer than twelve (12) months from the date of application. Applicants who have been declared ineligible for reasons of lump sum proration shall be eligible for emergency general assistance during the period of proration according to the standards at section 5-39 of this chapter.
The administrator shall provide notice to all applicants of the municipality's authority to prorate eligibility in the above manner.
(Ord. No. C92-5, 3-5-92)
Sec. 5-68. Basic necessities; maximum levels of assistance.
(a) Overall maximum levels of assistance. Notwithstanding any of the maximum levels of assistance for specific basic necessities listed in this section, an applicant's eligibility for general assistance will be first determined by subtracting his/her income from the overall maximum level of assistance designated immediately below for the applicable household size (22 M.R.S.A. § 4305.3-B). The difference yielded by this calculation shall be the applicant's deficit. Applicants will be eligible for general assistance up to the calculated deficit to the extent the applicant is unable to otherwise provide the basic necessities essential to maintain themselves or their families. Applicants with no deficit shall be found ineligible for general assistance unless they are in an emergency, in which case eligibility for emergency general assistance will be determined according to section 5-39 of this chapter.
Supp. No. 19 366
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
The maximum levels of assistance shall be the maximum amount allowable under state law.
(b) Maximum levels of assistance for specific basic necessities. The municipality will grant assistance to eligible applicants for basic necessities according to the maximum levels for specific types of assistance set forth below. The administrator, in consultation with the applicant, may apply the amount of the applicant's deficit toward assistance with any one (1) or combination of necessities not to exceed the total deficit. These maximum levels will be strictly adhered to although if the administrator determines that there are exceptional circumstances and an emergency is shown to exist, these absolute levels will be waived in order to meet immediate needs (Glidden v. Town of Fairfield, Som. Sup. Ct. CV# 79-17). In all cases either the actual expenses the applicant incurs for basic necessities or the maximum amount allowed in each category, whichever is less, will be used in determining need.
The applicant's need for common living expenses for food, rent, fuel, etc. will be presumed to be reduced by an amount equal to the other household members' proportionate fair share of the common living expenses. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the other household members had no income with which to pay their share of common expenses. No applicant will be allowed to claim a need for any expense which in fact, has been or will be paid by another person, or which has been incurred in another person's name.
(1) Food. The administrator will provide food assistance to eligible persons up to the allowed maximum amounts designated by the U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan for the appropriate household size. For this purpose, the municipality hereby incorporates by reference the U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan, as distributed by the Maine Department of Human Services on or about October of each year. In determining need for food the administrator will not consider the value of the food stamps an applicant receives as income (22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.7(A); Dupler v. City of Portland, U.S. Dist. Ct. CV# 74-134 SD). The municipality will authorize vouchers to be used solely for approved food products.
The maximum amounts allowed for food are the maximum amount allowable under state law.
Supp. No. 28 367
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-68 DEXTER CODE
The administrator will exceed the above maximums when necessary for households having members with special dietary needs. The administrator may require a doctor's statement which verifies that there is a special dietary need that requires an expenditure for food which is greater than the chapter maximums.
(2) Housing. The administrator will provide assistance with rent or mortgage payments that are reasonable and within the allowed maximum levels below. It is the applicant's responsibility to find suitable housing, although the administrator may help the applicant find housing when appropriate. The administrator will inform the applicant of the allowed housing maximums to assist him/her in his/her search for housing. The allowed maximum for any applicant will be the categorical housing maximum representing the minimum dwelling unit space necessary to adequately shelter the applicant household. Applicants requesting assistance for housing that contains more bedrooms than are necessary for the number of household members will be provided assistance according to the maximum level for the number of rooms actually needed.
(c) Rental payments to relatives. The municipality will not authorize any rental payment to an applicant's relatives unless the rental relationship has existed for at least three (3) months and the applicant's relative(s) rely on the rental payment for their basic needs. For the purpose of this section, a "relative" is defined as the applicant's parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, parent's siblings, or any of those relative's children (22 M.R.S.A. § 4319(2)).
(d) Rental payments to private homes. When applicants living in private homes or sharing dwelling units with other people who are not requesting general assistance, the amount allowed as the applicant's shelter expense will be the applicant's prorata share of the actual, total shelter cost, up to the chapter maximum (22
M.R.S.A. § 4301.6).
Any housing assistance issued to a recipient in such a circumstance shall be issued, whenever reasonably possible, to the landlord or property owner with most superior legal or equitable interest in the property.
Supp. No. 28 368
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
When the municipality issues in aggregate more than six hundred dollars ($600.00) in rental payments to any landlord in any calendar year, a 1099 form declaring the total amount of
rental payments during the calendar year will be issued to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to IRS regulation. See Section 6041(a) of Internal Revenue Code.
Any landlord wishing to regularly receive rental payments from the municipality on behalf of applicants renting rooms from the landlord's own residence must, at a minimum, obtain a lodging license from the Department of Human Services, Division of Health Engineering, pursuant to 10-144A Code of Maine Regulations, Chapter 201, as a condition of that landlord receiving future general assistance payments on behalf of his or her tenants.
(e) Mortgage payments. In the case of a request for assistance with a mortgage payment, the general assistance administrator will make an individual factual determination of whether the applicant has an immediate need for such aid. In making this determination, the administrator will consider the extent and liquidity of the applicant's proprietary interest in the housing. Factors to consider in making this determination include:
(1) The marketability of the shelter's equity;
(2) The amount of equity;
(3) The availability of the equity interest in the shelter to provide the applicant an opportunity to secure a shortterm loan in order to meet immediate needs;
(4) The extent to which liquidation may aid the applicant's financial rehabilitation;
(5) A comparison between the amount of mortgage obligations and the anticipated rental charges the applicant would be responsible for if he/she were to be dislocated to rental housing;
(6) The imminence of the applicant's dislocation from owned housing because of his/her inability to meet the mortgage payments.
Supp. No. 28 369
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-68 DEXTER CODE
(7) The likelihood that the provision of housing assistance will prevent such dislocation; and
(8) The applicant's age, health, and social situation.
These factors shall be considered when determining whether the equity in the shelter is an available asset which may be substituted for the assistance the municipality would otherwise be required to provide. If after reviewing the above criteria the administrator determines that the payment of the mortgage is not necessary to meet the applicant's immediate shelter needs, the administrator may elect not to make any mortgage payment unless the applicant has been served a notice of foreclosure, although mortgage payments up to the chapter maximum for housing, will be budgeted as an expense.
Ifa mortgage payment is necessary, the administrator will pay the actual amount due, up to the amount allowed according to the maximum levels listed below, whichever is less. After an initial application, assistance with such payments will be given only after the applicant has made all reasonable efforts to borrow against the equity of his/her home. If there is not sufficient equity in the home with which to secure a loan, and if the monthly mortgage payments are not realistically in line with the rental rates for similar housing in the area that could meet the applicant's needs, the administrator will inform the applicant that he/she is responsible for finding alternative housing within his/her ability to pay and will be obligated to make all reasonable efforts to secure such housing.
(f) Liens. When the municipality makes mortgage payments, the municipality may place a lien on the property in order to recover its costs of granting assistance with mortgage payments (22 M.R.S.A. § 4320). No lien may be enforced against a recipient except upon his/her death or the transfer of the property. Further, no lien may be enforced against a person who is currently receiving any form of public assistance or who would again become eligible for general assistance if the lien were enforced.
If the municipality determines that it is appropriate to place a lien on a person's property to recover its costs of providing general assistance for a mortgage payment it must file a notice of the lien
Supp. No. 28 370
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
with the county register of deeds where the property is located within thirty (30) days of making the mortgage payment. That filing shall secure the municipality's or the state's interest in an amount equal to the sum of that mortgage payment and all subsequent mortgage payments made on behalf of the same eligible person. Not less than ten (10) days prior to filing the lien notice in the registry, the municipal officers must send a different notice to the owner of the real estate, the general assistance recipient, and any record holder of the mortgage by certified mail, return receipt requested, that a lien on the property is going to be filed with the registry. This notice must clearly inform the recipient of the limitations upon enforcement plus the name, title, address and telephone number of the person who granted the assistance. The municipal officers must also give written notice to the recipient each time the amount secured by the lien is increased because of an additional mortgage payment or the imposition of interest. This notice must include the same information that appeared on the original notice of proposed filing sent to the recipient.
The municipality will charge interest on the amount of money secured by the lien. The municipal officers will establish the interest rate not to exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by the State Treasurer. The interest will accrue from the date the lien is filed.
(g) Property taxes. In the event an applicant requests assistance with his/her property taxes, the administrator will inform the applicant that there are two (2) procedures on the local level to request that relief: the poverty abatement process (36 MRSA
§ 841(2)) and general assistance. If the applicant chooses to seek property tax assistance through general assistance, or if the applicant is denied a poverty tax abatement, the administrator may consider using general assistance to meet this need only if:
(1) The property tax in question is for the applicant's place of residence;
(2) There is a tax lien on the property which is due to mature within sixty (60) days of the date of application;
Supp. Na. 28 371
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-68 DEXTER CODE
(3) As a matter of policy or practice it is reasonably certain that a tax lien foreclosure will result in subsequent eviction from the residential property; and
(4) The applicant, with sufficient notice, applies for property tax relief through the Maine Resident Property Tax Program, when available.
The maximum levels of housing assistance contained in this chapter have been derived either from a locally accomplished fair market rental survey or the fair market rental values developed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (IDJD). If the maximum levels of housing are derived from the HUD values as those values are prepared and distributed by the Maine Department of Human Services on or about November 1of each year are hereby incorporated by reference. If and when the maximum levels of housing contained in this chapter are derived from a locally developed fair market rental survey, a record of that survey will be submitted to the Department of Human Services, General Assistance Unit, and the maximum levels of housing assistance will be incorporated into this chapter pursuant to the ordinance adoption and amendment procedures found at 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305.
The maximum amounts allowed for housing are the maximum amount allowable under state law.
(h) Utilities. Expenses for lights, cooking, and hot water will be budgeted separately if they are not included in the rent. Applicants are responsible for making arrangements with the utility company regarding service, including entering into a special payment arrangement if necessary.
Assistance will be granted to eligible applicants on the basis of their most recent bill. The municipality is not obligated to pay back bills or utility security deposits. Exceptions may be made in emergency situations pursuant to section 5-39. Disconnection of utility service will not be considered an emergency in all cases. The administrator will make an individual, factual analysis to determine if the termination of utility service constitutes an emergency. The administrator will consider the household composition, the time of year, the health of the household members, and other appropriate factors in reaching a decision. Applicants
Supp. No. 28 372
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
who had sufficient income, money, assets or other resources to pay their utility bill when it was received, but who spent all or part of their income on items which were not basic necessities, will not be eligible to receive general assistance to replace those funds. Applicants have the burden of providing evidence of their income for the applicable time period (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308.2, see section 5-39). The administrator will notify applicants in writing that they must give the administrator prompt notice if their utility service is to be terminated or if their fuel supply is low. It is the applicant's responsibility to attempt to make arrangements with the utility company to maintain their service and to notify the administrator if assistance is needed with a utility bill prior to service being terminated.
The maximum amounts allowed for utilities including lights, cooking, and hot water are the maximum amount allowable under state law.
In accordance with the following conditions, the administrator may allow as a budgetable expense the amount of an applicant's summer-loaded special payment arrangement (SPA) or budget payment arrangement (BPA), as calculated by the electric utility and entered into by the applicant, even when the arranged payment amount exceeds the above maximums or actual usage:
(1) The SPA or BPA, when annualized, does not exceed the above monthly maximums, when annualized, for nonelectrically heated dwelling units.
(2) The SPA or BPA, when annualized, does not exceed the above monthly maximums and the fuel assistance maximums, when annualized, for electrically heated dwelling units.
(3) The administrator determines, in consultation with the utility, that the payment arrangement does not include in any part the installment payment of past debt unless the municipality guaranteed to the utility the allowance of such an arrangement as a condition of averting a disconnection.
Pursuant to the use-of-income requirements in section 5-66 of this chapter, whenever the administrator budgets for SPA's or
Supp. No. 28 373
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-68 DEXTER CODE
BPA's under this section, the recipient will be required to pay the SPA or BPA him or herself to the extent of the income capability of the household.
Nonelectric utilities. The allowed amount for water and sewer utility service will be budgeted at the actual thirty-day cost for those services.
(i) Fuel. Expenses for home heating will be budgeted according to the actual need for fuel during the heating season (September through May) provided such expenses are reasonable, and at other times during the year when the administrator determines the request for fuel assistance is reasonable and appropriate.
Assistance will be granted to eligible applicants on the basis of their most recent bill. The municipality is not responsible for back bills except in an emergency as provided in section 5-39. Applicants are responsible for monitoring their fuel supply and requesting assistance prior to depleting their fuel supply. When applicants who have been informed of this responsibility run out of fuel nonetheless, and can show no just cause for failing to give the administrator timely notice of their need for fuel, the administrator shall find that the emergency was not beyond the applicants' control, and process the emergency request accordingly, pursuant to section 5-39 of this chapter.
When considering requests for fuel, eligible applicants will be granted assistance with the actual amount necessary up to the following maximums: the maximum amount allowable under state law.
When fuel such as wood, coal and/or natural gas are used to heat, they will be budgeted at actual rates, if they are reasonable. No eligible applicant shall be considered to need more than seven
(7) tons of coal per year, eight (8) cords of wood per year or one hundred twenty-six thousand (126,000) cubic feet of natural gas per year.
(j) Personal care and household supplies. Expenses for ordinary personal and household supplies will be budgeted and allowed according to the applicant's actual need for these items, up to the maximum amount allowable under state law.. Personal and household supplies include: hand soap, toothpaste, shampoo,
Supp. No. 28 374
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
shaving cream, deodorant, dish detergent, laundry supplies and costs, household cleaning supplies, razors, paper products such as toilet paper, tissues, paper towels, garbage/trash bags, and light bulbs.
Additional persons in the household will be budgeted at one dollar and twenty-five cents ($1.25) per week or five dollars ($5.00) a month.
When an applicant can verify expenditures for the following items, a special supplement will be budgeted as necessary for households with children under six (6) years of age for items such as cloth or disposable diapers, laundry powder, oil, shampoo, and ointment up to the following amounts: the maximum amount allowable under state law.
(k) Other basic necessities. Expenses falling under this section will be granted when they are deemed essential to an applicant's or recipient's health and safety by the general assistance administrator and, in some cases, upon verification by a physician. Assistance will be granted only when these necessities cannot be obtained through the utilization of available resources.
(1) Clothing. The municipality may assist a household with the purchase of adequate clothing. Before assistance will be granted for clothing, the general assistance administrator must be satisfied that the applicant has utilized all available resources to secure the necessary clothing. In some circumstances, clothing will be a postponable item. Exceptions to this would be, for example, if fire or unusual cold weather makes extra clothing an immediate necessity, special clothing is necessary for the applicant's employment, or a household member is without adequate clothing.
Supp. No. 28 375
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
(2) Medical. The municipality will pay for essential medical expenses, other than hospital bills (see below), provided that the municipality is notified and approves the expenses and services prior to their being made or delivered. The municipality will grant assistance for medical service only when assistance cannot be obtained from any other source and the applicant would not be able to receive necessary medical care without the municipality's assistance. The applicant is required to utilize any resource, including any federal or state program, that will diminish his/her need to seek general assistance for medical expenses. The municipality will grant assistance for nonemergency medical services only if a physician verifies that the services are essential. The administrator may require a second medical opinion from a physician designated by the municipality at the municipality's expense to verify the necessity of the services.
Ordinary medical supplies/nonprescription drugs will be budgeted at the actual amount when the applicant can demonstrate a need for such items. Allowable supplies include bandages, aspirin, cough syrup, and other generic brand, nonprescription medicines. In addition, the basic monthly rate for telephone service will be budgeted when a telephone is essential to the health and safety of the household. In order for telephone service to be considered an allowable expense the applicant must provide a written statement from physician certifying that the telephone is essential.
(3) Hospital bills. In the event of an emergency admission to the hospital, the hospital must notify the administrator within five (5) business days of the admission. Notification must be by telephone, confirmed by certified mail, or by certified mail only. If a hospital fails to give timely notice to the administrator the municipality will have no obligation to pay the bill.
Any person who cannot pay his/her hospital bill must apply to the hospital for consideration under the hospital's charity care program as provided in Title 22 M.R.S.A. § 396-F(l).
Supp. No. 4 377
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-68 DEXTER CODE
Anyone who is not eligible for the hospital's charity care program may apply for general assistance. Applicants must apply for assistance within thirty (30) days of being discharged from the hospital and provide a notice from the hospital certifying that they are not eligible for the hospital's charity care program.
Before the administrator will consider whether to allow a hospital bill as a necessary expense, the applicant must enter into a reasonable payment arrangement with the hospital. The payment arrangement will be based upon the Medicaid rate. In determining an applicant's eligibility the municipality will budget the monthly payment to the hospital the applicant has agreed to pay. The applicant's need for assistance with a hospital bill will be considered each time he/she applies by including the amount of the bill in the applicant's monthly budget, but the recipient will be responsible for making any necessary payments to the hospital pursuant to the use-of-income requirements found at section 5-66 of this chapter.
(4) Dental. The municipality will pay for medically necessary dental services only. If full mouth extractions are necessary, the municipality will pay for dentures provided the applicant has no other resources to pay for the dentures. The applicant will be referred to a dental clinic in the area whenever possible. The administrator will expect the applicant to bear a reasonable part of the cost for dental services, including extractions and dentures, taking into account the applicant's ability to pay.
(5) Eye care. In order to be eligible to receive general assistance for-eyeglasses, an applicant must have his/her medical need certified by a person licensed to practice optometry. The general assistance administrator will provide assistance for eyeglasses to eligible persons only after the applicant has exhausted all other available resources.
(6) Work-related expenses. In determining need, reasonable and actual work-related expenses will be deducted from earned income. These expenses include transportation at the actual costs not to exceed twenty-eight cents ($0.28) per mile,
Supp. No. 4 378
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
child care costs, work clothes and supplies. The applicant is required to provide documentation substantiating the costs and that the expenses were necessary.
(7) Travel expenses. In determining need, necessary travel which is not work-related will be budgeted if the applicant can satisfy the administrator that the prospective need for travel is necessary. For applicants in rural areas, weekly transportation to a supermarket will be considered, as will any medically necessary travel. The rate at which such necessary travel will be budgeted is twentyeight cents ($0.28) per mile, and this rate shall be construed to subsidize all costs associated with automobile ownership and operation, including gas/oil, tires, maintenance, insurance, financing, licensing/registration, excise tax, etc.
(8) Burial, cremations. The municipality recognizes its responsibility to pay for the burial or cremation of indigent persons under certain circumstances, provided that the funeral director gives timely notice to the municipality and the funeral director ascertains that there are no family members who are financially capable of paying some or all of the burial costs (22 M.R.S.A. § 4313). The maximum amount of assistance for burial/cremation services contained in this section represents the maximum municipal obligation for all costs associated with burials or cremations, including all funeral expenses.
In order for the municipality to be liable for a burial expense the funeral director must notify the administrator prior to the burial or by the end of the next business day following the funeral director's receipt of the body, whichever is earlier (22 M.R.S.A. § 4313.2). It is the funeral director's responsibility to determine if the family or any other persons are going to pay all or part of the burial expenses. If family members or others are unable to pay the expenses and the funeral director wants the municipality to pay all or part of the expenses, he/she should refer them to the municipality.
In cases where there are liable family members (father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, children, and grand-
Supp. No. 16 379
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
§ 5-68 DEXTER CODE
children) the family must apply for assistance so that the administrator can determine what resources are available to pay the costs of the burial. The municipality will not accept responsibility for the burial expenses unless all responsible family members can demonstrate to the administrator's satisfaction their inability to pay in full or make a deferred payment arrangement with the funeral home. (If there are no liable family members or others, the funeral director should apply on behalf of the deceased). The administrator may take up to ten (10) days to give a written decision. If responsible family members refuse to allow the municipality to investigate their resources the municipality will not grant assistance.
Any other benefits or resources which are available, such as the Social Security Death Benefits or contributions from other persons, will be deducted from the amount which the municipality will pay.
(9) Burial expenses. The administrator will respect the wishes of family members with regard to whether the deceased is interred by means of burial or cremated. If relatives, other persons, or other sources cannot cover the burial expenses of an indigent person, up to eight hundred fifty dollars ($850.00), the town will pay the difference, with additional payments, where there is an actual cost, for a lot in the least expensive section of the cemetery and the opening and closing of the grave site. If the municipal ordinance or cemetery bylaws require vaults or cement liners, the general assistance administrator will pay the actual wholesale price.
Allowable burial expenses are limited to removal of the body from a local residence or institution, a secured death certificate or obituary, embalming, a minimum casket and a reasonable cost for overhead. Other costs will not be paid by the town.
(10) Cremation expenses. If relatives, other persons, or other sources cannot cover the cremation expenses of an indigent person, up to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), the town will pay the difference, with additional pay-
Supp. No. 16 380
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 5 – General Assistance
GENERAL ASSISTANCE § 5-68
ments, where there is an actual cost, for a cremation lot in the least expensive section of the cemetery, a reasonable cost for a burial urn not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00), or transportation costs borne by the funeral director at a reasonable rate per mile for transporting the remains to and from the cremation facility. The administrator will respect the wishes of the family members with regard to whether the deceased is interred by means of burial or cremated. When neither the administrator nor the funeral director is able to locate any family members, the adillinistrator will issue burial assistance for cremation.
(11) Capital improvements. The costs associated with capital improvements/repairs (e.g., heating/water/septic system repair) will generally not be budgeted as a basic necessity. Exceptions can be made only when the capital improvement/ repair has been pre-approved by the administrator as a necessary expense and the monthly cost of the capital improvement/repair has been reduced as far as reasonably possible by the applicant entering into an installment payment arrangement with the contractor. The administrator may grant general assistance for capital improvements when: a. the failure to do so would place the applicant(s) in emergency circumstances; b. there are no other resources available to effect the capital repair; and c. there is no more cost-effective alternative available to the applicant or municipality to alleviate an emergency situation. In some cases, the entire immediate cost of the capital improvement can be mitigated by the applicant entering into an installment payment arrangement with a contractor. The municipality reserves the right to place a lien on any property pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A. § 4320 when general assistance has been used to effect a capital improvement. The lien process shall be accomplished in the same manner as for mortgage payments, as described above.

ing their work schedule and time off. If time off for short periods (four (4) hours or less) is necessary, it must be approved by the town manager or his/her designee. Any time off in excess of four
(4) hours must be taken as vacation or sick leave. (Ord. No. C2009-2, 2-12-09)
Sec. 9.8-5. Compensation and reimbursements.
(a) It is the objective of the Town of Dexter to offer compensa- tion that will attract and retain well qualified and responsible employees. Rates of pay are generally based on salaries and wages for towns of the same comparative size and municipal structure as Dexter. The classification of a position and specific duties and responsibilities of a position as set forth in employee job descriptions shall be major factors in determining the rate of compensation paid to individual employees.
(b) For pay purposes, employees are categorized as "exempt" (salary) and "nonexempt" (hourly wage). Salaried employees are not subject to overtime rules and are paid an established annual rate of pay based on factors such as experience, professional requirements, levels of responsibility, and education. Non- exempt, or wage employees are subject to overtime rules and special conditions, situations, and procedures that may influence the computation of pay rates. All salaries and wages are subject to annual review and adjustment based on cost of living factors, employee performance, and comparative analysis of pay rates for similar positions in other regional municipalities. Also, all em- ployees will be given an additional equivalent of a fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour increase in pay when they reach the tenth anniversary of employment, and every five (5) years thereafter. Longevity increases for salaried employees will be computed using forty (40) hours per week as the base.
(c) Entry level compensation will be determined by the town manager or in special cases, by the town council, and will be based on factors such as qualifications, experience and training. Recommendations made by individual department heads are important in establishing entry level compensation. The mini- mum entry level wage paid to a Category B or C employee will be equivalent to the current federal/state minimum wage rate plus

660
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
PERSONNEL
§ 9.8-5
one dollar eighty-five cents ($1.85) per hour. Minimum entry level wage for all other categories will be no less than current federal/ state minimum wage rates. These rates will be reviewed annually to determine if adjustments are required. Note: If the state and federal minimum wage rates differ, the highest of the two (2) will be used as the base reference.
(d) The Town of Dexter pays employees weekly. The payroll work week begins on Sunday and ends at midnight Saturday. Paychecks will generally be available no later than the following Thursday, unless other conditions warrant, with the final decision to be made by the town manager. Accounting of payroll deduc- tions, retirement contributions, and accrual of vacation and sick leave will be done through the payroll system, with each em- ployee receiving a weekly statement of earnings. Payroll checks will not be distributed to anyone other than the department head or individual employee unless a written authorization is provided and on file as part of the official employee records.
(e) It is the responsibility of each department head to complete weekly time sheets for their assigned wage employees. The completed time sheets, reflecting individual work hours, vacation, and sick leave from the previous week, will be provided to the finance officer no later than noon on Monday (Tuesday if a holiday falls on Monday). Department heads/salaried employees must complete a vacation and sick leave form which is submitted to the finance officer weekly. The form is used to track vacation and sick time use for salaried employees only.
(f) All employees and municipal officials who are not receiving a monthly flat rate amount for use of their personal vehicle when conducting official town business will be reimbursed at a rate set annually and based on comparative data. When operating per- sonal vehicles outside of town on official municipal business, those individuals receiving a monthly flat rate amount may file a claim for applicable mileage. Claims must be filed on the appro- priate reimbursement request forms which are available through the finance officer. Mileage reimbursement rates will be reviewed annually for the purpose of adjustment.

All requests for reimbursement will be reviewed by the town manager and subject to adjustment.
(h) Due to a resignation, termination or long-time illness of a department head, employees performing duties in the depart- ment head's absence, in addition to performing their own duties, shall be reimbursed at the rate of ten (10) per cent of the department head's current weekly salary plus the employee's regular weekly rate of pay.
(i) Due to a resignation, termination or long-time illness of a department head, employees performing the department head duties in the department head's absence shall be reimbursed at the rate of five (5) per cent of the department head's current weekly salary plus the employee's regular weekly rate of pay.

(b) For vacations of ten (10) working days or less, employees must have their vacation periods approved by their supervisor. For vacations of more than ten (10) working days, the employee must have the approval of both the supervisor and the town manager or his/her designee.

All vacation time will be documented on hourly wage employee time sheets or salaried employee vacation and sick leave forms.
(c) Vacation time can be accrued up to a maximum of sixty (60) days (four hundred eighty (480) hours).

(d) Upon termination of employment, any employee who has accrued vacation time up to a maximum of sixty (60) days shall be compensated for this time at his or her regular rate of pay. This will be pro-rated according to the percentage of the year which the employee has worked at the time of termination.
(e) An employee may give unused vacation time to another employee to be used as sick time at the sick employee's rate of pay with the approval of the town manager.
(f) Any person whose employment with the town is terminated for any period in excess of thirty (30) days, and who is subse- quently rehired, shall start as a new employee as far as vacation benefits are concerned.

Sick pay will be accrued according to the following schedule:
(1) Employees in Category A and B (full-time) will be eligible to accrue twelve (12) sick days per year (ninety-six (96) hours), earned at the rate of one (1) day per month.

(120) days. (Example: twenty-five (25) per cent × one hundred twenty (120) days = thirty (30) days.) A day is equivalent to the number of hours a day an employee is regularly scheduled to work. Therefore the employee will be paid for a maximum of thirty (30) days based on the assumption that one (1) sick day is equal to eight (8) hours.

(c) All employees who must be absent because of illness or injury shall report their absence within one (1) hour of their scheduled time of arrival for work to their immediate supervisor.

(d) Sick leave shall not be considered as an entitlement which an employee may use at his/her discretion, but shall be allowed for the necessity arising from actual illness, disability, require- ment to provide medical care to a family member, or the necessity to obtain medical/dental treatment. Abuse of the sick leave policy is subject to disciplinary action.
(e) Maternity and paternity leave. Employees may take up to a total of twelve (12) weeks of maternity or paternity leave.

(3) Any employee who has been informed that the medication could cause adverse side effects while working shall inform his/her supervisor prior to using these substances. The town at all times reserves the right to have a licensed physician determine if use of a prescription drug or medication by an employee produces an adverse effect. If such a finding is made, the town may notify the employee's doctor (with employee's permission) to determine if other medications are available that would not seriously affect the employee's ability to work safely. If an appropriate substitute medicine is not available, the town may limit the employee's work activities to non-safety sensitive duties.
(g) Tests required. All employees subject to this policy shall be tested for alcohol and/or controlled substances in the following circumstances:
(1) Pre-employment. Drug tests will be conducted when an offer is made to hire an employee for a CDL position. The offer for employment is contingent on the applicant pass- ing these tests. This includes existing employees who are applying for CDL positions.

The number of annual drug tests shall equal fifty (50) per cent of the number of CDL-required positions while the number of annual alco- hol tests shall equal twenty-five (25) per cent of the CDL-required positions. The town has entered into an agreement with a third party administrator (TPA) to randomly select the CDL employees for testing and then notify the program administrator of the person or persons chosen.

(4) Reasonable suspicion. All employees who exhibit to a trained supervisor signs and symptoms of alcohol and/or drug abuse while on the job, prior to reporting to work or just after work will be required to submit to an alcohol and/or drug test. The supervisor shall document the specific facts, symptoms or observations by completing a "reasonable suspicion record" form.
Note: Do not allow an employee to drive him/herself to the testing facility for a reasonable suspicion test. Instead, the supervisor or another employee should provide trans- portation to the testing facility.
(5) Return-to-duty. An employee who engaged in conduct prohibited by subsection (i) must submit to an alcohol test and drug test to return to duty. The results of an alcohol test must be less than 0.02 to return to duty.
(6) Follow-up. An employee who previously tested positive and has returned to duty must submit to a combination of at least six (6) alcohol and drug tests during the first year after returning to work. Follow-up tests will be unan- nounced and may continue for up to sixty (60) months after returning to work, not to exceed twelve (12) a year.
(h) Testing procedures.
(1) Drug testing: Drug testing is accomplished by analyzing the employee's urine specimen (urinalysis). Specimens will be collected at an off-site facility selected by the town. Once the employee provides the urine specimen, it is sealed and labeled by a certified/authorized agent of the testing facility. A chain of custody document is completed in the presence of the employee, and the specimen is shipped to a laboratory that is certified in accordance with DHS guidelines or equivalent guidelines.
a. All urinalysis procedures are required to include split-specimen techniques. Each urine sample is subdivided into two (2) containers and labeled as primary and split specimens. Both specimens are forwarded to the laboratory. Only the primary spec- imen is used in the urinalysis. In the event of a
Supp. No. 32
670.14
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
PERSONNEL
§ 9.8-19
confirmed positive, the specimen may be used for a second confirmation test if requested by the em- ployee.
b. During testing, an initial screening test is per- formed. If the test is positive for one (1) or more drugs, a confirmation test will be performed for each individual drug using gas chromatography/mass spec- trometry (GC/MS) analysis. This test ensures that over-the-counter medications are not reported as positive results. If the analysis of the primary spec- imen results in a confirmed positive test, the em- ployee may within seventy-two (72) hours request that the split specimen also be tested at a certified laboratory of his choice. The second test is at the employee's expense unless the test is negative, in which case the town will reimburse the employee.
c. All test results are reviewed by a medical review officer (MRO) prior to results being reported to the town. In the event of a positive test result, the MRO will first attempt to contact the employee and con- duct an interview to determine if there are any alternative legitimate reasons for the positive re- sults (such as over-the-counter or prescription med- ications). If the MRO determines there is a legiti- mate medical explanation for the presence of drugs, the result will be reported as negative. If the MRO is unable to contact the employee, then the employer will be contacted and requested to advise the em- ployee to contact the MRO.
d. Urine samples shall be provided in a private test room, stall or similar enclosure so that employees and applicants may not viewed while providing the sample. Employees and applicants may be required to disrobe and will be given hospital gowns to wear while providing test samples in order to ensure that there is no tampering. Street clothes, bags, brief- cases, purses and other containers may not be car- ried into the test area. The water in the commode, if any, shall be colored with dye to protect against
Supp. No. 32
670.15
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
§ 9.8-19 DEXTER CODE
dilution of test samples. An applicant or employee may waive the right to privacy and provide the urine sample in the presence of a witness (of the same gender) and not be required to disrobe and wear a hospital gown.
(2) Alcohol testing: Alcohol testing will be conducted using an evidential breath testing (EBT) device. The breath test must be performed by a certified breath alcohol techni- cian (BAT) trained in the use EBT and alcohol testing procedures. Under certain circumstances, post-accident tests conducted by law enforcement personnel or medical personnel will be acceptable. Two (2) breath tests are required to determine if an individual is over the alcohol concentration limit permitted. Any result of less than 0.02 concentration is considered a negative result. Any result of 0.02 or greater requires a conformation test. A con- firmed test of 0.02 or greater is considered a positive result.
(i) Prohibited conduct.
(1) Employees shall not:
a. Report to work and/or remain on duty with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater;
b. Possess any alcohol while on duty;
c. Use any alcohol while on duty;
d. Use any alcohol within four (4) hours before going on duty;

will not affect the safe operations of a commercial vehicle. In the case of a written warning by the physician, the employee shall report this to his/her supervisor immediately;
h. Report to or remain on duty if employee tests posi- tive for controlled substance.
(2) Failure to comply with these rules is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action and shall result in referral to a substance abuse professional.
(j) Refusal to test. An employee's failure to submit to testing may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, and is also grounds for referral to a substance abuse professional. Failure to submit to a test by an applicant will result in denial of employment. Specifically, the following circumstances may be considered a refusal to test:
(1) Failure to report to the designated testing area immedi- ately after being notified to submit to an alcohol or drug test.
(2) Failure to accurately provide a sufficient sample to be tested, either breath or urine as the case may be, unless medically determined to be unable to do so.
(3) Engaging in conduct that clearly obstructs or delays the testing process.
(k) Alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.
(1) Provided that the employee has not violated subsection (i), any employee whose alcohol test results in a concen- tration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall not be permitted to perform any safety-sensitive function for at least twenty-four (24) hours following the test.
(2) The employee will not be paid for work time lost as a result of this subsection unless he/she works in another capacity for the town during that time period. The em- ployee will not be required to undergo evaluation by a substance abuse professional if the test result is 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, nor will a return-to-duty test
Supp. No. 32
670.17
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
§ 9.8-19 DEXTER CODE
be required unless there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee is still under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Note: This subsection applies only to limited situations. For example, if an employee last consumed alcohol more than four (4) hours before work, but still has a blood/ alcohol level of .03 when he/she shows up for work, he/she is not in violation of subsection (i), but is subject to this subsection.
(l) Notice and consent. Before a drug or alcohol test is admin- istered, employees and job applicants will be asked to sign a consent form authorizing the test and permitting the release of test results to those officials with a need to know. The chemical screen consent form shall provide space to indicate current or recent use of prescription and over-the-counter medication. All recruitment announcements for any CDL position, including in-house recruitment and promotion, will disclose that a drug screening test will be required of the applicant.
(m) Consequences of violation of this policy.
(1) Any employee who violates this policy shall be immedi- ately removed from the safety-sensitive function and will be advised by the town of the resources available for evaluating and resolving drug and alcohol abuse prob- lems. The employee is required to be evaluated by a substance abuse professional. All evaluation and rehabil- itation shall be at the employee's cost unless otherwise agreed by the town. An employee shall not be allowed to return to the safety-sensitive function until he/she has a return-to-duty alcohol test result of less that 0.02 or a return-to-duty drug test with a verified negative result.
(2) In addition, any employee who violates this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dis- missal. Before discipline, reassignment or dismissal is imposed following a confirmed positive drug test, the employee shall have the opportunity to participate for up to six (6) months in a rehabilitation program. The em- ployee is responsible for all costs associated with the rehabilitation program unless otherwise agreed by the

b. Failure within six (6) months to successfully com- plete a rehabilitation program after commencing the program, or failure to pass a return-to-duty drug or alcohol test.
c. Evidence that the employee has substituted, adul- terated, diluted or otherwise tampered with his/her urine sample.
d. Failure to contact a substance abuse professional within (5) regular working days after being notified of a confirmed (MRO-certified) positive test for the improper use of alcohol or unauthorized substances.
(4) During the period the town is awaiting an employee's test result for a post-accident test, reasonable suspicion test, or return-to-duty test, the town may transfer the em- ployee to another position with or without reduction in pay or benefits. The town also reserves the right to place an employee on unpaid suspension to reduce any possible safety hazard. A determination as to whether an em- ployee is placed in another position or placed on paid or unpaid suspension may be based on, but is not limited to: who is responsible for and/or the severity of the accident if applicable; the observed condition of the employee, if applicable; the employee's work history; length of employ- ment; current job performance and the existence of past

(2) Any employee with a positive test result may, upon written request to the program administrator, have the right to any information relating to the test result and procedures. A job applicant may request information concerning the test result within sixty (60) days after the decision on his/her employment application.
(3) Upon successfully completing a rehabilitation program within six (6) months after it commences and upon passing a return-to-duty drug test, the employee is enti- tled to return to his/her previous job with full pay (but not back pay) and accrued benefits, unless conditions unre- lated to the employee's previous test make the employee's return impossible or inappropriate. The rehabilitation or treatment provider in consultation with the program administrator shall determine whether the employee has successfully completed the rehabilitation program. The town is not required to hold the employee's job open for more than six (6) months after the employee commences a rehabilitation program. The employee may apply accrued vacation and sick leave, if any, against the time period where he or she is unavailable for work due to drug abuse rehabilitation.

be released to any person other than to the employee or the applicant who is tested, the program administrator, officials with a need to know, and the rehabilitation provider. The foregoing shall not prevent the release of information that is required or permitted by state or federal law, or the use of information in a grievance procedure, administrative hearing or lawsuit relating to the imposition of the test or the use of the test results.
(p) Documents provided. The town will provide each person subject to this policy a copy of the policy. The town will also provide printed material which describes the effects of alcohol and/or controlled substances on the individual's health, work and personal life, as well as the information of the signs and symp- toms of alcohol or controlled substances and methods of treat- ment or intervention for drug or alcohol abuse.

Sec. 9.8-20. Sexual harassment and unlawful discrimina- tion policy.
(a) The Town of Dexter is an equal opportunity employer with an employee tradition of dedication, high performance, personal development, and professional demeanor. It is expected that every town employee will treat every other town employee with respect, courtesy, supportiveness and professionalism. It is also expected that no town employee will interfere with any other town employee's ability to work. This includes, but is not limited to, sexual harassment, physical abuse and verbal abuse, which includes making professionally damaging statements about oth- ers. Failure to meet this expectation is grounds for suspension or dismissal. Ordinarily issues of this kind are dealt with through the regular supervisory relationship. Where that is not feasible, every town employee has recourse to the next higher supervisor and or the individual, who is the designated sexual harassment representative.
(b) Sexual harassment is a violation of laws against discrimi- nation (State of Maine Law, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances; suggestive or lewd remarks; unwanted hugs, touches,

(1) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employ- ment; or
(2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individ- ual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
(3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
(c) No employee will be subject to any form of retaliation or discipline for pursuing in good faith a harassment or discrimina- tion complaint or for participating in the investigation of any such complaint.
(Ord. No. C2009-2, 2-12-09)
Sec. 9.8-21. Termination for cause.
(a) Employees (Categories A, B and C) shall not be terminated without adequate warning and/or sufficient cause. The town manager shall be notified and must concur with the action, prior to termination of any employee. All adverse personnel actions leading to employee termination shall be communicated to the employee in a timely manner and shall not be allowed to accu- mulate without his/her knowledge.
(b) The town manager shall hold a pre-termination meeting with an employee prior to any decision to terminate employment. The town manager shall discuss with the employee the work performance or conduct that may be grounds for termination.
(c) Notice of any action against an employee must be in writing and filed with the employee not later than the effective date of such action. The notice shall specify the penalty and contain a statement of the reason or reasons for the action.

(Ord. No. C2009-2, 2-12-09)
Sec. 9.8-22. Grievance procedure.
(a) A grievance is defined as any dispute between an employee and his/her supervisor (or anyone else in management) which concerns the claim of breach or violation of work rules; or the interpretation, effect, or application of work rules. Work rules are established herein and/or by state and federal statutes. Every effort shall be made to settle any such dispute to the satisfaction of all concerned at the earliest possible time.
(b) The following steps shall be followed in the grievance resolutions process:
(1) The grieving party shall attempt to reach a verbal agree- ment with his/her supervisor or the appropriate depart- ment head.
(2) If a verbal agreement cannot be attained, the grieving party may file a written complaint within five (5) working days to the appropriate department head. The depart- ment head shall review the complaint and render a decision and written response within three (3) working days.
(3) If the department head's decision is not satisfactory to the grievant; the grievant may request the town clerk within five (5) working days that a personnel advisory board be convened to consider the case. The personnel advisory board shall meet within ten (10) working days after the request of the grievant is received. The personnel advi- sory board, after review of all the facts, will make a recommendation to the town manager for a final decision on the matter within five (5) working days.

The personnel advi- sory board shall meet within ten (10) working days after the request of the grievant is received. The recommenda- tion of the personnel advisory board will be binding.
(6) Finally, if the grieving party remains dissatisfied, he/she may appeal through the court system, at his/her own expense, beginning with superior court.
(c) Any party may be represented by counsel or the person of their choice. In the event the employee waives the right to be represented, the town may waive its right to be represented. All proceedings will be conducted so as to respect the privacy of the individuals involved. While technical rules of evidence shall not apply, testimony and evidence shall be limited to the grievance at issue.

Sec. 9.8-23. Promotion and procedures.
(a) The Town of Dexter is an equal opportunity employer and pursues a policy of nondiscrimination in its personnel practices.

(b) First preference in filling any vacancy shall be given to the promotion or transfer of present employees having the qualifica- tions for the vacant position. However, it is recognized that in order to meet specific requirements for a position, it may be necessary to hire from outside the organization. Such a decision shall only be made after a careful review of the qualifications and/or training requirements of present town employees who indicate an interest in the position.
(c) Following review of possible candidates to fill the position from within the organization, public notice must be given relating to the availability of a vacant position. Notice must include at least one (1) advertisement in a local/regional newspaper. Ade- quate time to respond to employment notices shall be provided to applicants.
(d) Department heads are authorized to initiate the hiring process of new employees under their supervision by notifying the town manager. The department head will then advertise, inter- view, hire and notify the town manager and the finance officer. Department heads are discouraged from hiring immediate rela- tives. Department heads will be hired by the interview manage- ment team consisting of the town manager, assistant town manager, finance officer and the existing department head, if available, subject to the approval of the town council. The town manager and town assessor will be hired exclusively at the discretion of the town council. Assuming an adequate number of suitable applicants respond to the job vacancy announcement, at least three (3) candidates may be interviewed by the respective department head/town manager/town council/interview manage- ment team prior to final selection of the new employee.
(e) All prospective employees must submit a completed appli- cation for employment or an acceptable substitute, e.g., a resume and accompanying background and reference information. Note: Seasonal and temporary employees must re-apply each year or job cycle for positions.

(f) As a general rule, in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety, the town shall refrain from employing immediate relatives in the same department. Any departure from this general policy must be thoroughly justified, and approved by the town manager. For purposes of definition, an immediate relative shall include any of the following: Spouse, parents, siblings, children (to include step-children) and in-laws.
(g) All new employees (Category A, B and C) will be on a probationary status for the first ninety (90) days of employment. The probationary period shall be considered an extension of the selection process. Probationary employees may be removed at any time during the probationary period without cause and without right to file a grievance.
(h) All new employees (Categories A, B and C) will be provided a confirmation of employment letter which outlines the basic conditions of employment, including starting wage/salary, proba- tionary details and explanation of benefits.

(Ord. No. C2009-2, 2-12-09)
Sec. 9.8-25. Electronic mail policy.
(a) Purpose. Electronic mail, internet and telecommunication access are resources made available to town employees to com- municate with each other, other governmental entities, compa- nies and individuals for the benefit of the town. Personal use of these communication systems is limited to personal, off-duty time.
(b) Electronic mail policy.
(1) The Town of Dexter electronic mail system (e-mail) is designed to facilitate town business communications among employees and other business associates for messages or memoranda. Since no computer system is completely secure, the e-mail system is not intended to transmit sensitive materials, such as personnel decisions and other similar information which may be more appropriately communicated by written memorandum or personal con- versation.
(2) The e-mail system is town property and intended for town business. The system is not to be used for employee personal gain or to support or advocate for non-town- related business or purposes. All data and other electronic messages within the system are the property of the Town of Dexter. E-mail messages have been found to be public records and may be subject to the right-to-know laws, depending on their content.
Supp. No. 33
670.27
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
§ 9.8-25 DEXTER CODE
(3) In addition, the town, through its manager and supervi- sors, reserves the right to review the contents of employ- ee's e-mail communications. Employees have no right to privacy with respect to any e-mail communications.
(4) The Town of Dexter, through its town manager, pur- chases, owns and administers the necessary software and licenses to provide access to e-mail and internet services. Employees may not rent, copy or loan the software or its documentation. The town has invested much time and money to secure its electronic systems from intrusion and harmful viruses. Therefore employees may not provide or download any software program not approved by the town. Employees may be held responsible for any dam- ages caused by using unauthorized software or viruses they introduce into the town system.
a. General information on passwords. While users may have a confidential password, users should be aware that this does not mean that the system is for personal, confidential communication, nor does it suggest that e-mail is the property right of the employee. The use of the e-mail system is for town business.
b. Prohibited uses. When sending e-mail messages, appropriateness and good judgment should be used. The following e-mail uses are prohibited, including, but not limited to:
1. Communications that in any way may be con- strued by others as disruptive, offensive, abu- sive or threatening;
2. Communications of sexually explicit images or messages;
3. Communications that contain ethnic slurs, ra- cial epithets, or anything that may be con- strued as harassment or disparagement of oth- ers based on race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability or religious beliefs;
4. Solicitation for commercial ventures, religious or political causes, outside organizations, or other nonjob related solicitations; and
Supp. No. 33
670.28
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
PERSONNEL
§ 9.8-25
5. Any other use that may compromise the integ- rity of the town and its business in any way.
c. Retention of e-mail.
1. Generally, e-mail messages are intended to be temporary communications that are nonvital and may be discarded routinely. However, de- pending on the content of the e-mail message, it may be considered a more formal record and should be retained pursuant to a department's record retention schedules. As such, these e- mail messages are similar to print communica- tion and should be written with the same care.
2. Employees should be aware that when they have deleted a message from their workstation mailbox it might not have been deleted from the central e-mail system. The message may be residing in the recipient's mailbox or forwarded to other recipients. Furthermore, the message may be stored on the computer's back-up sys- tem for an indefinite period. Note that e-mail has been classified as "public" documents, i.e., available to the media, in at least one (1) state. Keep that in mind when you create or store e-mail.
3. Employees should delete e-mail messages that are not deemed to be a formal record as soon as possible after reading. An accumulation of files will degrade system performance and response times. Contact the town manager if you are unsure as to whether to retain messages.
4. This e-mail policy applies to all employees, contractors, part-time employees, volunteers, and other individuals who are provided access to the town's e-mail system. Third parties should only be provided access to the e-mail system as necessary for their business purpose with the town and only if they abide by all applicable rules.

Town of Dexter, Maine Section 9.8 – Personnel
§ 9.8-25 DEXTER CODE
d. Effect of employee separation on e-mail access. Em- ployees who leave employment with the town have no right to the contents of their e-mail messages and are not allowed access to the e-mail system.
(c) Internet policy.
(1) The internet provides the town with significant access and dissemination of information to individuals outside of the town. The use of the internet system for access and dissemination of information is intended to serve town business. Like all e-mail messages, internet messages are capable of being forwarded without the express permis- sion of the original author. E-mail messages are also routinely passed through routers before they reach their final destination. A message is "touched" many times before it gets to its recipient, and the message author should be aware of this. Therefore, users must use cau- tion in the transmission and dissemination of messages outside of the town, and must comply with all state and federal laws.
(2) Just as employees have no right of privacy with respect to the content of their e-mail communications, employees do not have any right of privacy with respect to their internet use. The town reserves the right to review or monitor all employees' internet use, including sites viewed and viewing time.
(3) The viewing of pornographic or sexually oriented sites is strictly prohibited.
(d) Penalties. The misuse of the internet or e-mail privileges may be considered sufficient cause for discipline in accordance with the personnel policy and/or other applicable rules or laws. In addition, violations of this policy or misuse of the e-mail system may be referred for criminal prosecution.

(e) Agreement to internet and electronic mail policy. The town will require employees to read and signify acceptance of the terms of this policy by signing the following agreement before making electronic systems available:
I have read and agree to the specifics as stated in the attached Internet and Electronic Mail Policy, which include the following:
1. Use of the Internet and e-mail systems is intended for the furthering of the business of this municipality.
2. I may not intentionally intercept, eavesdrop, record, read, alter, or receive other persons' e-mail messages without proper authorization.
3. I may not use the e-mail system for solicitation of funds, political messages, obscene or harassing messages, or other messages which violate the Policy.
4. The Internet and E-mail systems are the property of the Town of Dexter and may be accessed for review and monitoring by supervisors and Town Manager.

The town fully supports the concept of recycling. Recycling is a wise and prudent solid waste management technique that reduces pollution and environmental degradation; keeps usable manufacturing material in the economy; saves energy; saves tipping fees; and signifies a sense of the importance of effective waste management procedures.

Sec. 11-1. Types of roads.
(a) Town way. Town ways are roads or streets generally created by some action of the municipality, such as dedication and acceptance, purchase and acceptance, eminent domain, or pre- scriptive use. Some town ways came into existence when state law transferred the ownership and responsibility for maintaining county roads to the town, but applies to only those county roads that had not been abandoned or discontinued before July 29, 1976. Town ways may also be created when the state reclassifies a road and turns it over to the town. A municipality must keep

town ways "in repair so as to be safe and convenient for travelers with motor vehicles" (23 M.R.S.A. Sec. 3651) and keep such ways passable if they become "blocked or encumbered with snow" (23
M.R.S.A. § 3201).
(b) Public easement road or street. A public easement road differs from a town way in that while the general public has a right of unobstructed access by motor vehicle or foot over a public easement road, the municipality is not obligated to maintain or repair the road. The town council may authorize the repair and maintenance of public easement roads, but is not required to do so (23 M.R.S.A. § 3105). When the town council does elect to maintain a public easement road, it is not required to do so to the same degree that it maintains a town way. The town is not liable for defects in or lack of repair to public easement roads (23
M.R.S.A. §§ 3651, 3655).
(c) Private roads. A privately owned road, commonly called a "private road", is a road over which neither the municipality, nor the general public has the right to pass by vehicle or on foot. In general, the town has no legal right to spend public funds to repair, maintain, or plow privately owned roads. In emergency cases, such as a house fire in winter, it is legal to send a snowplow down a privately owned road so that an emergency vehicle can get in, but the owner is responsible for ensuring that the road is sufficiently maintained to allow the plow to get through.
(d) Status-quo roads. This classification of municipal road was locally adopted in 1982; however, it is no longer used by the town. Roads in this classification were considered officially "discontin- ued", however, a limited amount of maintenance and upkeep was performed by the town. Town roads that were previously classi- fied as "status-quo" have either been fully discontinued or ac- cepted as public easement roads (see subsection (b) of this section).
(e) State and state-aid roads. These are roads owned by the state, however, different levels of maintenance are performed on the roads based on classification. Generally speaking, mainte- nance (culverts, construction, paving, etc) on this class of road is

performed by the state department of transportation (DOT). However, the town may have responsibility to remove snow from portions of state and state-aid roads. Individuals should contact the town office or public works department for information concerning the agency responsible for snow removal on a particular state road within the town.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-2. Creation of town streets and roads.
(a) Dedication and acceptance. By state statute, dedication and acceptance is a two-step process. First, the landowner/a must file with the town council a "petition, agreement, deed, affidavit or other writing" (23 M.R.S.A. § 3025) describing the property that the owner/s intends to dedicate (give) to the town for the purpose of creating a public road, and stating that the owner/s waives any claim for damages. Dedication may also be accomplished by the sale of lots with reference to an approved subdivision plan, that has been recorded at the registry of deeds, and shows or describes the property as a road. Second, the town council must vote to accept the dedication. Upon acceptance of the dedication the council will acquire a fee simple interest in the property unless the dedication document or acceptance order states otherwise. The acceptance order adopted by the council will state whether the road is accepted as a town way or as a public easement. In order to be accepted as a town way, a road or street must meet the road standards specified in section 11- 41. However, even if a road is built to or beyond ordinance standards, the municipality has no legal obligation to accept it as a public easement or town way. When a road is presented to the town for acceptance as a town way, any initial costs for determining if the presented road meets town standards for acceptance shall be borne by the town. If additional inspections are requested by the party seeking acceptance, all costs for such inspection shall be the responsibility of that party. A road may not be accepted on a conditional basis, such as the occurrence of some future event or alteration of the existing road. The dedication and acceptance process will generally require the conduct of a public hearing and the publishing of required notice.
Supp. No. 23 727
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
§ 11-2 DEXTER CODE
(b) Purchase and acceptance. The town may obtain property for road purposes by purchase and acceptance. This differs from a dedication in that the landowner is paid for the property.
(c) Eminent domain. Eminent domain, also called "laying out and acceptance" or "condemnation", is a process which allows the town to purchase private land for public use, even if the landowner objects. Eminent domain can be used to create either a town way or a public easement road or street. Damages in an eminent domain proceeding are determined in accordance with 23 M.R.S.A. § 3029 and 23 M.R.S.A. § 154. Damages to which the landowner is entitled may include the fair market value of the land, as well as "severance damages". Severance damage is the reduction in value to the remaining land as a result of the taking. A party may appeal an eminent domain proceeding to superior court.
(d) Prescriptive use. A public road can be created by long-term public use, without any formal acceptance or taking by the municipality. A road created in this manner is called a "prescriptive easement", but should not be confused with the term "public easement". Depending upon the type of use that has been made of the road, a road created by prescriptive use can be a town way or a public easement road. A prescriptive use easement will not arise where the use is with the landowner's permission or agreement. Sporadic, minor repairs financed by the town are not enough to create a town way or public easement road or street. The fact that a town way is created by prescription rather than by a formal method does not reduce the town's maintenance obligation.
(e) Acceptance of previously discontinued or abandoned roads. Any road that was previously discontinued or abandoned by the town must meet the road standards outlined in this article prior to being considered for acceptance as a town way or public easement road (see subsection (a) of this section).

Supp. No. 23 728
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
STREETS AND ROADS § 11-3
Sec. 11-3. Disposing of town roads and streets.
(a) Discontinuance. Discontinuance is a formal procedure established by Maine state law for the purpose of terminating the town way status of roads or streets, in whole or in part (23
M.R.S.A. § 3026).
(1) Procedure. The following procedures will be used when seeking permanent discontinuance of a town way:
a. The town council must determine whose property abuts the road in question and the amount of damages that should be paid, if any.
b. The town council will provide "best practicable notice" of the proposed discontinuance to all abutting property owners and to the planning board. The notice will indicate the road (or portion of road) proposed for discontinuance, and the date, time and place of the meeting at which the council will discuss the matter.
c. The town council will meet to determine whether or not to order the discontinuance. This should be done at the meeting indicated in the notice sent to the abutters. This can be done at a regular meeting of the town council or can be done at a special meeting. In either case, the meeting is a "public meeting" subject to notice. If it is decided to proceed with discontinuance, an "order of discontinuance" should be prepared and signed.
d. The "order of discontinuance" signed by the town council must then be filed with the town clerk and a "notice of discontinuance" should be mailed to the abutting property owners along with a copy of the "order of discontinuance".
e. Following delivery of the formal "order of discontinuance" with abutting property owners, the town council must take final action on the discontinuance and damage awards, if any. Until this step is taken, the discontinuance action is incomplete. If the council rejects the order, the discontinuance fails.
Supp. No. 23 728.1
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
§ 11-3 DEXTER CODE
f. If the discontinuance action is approved, the town clerk will record an attested "certificate of road discontinuance" at the registry of deeds.
(2) Appeal of discontinuance. Any person aggrieved by the town's decision discontinue (or by its failure to do so) may appeal to the superior court within thirty (30) days of the decision. Any person aggrieved by the town's measure of damages may appeal to the superior court within sixty
(60) days after the town council approves the "order of discontinuance".
(3) Legal status of discontinued roads and streets. Depending upon when a road was discontinued and the language of the discontinuance order or article, the town may retain a public easement over a discontinued road or a portion of the road. A discontinuance which occurred before September 3, 1965 and failed to specify that an easement was being retained resulted in no public easement and ownership of the way reverted to the abutting land owners. By contrast, a discontinuance occurring on or after September 3, 1965 terminates the town's maintenance obligation, but leaves a public easement automatically, unless the article or order authorizing the discontinuance specifically rejected retention of a public easement. The municipality has the option, but not the obligation to maintain such an easement.
(b) Statutory abandonment. If a town way has not been kept passable for motor vehicles or maintained to any significant extent at public expense for a period of thirty (30) or more consecutive years, it may be presumed abandoned. After determining that a road meets the criteria of statutory abandonment, the town council shall hold a public hearing and act on an order of "determination of presumption of abandonment". If approved by a majority vote of the town council, the order should be filed with the registry of deeds. Once a road is formally declared abandoned, it is relegated to the same status as it would if it had been discontinued. If the abandonment occurred on or after September 3, 1965, a public easement remains unless otherwise noted in the abandonment order.

Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
STREETS AND ROADS § 11-4
Sec. 11-4. Road closings and weight restrictions.
(a) Closing roads to winter maintenance. The town council may designate that certain roads or portions of roads be closed to winter maintenance. The term of closure for winter maintenance can range from one (1) to ten (10) years. Under this procedure, maintenance of selected roads (including town ways public easement roads) can be discontinued for specific months spanning the period November to April. Action by the town council to close selected roads to winter maintenance must be taken between May 1 and October 1. The procedure for closing roads for winter maintenance is as follows:
(1) Selection of road(s). The town council, or upon petition by at least seven (7) voters, draw up a list of proposed roads for closure. Determination of whether or not to close a road to winter maintenance is generally based on population and use during the winter months.
(2) Public hearing. The town council will schedule a public hearing to discuss the proposed winter closures. Notice of public hearing must be placed in some conspicuous public place at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing.
(3) Order for closure. Following the public hearing the council will file with the town clerk an order specifying the road(s) (or portions thereof) to be closed to winter maintenance. The order must specify the months of nonmaintenance and the number of years the closing order will be in effect. A winter closing can span a period of one
(1) to ten (10) years; however, if the order fails to specify, the length of closing is one (l)year.
(4) Order approval. Once the order is completed and filed with the town clerk, the town council must act on each order.
(b) Temporary closings and weight restrictions. Many roads are vulnerable to damage during certain times of the year. This provision allows the town council to authorize the road commissioner to close a road to all traffic, or to impose both temporary and permanent restrictions on the gross weight, speed, and operation of vehicles on town roads and bridges depending on the
Supp. No. 26 728.3
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
§ 11-4 DEXTER CODE
circumstances. Road weight restrictions generally do not apply to the operation of emergency vehicles, fuel deliveries, and utility trucks. In some cases, the town manager or public works director may authorize the issue of a permit for certain vehicles to operate on weight restricted town roads. Violation of a posting or permit is a traffic infraction punishable by a mandatory minimum fine of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) (29-A M.R.S.A. § 2395). All funds collected from such fines are retained by the town.
(1) Closings for emergencies. A police officer, on-scene commander of a fire fighting operation, director of public works, or the local emergency management director may initiate the emergency closure of a town road. The town manager and/or town council may also direct the closure of a town road or street for emergency purposes.
(2) Closing for special activities and events. The town council is the sole approving authority for temporary closure of streets, roads, and municipal parking areas. Requests by citizens and organizations will be submitted in writing to the town council. The requests will be acted upon during a regularly scheduled meeting of the council.
(3) A permit is required to operate a vehicle in excess of thirty-two thousand (32,000) pounds on the following roads: Owlsboro Road, Eaton Road, and Charleston Road Extension.

DIVISION 2. ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
Sec. 11-9. Obligation to maintain and repair roads.
The director of public works is charged with the responsibility to oversee all programs associated with the maintenance and repair of town ways and public easement roads. In this capacity he will also develop and maintain a long range plan of the maintenance and paving of the town's roads. He will also main-

STREETS AND ROADS § 11-11
tain a current inventory of all town ways and public easement roads as well as historical information on all active and discontinued roads and streets.
(1) Town ways. State law requires that town ways be kept open and in repair so as to be "safe and convenient" for travelers with motor vehicles (23 M.R.S.A. § 3651). Additionally, the town is required to remove snow from town ways and make them passable in a reasonable amount of time. Private individuals have no right to repair or reconstruct town ways. Such repairs may only be done by the town public works department, department of transportation, or their designated contractor.
(2) Public easements. The town has broad discretion in deciding how to care for and maintain public easement roads and streets. The municipality is not obligated to maintain or repair a public easement road. Also, when the town actively maintains a public easement road it is not obligated to perform the level of maintenance required on a town way. The town is not liable for defects in or lack of repair to public easement roads (23 M.R.S.A. §§ 3651, 3655), but may be liable for injuries caused by negligent acts or omissions in its ownership, maintenance or use of vehicles or machinery and equipment on such roads.
(3) Privately owned road s. Public funds or equipment may not be used to maintain privately owned roads.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-10. Road maintenance, reconstruction, and paving.
The town conducts a seasonal road maintenance program which includes road repairs, major reconstruction projects, paving, ditching, culvert work, roadside brush cutting and tree removal, sidewalk and bridge maintenance, and sign replacement.

(a) Town ways. The town is required to keep town ways passable if they become "blocked or encumbered with snow" (23
M.R.S.A. § 3201). Every attempt will be made by the town public

Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
§ 11-11 DEXTER CODE
works department to remove snow and ice from town ways in an expeditious manner. Generally speaking, the more heavily traveled roads will be cleared first.
(b) Public easement roads. The level of snow removal and winter maintenance on public easement roads will be determined by the town council. The town manager and public works director will annually conduct a review of all public easement roads to determine if the current level of winter maintenance should be changed. Maintenance of a road can be discontinued for a specific number of months from November to April, inclusive. Any recommended changes will be presented to the town council for review and action.
(c) Privately owned roads. Removal of snow from privately owned roads will generally not be performed with town equipment. There may be unique situations which could necessitate the use of town equipment, such as providing access for vehicles in the event of an emergency.
(d) Sidewalks. The obligation to remove snow from town ways also requires the removal of snow and ice from sidewalks; however, as a matter of prioritizing the use of personnel and resources the town will generally remove snow from sidewalks adjacent to town ways only after roads have been cleared and are safe for travel by motorists. The town is not liable for injuries caused by snow or ice or slippery conditions on sidewalks (23
M.R.S.A. § 3658).
(e) Public access to town sand. Residents are allowed limited access to the town road-sand stockpile. Quantities are limited to a maximum of two (2) hand-held buckets per person on any single visit to the site. Commercial use of sand from the town stockpile is absolutely prohibited. Individuals violating this policy will lose privileges to use this resource for a minimum of one (1) year. (Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-12. Culverts and driveways.
(a) Culverts. This section applies primarily to the installation and maintenance of culverts that underlie private driveways along town ways. Situations differ on public easement roads
Supp. No. 26 728.6
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
STREETS AND ROADS § 11-12
(depending on the level of maintenance determined by the town council) and on state/state-aid roads (a permit is required from the DOT). When a property owner abutting a town way wishes to install a driveway and/or culvert, the property owner must first acquire a permit and have a representative of the town public works department inspect the site (information pertaining to permits is provided in section 11-28). The size and type of all culverts installed on any town street or road must be approved by the public works director. The property owner is generally responsible for the purchase of the first culvert. The town is responsible for the culvert's installation as well as all follow-on maintenance and subsequent culvert purchase and installation. The town will provide for the purchase of the first culvert and subsequent replacement if the culvert is solely for the benefit of the road, and does not provide access to an abutter's property. To ensure proper drainage, culverts installed on collector roads (a road or street servicing at least fifteen [15] lots or dwelling units, or serving as a feeder to a major thoroughfare) must be a minimum of eighteen
(18) inches in diameter, and culverts installed on all other streets and roads must be a minimum of fifteen (15) inches in diameter. If conditions dictate the culvert minimum size may be waived by the road commissioner on a case-by-case basis.
(b) Driveways. A person seeking to construct a new driveway or change an existing driveway location, grade or kind of use within the right-of-way of a town maintained road must acquire a permit from the town (see section 11-28). The town road commissioner is the approval authority for driveway permits. Factors such as line-of-sight, use, safety, and drainage will be considered in the evaluation of application for a driveway permit. A permit must be obtained from the state department of transportation (MDOT) if the driveway construction is planned to access a state/state-aid road.
(c) Permit fees. Persons seeking permits for the installation of culverts along town right-of-ways or construction of driveways that access town ways must pay a non-refundable fee of twentyfive dollars ($25.00).

§ 11-13 DEXTER CODE
Sec. 11-13. Ditches and drains.
Improper drainage is the leading cause of road deterioration. Ditches and drains are therefore critical aspects of road maintenance. The town has a legal duty to maintain and keep in repair the drains, culverts, and ditches it has established, regardless whether they are located on public or private property. No persons shall willfully cultivate plants, operate farm machinery, or deposit fill within municipal ditches, drains, or culverts. Persons interfering with the town's ditches, drains, and culverts are subject to a fine as specified in 23 M.R.S.A. § 3252, and 30A
M.R.S.A. §§ 3401-3409.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-14. Brush and tree removal.
The town's obligation to keep town ways "safe and convenient" (23 M.R.S.A. § 3651), includes the duty to remove roadside brush, trees, and grass that could pose a road safety problem. The town may, at its expense, remove healthy or dead trees located within the right-of-way if they pose a safety hazard to the traveling public, or impede the town's ability to maintain the road. Ifa tree is located in the right-of-way, but is not a safety hazard (in the determination of the public works director/road commissioner), then the town is under no obligation to remove it, even if the abutter requests that the tree be removed. If the reason for removing the tree is to protect an abutter's house or property, rather than the traveling public, then the abutter shall pay the costs of removal. Trees located outside the road right-of-way will generally not be removed by the town; however, the town may cut any limbs in the air or roots on the ground which intrude into the right-of-way, even if the tree trunk is outside of the right-of-way. (Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-15. Sidewalks and bridges.
(a) Sidewalks. The town must maintain sidewalks existing within the right-of-way of a town way, and is responsible for injuries caused by defects in the sidewalk. However, municipalities are not liable for injuries caused by snow or ice or slippery conditions on sidewalks (23 M.R.S.A. § 3658). The town is not

responsible for the maintenance of sidewalks on public easement streets and roads, and may not maintain sidewalks along privately owned roads.
(b) Bridges. Bridges in the town are maintained by either the town or the MDOT. State laws pertaining to bridges are found in 23 M.R.S.A. §§ 351-610-J. Generally, the party responsible for a particular bridge is the party responsible for the adjoining

DIVISION 3. CONTROL OF ROADS
Sec. 11-25. Traffic and parking.
30-A M.R.S.A. § 3009 and Chapter 9, section 9-26 of this Code provides exclusive authority to municipal officers to enact ordinances regulating traffic and parking on municipal streets and roads. The town council also performs the function of the town traffic control board. Traffic regulation includes the authority to erect yield signs, stop signs and other traffic control devices; to designate ways and portions of ways as being closed to traffic, and to designate one-way streets. It also includes control of pedestrian traffic on public ways, establishment of cross walks, creation of "handicapped parking" spaces, establishment of parking restrictions and designation of "no-parking" areas.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-26. Speed limits.
Beginning in 2001, municipalities were empowered with the authority to set speed limits on roads under their jurisdiction within certain guidelines (29-A M.R.S.A. § 2075(3)). The town's
Supp. No. 23 728.9

traffic control board has exclusive authority to designate speed limits on town ways and public easement roads. See Chapter 9 (Motor Vehicles and Traffic) of this Code for details.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-27. Road boundaries.
One of the more common difficulties related to municipal roads is defining the legal boundaries of town ways and public easement roads. Most roads are wider than the traveled portion of the road, and include a non-traveled portion of the right-of-way. For example, a three-rod road is forty-nine and five-tenths (49.5) feet wide, but often only twenty-five (25) through thirty (30) feet is paved or graded for the passage of vehicles. When a road's boundaries cannot be clearly determined, the municipal officers may treat it as a three-rod road which is measured from the center of the traveled way (one and one-half (11'2) rods on each side of the road's centerline).
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-28. Permits required.
(a) Road opening permit. A road opening permit shall be obtained from the director of public works/road commissioner before excavation work is done on any town way or public easement road. The latest date of opening will be October 15 unless a special permit is issued on a day-to-day basis. The person completing the permit (permittee) shall be liable for the acts of his/her agent and/or contractor for any damage done to both public and private property located above or below ground. A bond may be required in some cases. The town manager will determine whether or not a bond is required, and in what amount. The permittee is responsible for performing the following:
(1) Provide proper barricading and lighting of the site so that all traffic, vehicular, pedestrian or other shall be adequately protected.
(2) Insure the site is backfilled completely with gravel (except for the minimum amount of material necessary to immediately protect an underground pipe or conduit from damage) and completely remove material from roadway

(b) Driveway and culvert permit. A person seeking to construct a new driveway, install a new culvert, or change an existing driveway location, grade, or kind of use within the right-of-way of a town maintained road must acquire a permit from the public works department. A representative of the public works department will visit the site prior to issue of the permit. In the case of culvert installations, the permit will specify the minimum diameter culvert to be used in the construction.
(c) Failure to obtain a permit. Performing work within the town right-of-way without obtaining the required permit may be subject to a fine up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day that the violation exists. All funds derived from such fines will be retained by the town.

Sec. 11-29. Obstructions.
The town may be liable for injuries caused by obstructions on town ways. Therefore, the person responsible for creating the obstruction will insure its immediate removal. In the event the person responsible for creating the obstruction fails to remove it in a timely manner, the public works director/road commissioner or municipal officers have the authority to remove said obstruction and seek to recover the expense of removal from the responsible party. The following addresses the authority to remove obstructions on public roads:
(1) Criminal offense. It is a criminal offense (a Class E crime, up to six months imprisonment and a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)) to obstruct a public way after having been ordered by a law enforcement officer to remove the obstruction (17A M.R.S.A. § 505).

(2) Water flow. It is a civil violation (punishable by a fine of up to $50 and costs for the first offense and up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) and costs for the second) to obstruct the flow of water in ditches or drains along the public way (23 M.R.S.A. §§ 3252, 3253). Interference with ditches, drains or culverts that are under municipal control is punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) and three (3) months imprisonment (23
M.R.S.A. § 3251).
(3) Snow and slush. The placing of snow, ice, or slush in a public way that has not accumulated naturally constitutes illegal obstruction. Such action is subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per incident (29-A M.R.S.A.

(c) Administration. The process of naming town roads is administered by the municipal addressing officer. The municipal addressing officer shall maintain all official records relating to road naming, and maintain an official map which depicts road names and numbers. The municipal addressing officer is authorized to and shall assign road names and numbers to all properties, both on existing as well as proposed roads, in accordance with the following criteria:
(1) Numbering system. A record of assigned street numbers will be maintained by the municipal addressing officer.
Supp. No. 28 728.12
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
STREETS AND ROADS § 11-30
Whenever any residence or other structure is constructed or developed, it shall be the duty of the new owner to obtain an assigned number from the town. This shall be done at the time of issuance of either a building permit or an electrical installation form. Additionally, any prospective sub-divider shall show a proposed road name and lot numbering system on the preliminary plan submission to the town planning board. Approval by the planning board, after consultation with the municipal addressing officer, shall constitute the assignment of road names and numbers to the lots in the subdivision.
(2) Official road names. The process required for the naming of roads applies to both public and private roads. A current master index for all town roads will be maintained by the municipal addressing officer. Names assigned by the municipal addressing officer may be changed by action of the town council. In the event an individual or group wishes to change the name of a road, they must first submit a written request to the municipal addressing officer. The request will be presented to the town council who must hold a public hearing prior to taking action on the requested road name change. No two (2) roads shall be given the same name (e.g. Pine Road and Pine Lane), and no two (2) roads should have similar sounding names (e.g. Beech Street and Peach Street).
(3) Official road name signs. Road signs designating the street name shall be erected by the town for all roads listed in the master index.

town council. An affidavit will be prepared and presented to the town council regarding results of the inspection and providing a recommendation to be considered in the council's decision.
(b) Right-of-way. All streets and roads shall have a minimum right-of-way of fifty (50) feet, except where it can be determined that the purpose and intent of this article can be served and unnecessary hardship would otherwise be produced, then this requirement may be reduced to forty (40) feet. Collector roads shall have a minimum width of traveled way of twenty-two (22) feet and all other streets and roads shall have a minimum width of traveled way of twenty (20) feet. The traveled way should generally be centered in the right-of-way.
(c) Construction. All streets and roads shall be constructed to the following minimum standards; however, the town council may set higher requirements if conditions warrant:
(1) Sub-base. The sub-base shall be compacted and free of vegetation or other deleterious substances, and the entire sub-base shall be covered over with a geo-textile fabric, minumum five (5) ounces.
(2) Base. The base course shall be constructed of eighteen
(18) inches of material specified in the Maine DOT Standard of Specifications for Highways and Bridges, section 703.6, compacted, in place, with no particle exceeding two (2) inches in diameter.

(7) Intersections and curves. Street intersections and curves (vertical and horizontal) shall be so designed as to permit adequate visibility for both pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Curves, in general, shall have a minimum radius of one hundred seventy-five (175) feet and no interchange shall be acceptable at less than ninety (90) degrees for collector roads and sixty (60) degrees for all other streets and roads. Street lines shall be drawn so that intersections shall have a twenty (20) foot minimum curve radius. Any deflection angle in a street line greater than ten (10) degrees shall require a curved street right-of-way. Unless specifically approved, the roadway shall be centered within the right-of-way.
(8) Dead ends. Permanent dead end streets and roads shall be designed at the closed end with a minimum diameter for the street line of not less than one hundred ten (110) feet.

(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-42. Public easement roads and streets.
The town council may consider a street or road for acceptance as a public easement. In such cases there is no specific criteria for the layout and construction of such roadways, but it is highly unlikely that a street or road would be considered for such status unless its condition met reasonable standards which would sustain safe vehicular passage, allow for adequate drainage, and
Supp. No. 27 728.16
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
STREETS AND ROADS § 11-51
provide clearances necessary for unimpeded access of maintenance and snow removal equipment. Once accepted, the maintenance and repair of such roads is at the discretion of the town council, and the town is not required to maintain such roads to the same degree as town ways. Prior to presentation to the town council for acceptance, the town road commissioner, or his/her designated representative, will inspect the road, or section of road to be considered. Based on his/her findings, an affidavit will be prepared for presentation to the town council to include a recommendation of whether or not to accept the roadway as a public easement road or street.

DNISION 5. LIABILITY
Sec. 11-50. Generally.
Municipal liability for road-related mJ uries and damage is governed primarily by the Maine Tort Claims Act and the Highway Liability for Damages Act.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-51. Maine Tort Claims Act.
The Maine Tort Claims Act (14 M.R.S.A. §§ 8101-8118) provides municipalities with broad immunity from liability for negligent acts or omissions. However, there are exceptions to the general rule of governmental entity immunity, and where these exceptions exist, the Tort Claims Act sets a liability cap of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00) for the municipality and ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for municipal employees individually. The Tort Claims Act contains two (2) road-related exceptions through which a municipality may be held liable, and they include situations relating to road maintenance and the operation of vehicles.
(1) Road construction, cleaning, and repair. Under this law, two (2) elements must exist for liability to apply: (1) there must be construction, street cleaning, or repair opera-
Supp. No. 27 728.17
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
§ 11-51 DEXTER CODE
tions performed in a negligent manner, and (2) the injury must arise out of and occur during such operations. Both the injury and the negligence must occur during the cleaning, repair, or construction operation. "Construction" includes the initial building or rebuilding of a bridge or road, as well as building or rebuilding of ditches, shoulders and other components of the road. "Repair" operations includes maintenance paving, ditching, shoulder work, culvert replacement, etc. "Cleaning" means the removal of debris from roads or sidewalks, but does not include snowplowing.
(2) Negligent operation of vehicles. The municipality is liable for its negligent acts or omissions in the ownership, maintenance or use of motor vehicles. This law covers almost every type of vehicle or equipment used in connection with road activities, regardless of whether the vehicle is engaged in repair, construction, snowplowing, or other activities when the injury occurs.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-52. Highway Liability for Damages Act.
23 M.R.S.A. §§ 3651-3655, commonly referred to as the "Pothole Law", requires municipalities to keep town ways in good repair. In this case, the town's liability arises from the physical condition of the road, and not the negligent use of vehicles or equipment. Three (3) factors must be established before the town can be held liable under the "Pothole Law". First, the defect which caused the injury must be on a town way. In this case the town's liability does not extend to public easement roads. Second, the injury or damage must be the result of a highway defect. Third, the town must have had at least 24 hours' prior notice of the defect in question, and failed to correct the problem. Slippery road conditions resulting from snow and ice build-up have been held not to be a "defect" within the scope of this law.
(1) Notice of defect. To be held liable for an injury or damage resulting from a road defect, the town must have at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice (prior to the injury) of the defect. This notice need not be in writing, and it need not come from any particular individual; however, it must be
Supp. No. 27 728.18
Town of Dexter, Maine Section 11 – Streets & Roads
STREETS AND ROADS
§ 11-61
made to a municipal official who is responsible for road safety. Notice must describe the nature and location of the defect with sufficient accuracy so as to allow the town to make proper repairs. A general complaint about poor road conditions will not constitute proper notice.
(Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-53. Sidewalks.
The town is responsible for the upkeep of sidewalks within the right-of-way of both town ways and state/state aid roads in the town. However, unless specified otherwise, the town is not respon- sible for the maintenance and upkeep of sidewalks in the right- of-way of public easement roads. As with roads, while the town must keep sidewalks clear of snow, it is not liable for injuries caused by snow and ice, or slippery conditions on sidewalks. (Ord. No. C2001-29, 11-8-01)
Sec. 11-54. Mailboxes.
The town is not liable for damage done to mailboxes located in the road right-of-way. However, if available, the public works department will provide temporary mailbox posts until such time that a damaged post and mailbox can be erected.

of a wetland may be expanded or altered as follows, as long as other applicable standards of this Ordinance are met:
1. The maximum combined total footprint of all structures may not be expanded to an area greater than one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet or thirty (30) per cent larger than the footprint that existed at the time the resource protection district was established on the lot, whichever is greater.
2. The maximum height of any structure may not be made greater than twenty-five (25) feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever is greater.
3. Any portion of the structures located less than one hundred (100) feet from the normal high- water line of a great pond or a river flowing to a great pond, must meet the footprint and height requirements of subsections 12.C.1.d.3. and 4.

(f) Any approved plan for expansion of a non-conform- ing structure under subsection 12.C.1. must be recorded by the applicant in the registry of deeds of the county in which the property is located within ninety (90) days of the approval. The recorded plan must include the existing and proposed footprint of structures on the property, the existing and proposed height of structures on the property, the shoreland zone boundary, and evidence of approval by the municipal permitting authority.
2. Foundations. Whenever a new, expanded, or replace- ment foundation is constructed under a nonconforming
Supp. No. 37
1243
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
§ 12 DEXTER CODE
structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the shoreline setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria specified in subsection 12.C.3. below.
3. Relocation. A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules (rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the planning board shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegeta- tion. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegeta- tion. Replanting shall be required as follows:
a. Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one (1) native tree, three
(3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five (5) trees are planted, no one (1) species of tree shall make up more than fifty (50) per cent of
Supp. No. 37
1244
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
APPENDIX A—SHORELAND ZONING
§ 12
the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground- cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or groundcover was disturbed, dam- aged or removed must be re-established within the setback area. The vegetation and/or groundcover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or groundcover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
b. Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
4. Reconstruction or replacement. Any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from the normal high-water line of a waterbody, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland and which is removed, damaged, or destroyed regardless of cause, by any per cent of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction, or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced; provided that, a permit is obtained within eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the waterbody, tributary stream, or wetland setback require- ment to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to subsection 12.C.1. above, as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location.
Supp. No. 37
1245
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
§ 12 DEXTER CODE
If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegeta- tion in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with subsec- tion 12.C.3. above.
In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the water setback to the greatest practical extent, the planning board shall consider, in addition to the criteria in subsection 12.C.3. above, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.
5. Change of use of a nonconforming structure. The use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the waterbody, tributary stream, or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent proper- ties and resources than the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the planning board shall require written documenta- tion from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion, and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources, and commercial fishing, and other functionally water-dependent uses.
D. Nonconforming uses.
1. Expansions. Expansions of nonconforming uses are prohibited, except that nonconforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the planning board, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as allowed in subsection 12.C.3.a. above.

2. Resumption of commercial use. A lot in the limited commercial shoreland zone or the general development district may be reestablished with application, review, and approval by the CEO. Conditions may be required based on findings in subsection 16.D. and a public hearing may be held in the consideration of this applica- tion. If a commercial use is established or reestablished on a lot served by public sewer and water, any pre- existing residential use will not be considered a limiting factor.
3. Resumption of other uses in other districts. A lot, build- ing, or structure in or on which a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one (1) year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a nonconforming use except that the planning board may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one-year extension to that time period.
4. In all districts. This provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five-year period.
5. Change of use. An existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources than the former use, as determined by the planning board. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria listed in subsection 12.C.5. above.
E. Nonconforming lots.
1. Nonconforming lots. A nonconforming lot of record as of the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except lot area, lot width and shore frontage can be met.

Variances relating to setback or other requirements not involving lot area, lot width or shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the board of appeals.
2. Contiguous built lots. If two (2) or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot, the nonconforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the state minimum lot size law and State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
If two (2) or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this Ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
3. Contiguous lot—Vacant or partially built. If two (2) or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one (1) or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principal structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirements.
This provision shall not apply to two (2) or more contiguous lots, at least one (1) of which is nonconform- ing, owned by the same person or persons on November 7, 1991, and recorded in the registry of deeds if the lot is served by a public sewer or can accommodate a subsurface sewage disposal system in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules; and
a. Each lot contains at least one hundred (100) feet of shore frontage and at least twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of lot area; or

Section 13. Establishment of districts.
A. Resource protection district. The resource protection district includes areas in which development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or scenic and natural values. This district shall include the following areas when they occur within the limits of the shoreland zone, exclusive of the stream protection district, except that areas which are currently developed and areas which meet the criteria for the limited commercial, or general development districts need not be included within the resource protection district.
1. Areas within two hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of designated freshwater wetlands, and wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated moderate or high value waterfowl and wading bird habitat, including nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) that are depicted on a geographic information system (GIS) data layer maintained by either MDIF&W or the department as of August 1, 2008. For the purposes of this subsection wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegeta- tion and hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond or river, and have a surface elevation at or below the water level of the great pond or river during the period of normal high-water. Wetlands associated with great ponds or rivers are considered to be part of that great pond or river.
2. Floodplains along rivers and floodplains along artificially formed great ponds along rivers, defined by the 100-year

sified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and greater than seventy-five
(75) feet horizontal distance of the normal high-water line of other waterbodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting opera- tions shall not create single clear-cut openings greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in the forest canopy. Where such openings exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet they shall be at least one hundred (100) feet apart. Such clear-cut openings shall be included in the calculation of total volume removal. For the purposes of these standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
b. No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty
(50) feet of the normal high-water line of a waterbody. In all other areas slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends more than four

1269
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
§ 15 DEXTER CODE
f. Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where the operation of machinery used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least one hundred (100) feet in width for slopes up to ten (10) per cent shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water line of a waterbody or upland edge of a wetland. For each ten (10) per cent increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty
(20) feet. The provisions of this subsection apply only to a face sloping toward the waterbody or wetland; provided, however, that no portion of such exposed mineral soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty-five (25) feet from the normal high- water line of a waterbody or upland edge of a wetland.
P. Clearing or removal of vegetation for activities other than timber harvesting.
1. In a resource protection district abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, except to remove safety hazards.
Elsewhere, in any resource protection district the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
2. Except in areas as described in subsection P.1., above, and except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance inland from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from any other waterbody, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
a. There shall be no cleared opening greater than two hundred fifty (250) square feet in the forest canopy
Supp. No. 32
1270
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
APPENDIX A—SHORELAND ZONING
§ 15
(or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present), as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a foot- path not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
b. Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of subsection 15.P.2.b., a "well- distributed stand of trees and other vegetation" adjacent to a great pond classified GPA or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA, shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of twenty- four (24) or more in any twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot rectangular (one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) square feet) area as determined by the following rating system:
Diameter of Tree at 41/2 feet Above
Ground Level (inches) Points
2—?4 in. 1
4—?8 in. 2
8—?12 in. 4
12 in. or greater 8
Adjacent to other waterbodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation" is defined as maintaining a mini- mum rating score, sixteen (16) per twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot rectangular area.
NOTE: As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot plot contains four (4) trees between two (2) and four (4) inches in diame- ter, two (2) trees between four (4) and eight (8) inches in diameter, three (3) trees between eight (8)
Supp. No. 32
1271
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
§ 15 DEXTER CODE
and twelve (12) inches in diameter, and two (2) trees over twelve (12) inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(4 × 1) + (2 × 2) + (3 × 4) + (2 × 8) = 36 points
Thus, the twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot plot contains trees worth thirty-six (36) points. Trees totaling twelve (12) points (36 - 24 =12) may be removed from the plot provided that no cleared openings are cre- ated.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
(i) The twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot rectangular plots must be established where the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;
(ii) Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot;
(iii) Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
(iv) Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the mini- mum points required or as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
(v) Where conditions permit, no more than fifty
(50) per cent of the points on any twenty-five- foot by fifty-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter.
For the purposes of subsection 15.P.2.b. "other natural vegetation" is defined as retaining ex- isting vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other groundcover and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2) inches in diameter at four and one-half (41/2) feet above ground level for each twenty-five-foot by fifty- foot rectangle area. If five (5) saplings do not

APPENDIX A—SHORELAND ZONING
§ 15
exist, no woody stems less than two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until five (5) saplings have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than forty (40) per cent of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at four and one-half (41/2) feet above ground level may be removed in any ten-year period.
c. In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other groundcover including leaf litter and the forest duff layer shall not be cut, covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in subsections
15.P.2. and 15.P.2.a., above.
d. Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom one-third of the tree is allowed.
e. In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present.
Subsection 15.P.2. does not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as, cleared areas, are limited to the minimum area necessary.
3. At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance from a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of any other waterbody, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, except to allow for the development of permitted uses, there shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten-year period, selective cutting of not more than forty (40) per cent of the volume of trees four
(4) inches or more in diameter, measured four and

3. In order to create the least potential for erosion, develop- ment shall be designed to fit with the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
4. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.
5. Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of rip-rap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases permanent stabilization shall occur within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure. In addition:
a. Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred (500) square feet and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.
b. Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg, and twine or other suitable method may be required to maintain the mulch cover.
c. Additional measures shall be taken where neces- sary in order to avoid siltation into the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt fences.
6. Natural and manmade drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion from water flowing through them. Drainage ways shall be designed and constructed in order to carry water from a 25-year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with rip-rap.

tion shall be responsible for management of erosion and sedimentation control practices at the site. This person shall be present at the site each day these activities occur for a duration that is suf- ficient to ensure that proper erosion and sedimenta- tion control practices are followed. This is required until installation of erosion and sedimentation control measures that will either stay in place permanently or stay in place until the area is sufficiently covered with vegetation necessary to prevent soil erosion.
b. Include on the required plan or permit application, the name and certification number of the person who will oversee activities causing or resulting in soil disturbance.
R. Soils. All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or structures can be established or maintained without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe erosion, mass soil movement, improper drain- age, and water pollution, whether during or after construction. Proposed uses requiring subsurface waste disposal, and com- mercial or industrial development and other similar intensive land uses, shall require a soils report based on an on-site investigation and be prepared by state-certified professionals. Certified persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists, Maine Registered Professional Engineers, Maine State-Certi- fied Geologists and other persons who have training and experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties. The report shall be based upon the analysis of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land and water areas, maximum groundwater elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions, and other pertinent data which the evaluator deems appropri- ate. The soils report shall include recommendations for a proposed use to counteract soil limitations where they exist.
S. Water quality. No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or discharge to the waters of the state any pollutant that, by itself or in combination with other activities or substances, will impair designated uses or the water classification of the waterbody tributary stream or wetland.

§ 16 DEXTER CODE
substantial start is made within one (1) year of the issuance of the permit, the applicant shall have one (1) additional year to complete the project, at which time the permit shall expire.
F. Special exceptions. In addition to the criteria specified in subsection 16.D. above, excepting structure setback require- ments, the planning board may approve a permit for a single- family residential structure in a resource protection district provided that the applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
1. There is no location on the property, other than a location within the resource protection district, where the struc- ture can be built.
2. The lot on which the structure is proposed is undeveloped and was established and recorded in the registry of deeds of the county in which the lot is located before the adoption of the resource protection district.
3. All proposed buildings, sewage disposal systems and other improvements are:
a. Located on natural ground slopes of less than twenty
(20) per cent; and
b. Located outside the floodway of the 100-year floodplain along rivers and artificially formed great ponds along rivers, based on detailed flood insurance stud- ies and as delineated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's flood boundary and floodway maps and flood insurance rate maps; all buildings, including basements, are elevated at least one (1) foot above the 100-year floodplain elevation; and the development is otherwise in compliance with any applicable municipal floodplain ordinance.

cessory structures is limited to a maximum of one thou- sand five hundred (1,500) square feet. This limitation shall not be altered by variance.
5. All structures, except functionally water-dependent struc- tures, are set back from the normal high-water line of a waterbody, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland to the greatest practical extent, but not less than seventy- five (75) feet, horizontal distance. In determining the greatest practical extent, the planning board shall con- sider the depth of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the type and amount of vegeta- tion to be removed, the proposed building site's elevation in regard to the floodplain, and its proximity to moderate value and high value wetlands.
G. Installation of public utility service. No public utility, water district, sanitary district or any utility company of any kind may install services to any new structure located in the shoreland zone unless written authorization attesting to the validity and cur- rency of all local permits required under this or any previous ordinance, has been issued by the appropriate municipal officials. Following installation of service, the company or district shall forward the written authorization to the municipal officials, indicating that installation has been completed.
H. Appeals.
1. Powers and duties of the board of appeals. The board of appeals shall have the following powers:
a. Administrative appeals: To hear and decide admin- istrative appeals, on an appellate basis, where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by, or failure to act by, planning board in the administration of this Ordinance; and to hear and decide administrative appeals on a de novo basis where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by, or failure to act by, the code enforcement officer in his or her review of and action on a permit application under this Ordinance. Any
Supp. No. 32
1281
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
§ 16 DEXTER CODE
order, requirement, decision or determination made, or failure to act, in the enforcement of this Ordi- nance is appealable to the board of appeals.
b. Variance appeals: To authorize variances upon ap- peal, within the limitations set forth in this Ordi- nance.
2. Variance appeals. Variances may be granted only under the following conditions:
a. Variances may be granted only from dimensional requirements including, but not limited to, lot width, structure height, per cent of lot coverage and set- back requirements.
b. Variances shall not be granted for establishment of any uses otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance.
c. The board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that:
(1) The proposed structure or use would meet the provisions of section 15 except for the specific provision which has created the nonconformity and from which relief is sought; and
(2) The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship.
The term "undue hardship" shall mean:
(i) That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;
(ii) That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neigh- borhood;
(iii) That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the local- ity; and
(iv) That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.

§ 16
3. Notwithstanding subsection 16.H.2.c.(2) above, the board of appeals may grant a variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construc- tion of structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with the disability. The board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in the dwelling. The term "structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling" shall include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
4. The board of appeals shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to in- sure conformance with the purposes and provi- sions of this Ordinance to the greatest extent possible, and in doing so may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary. The party receiving the variance shall comply with any conditions imposed.
5. A copy of each variance request, including the application and all supporting information sup- plied by the applicant, shall be forwarded by the municipal officials to the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days prior to action by the board of appeals. Any comments received from the commissioner prior to the action by the board of appeals shall be made part of the record and shall be taken into consideration by the board of appeals.

Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix A – Shoreland Zoning
§ 16 DEXTER CODE
of appeals shall hold a "de novo" hearing. At this time the board may receive and consider new evidence and testi- mony, be it oral or written. When acting in a "de novo" capacity, the board of appeals shall hear and decide the matter afresh, undertaking its own independent analysis of evidence and the law, and reaching its own decision.
When the board of appeals hears a decision of the plan- ning board, it shall hold an appellate hearing, and may reverse the decision of the planning board only upon finding that the decision was contrary to specific provi- sions of the ordinance or contrary to the facts presented to the planning board. The board of appeals may only review the record of the proceedings before the planning board. The board appeals shall not receive or consider any evidence which was not presented to the planning board, but the board of appeals may receive and consider written or oral arguments. If the board of appeals determines that the record of the planning board proceedings are inade- quate, the board of appeals may remand the matter to the planning board for additional fact finding.

B. The dividing of a tract or parcel of land and the lot or lots so made, which dividing or lots when made are not subject to this subchapter, do not become subject to this subchapter by the subsequent dividing of that parcel of land or any portion of that tract or parcel. The municipal reviewing authority shall consider the existence of the previously created lot or lots in reviewing a proposed subdivision created by a subsequent dividing.

Article IV. Instructions to applicant.
4.1. Procedure. The review of a subdivision shall consist of three (3) steps as outlined below:
4.1.1. Submission of a sketch plan. The sketch plan shall consist of a rough outline of the proposed subdivision and may be a freehand, penciled sketch of the parcel, showing the proposed layout of streets, lots, and other features which may be of assistance to the planning board in making its determinations. In order for the planning board to be more fully informed about the site, the subdivider shall arrange a joint inspection of the site with the planning board, or an individual appointed by the chairman to act as the board's representative. The on-site inspection may be conducted at, or shortly after the submission of the sketch plan, but this phase of the application process will not be considered complete until such inspection has been made.
4.1.2. Submission of a preliminary plat plan. Upon submission of a sketch plan, and following an on-site inspection, the planning board will outline, by checking specific items on this application, the specific requirements for preliminary plat submission. Specific requirements will vary accord- ing to the size and complexity of the subdivision proposal. In some instances, the planning board may waive the requirement for a preliminary plat plan submittal, in which case this application form must be submitted with the final plan. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of application, the board will determine that the application is complete, or if incomplete, will request additional information. If requested information is not provided within ninety (90) days the application will be deemed to have been withdrawn. Within thirty (30) days of deter- mining that the application is complete, the board will hold a public hearing. The preliminary plan may be approved at the same meeting as the public hearing, or within thirty (30) days of the public hearing. This time period maybe extended by mutual agreement of the board and the subdivider if the public hearing uncovers a need for additional information. The planning board may re-

quire the applicant to pay into a special account the cost to the town of hiring independent consulting services for assistance in reviewing applications and to provide proj- ect inspection as needed. The fee shall be determined after the planning board has secured an estimate of the cost of the services and the applicant has seen the estimate. If the balance in the special account established for the

purpose is drawn down by seventy-five (75) percent the board shall notify the applicant and require an additional amount. Any balance in the account remaining after a final decision on the application shall be returned to the applicant.
4.1.3. Submission of a final plat plan. After any apparent deficiencies in the preliminary plan have been corrected, a final plat plan must be submitted to the planning board. Your application for subdivision approval will not be considered complete until the final plat plan has been submitted. The board may place a condition on the final approved plan that any necessary DEP permits be ob- tained prior to the start of development, and that subdi- visions that fall under the Site Location Act (Title 38
M.R.S.A. § 481-490) obtain necessary permits prior to the start of development. The final plat plan shall consist of one (1) original and three (3) copies of all maps or drawings similar to the maps or drawings prepared for preliminary plat submission, except that space should be reserved on the plat plan for the endorsement of all appropriate agencies, and for the attachment of specific conditions of approval. In addition, items checked on the form entitled "Notification of Requirements for Final Plat Plan" will be considered complete. Specific details con- cerning the drafting of the plat plan may be found in Appendix 1. All applications for final plan approval for subdivisions shall be accompanied by an application fee of eighty dollars ($80.00) plus twenty dollars ($20.00) per lot or dwelling unit, payable by check to the Town of Dexter. An additional fee to cover the additional costs of adver- tising and postal service if the application reaches the public hearing stage will be required.
4.1.4. The planning board shall, within sixty (60) days from the date of submission, approve or disapprove the final plan. The board shall specify in writing the reasons for any disapproval.

(c) The board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that:
i. The proposed structure or use would meet the standards of this Ordinance except for the specific provision which has created the non- conformity and from which relief is sought; and
ii. The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship. The term undue hardship shall mean all of
the following:
a. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;
b. That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;

d. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
(d) The board of appeals shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to insure conformance with the purposes and provisions of this Ordinance to the greatest extent possible, and in doing so may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary. The party receiving the variance shall comply with any conditions imposed.
(e) If a variance is granted under this section, a certificate indicating the name of the current property owner, identifying the property by refer- ence to the last recorded deed in its chain of title and indicating the fact that a variance, including any conditions on the variance, has been granted
Supp. No. 37
1623
Town of Dexter, Maine Appendix C – Land Use
§ 5 DEXTER CODE
and the date of the granting, shall be prepared in recordable form. The certificate must be recorded in the local registry of deeds within thirty (30) days of the final approval of the variance or the variance is void. The variance is not valid until recorded as provided in this provision. The costs for the record- ing of any variance granted shall be borne by the applicant.
B. Appeal procedure.
1. Time limit. An administrative or variance appeal may be taken to the board of appeals from any decision of the code enforcement officer. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the date of the decision appealed from.

Appendix B. Outdoor Wood Boilers.
Statement of purpose. The purposes of this appendix are to ensure that outdoor wood boilers are operated in a manner that limit particulate discharges, create no nuisance to neighbors, and protect members of the community from harmful levels of smoke and other emissions.
Sec. 86-01. Legislative intent and findings.
A. Outdoor wood boilers are alternative sources for heat and hot water production and when operated improperly create significant amounts of particulate and smoke discharges that threaten public health, welfare and safety.
B. Outdoor wood boilers are becoming more common, but government at the federal and state levels has not yet addressed their emissions issues, although the U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency is currently considering regulations for outdoor wood boilers.
C. Significant emissions from outdoor wood boilers can have very negative effects or potential effects on the personal health and enjoyment of property of residents.
D. It is the intent of this chapter to serve the town’s compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Dexter by regulating outdoor wood boilers within its borders.
E. Authority for this Ordinance is found in article 8, part 2,
§ 1 of the State of Maine Constitution, also known as the Home Rule provision, and the Dexter Town Charter.
(Ord. No. C2007-2, 4-12-07)
Sec. 86-02. Permit required.
No person shall install, use or maintain an outdoor wood boiler within the Town of Dexter without first having obtained a permit from the code enforcement officer. Application for such permit shall be made to the code enforcement officer on forms provided. The permit fee shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) and this fee may be adjusted by council order.

Any outdoor wood boiler in existence, installed and operating/ operable on the effective date of [the ordinance from which this section derives] shall be allowed to remain provided that the owner applies for and receives a permit from the code enforce- ment officer within sixty (60) days of such effective date, provided, however, that upon the effective date of [the ordinance from which this section derives] all the provisions hereof, except for those found in section 86-04, subsection (B) below, shall immediately apply to existing outdoor wood boilers. If the owner of an outdoor wood boiler does not receive a permit within sixty
(60) days of the effective date of [the ordinance from which this section derives], the owner shall immediately cease operations of the boiler until such time as the conditions for a permit are met. Existing or in existence means that the outdoor wood boiler is in place on-site.

boiler shall be required to display a listing plate on the unit that certifies that the unit is in compliance with the appropriate emissions standard, as determined by a qualified testing facility using appropriate and applicable Underwriter Laboratories (UL), ANSI, CSA or NSF Standard.
(D) Stack height. The stack height of an outdoor wood boiler will be at least twenty-four (24) inches above the roofline of the closest neighbor’s residence abutting the property where the boiler is installed if the neighbor’s residence is within three hundred (300) feet of the boiler installation site.

A permit issued pursuant to this Ordinance may be suspended, as the code enforcement officer deems necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Town of Dexter. Grounds for suspension of the permit shall include, but not be limited to, malodorous air contaminants caused by the burning of nonpermitted materials in the outdoor wood boiler. A suspended permit may be reinstated once the condition that caused the suspension is remedied and reasonable assurances are given that such condition will not recur. Recurrence of a condition, which has previously resulted in suspension of a permit, shall be considered a violation of this chapter and be subject to the penalties provided in section 86-07 below.

Sec. 86-06. Appeals and waivers.
(A) Appeals. An outdoor wood boiler owner may appeal, in writing, the code enforcement officer’s denial or suspension of a permit to the Dexter Board of Appeals. The board of appeals will consider such appeals in open session under its guidelines and bylaws. If the decision of the code enforcement officer is upheld, the suspension of the permit will continue until such time as the boiler is brought into compliance with this chapter or discontinued from use. During the appeal process, however, the outdoor wood boiler shall not be used in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood.
(B) Waivers. The Dexter Board of Appeals shall have the authority to grant waivers under this chapter due to extraordinary and undue hardship, upon written request of an affected property owner to the board of appeals. The board of appeals shall consider the waiver request in open session under the guidelines and bylaws of the board of appeals. Any waiver granted shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purposes of this chapter and the board of appeals may impose such conditions and requirements, as it deems reasonable and prudent. If the board of appeals denies the waiver request, the outdoor wood boiler in question must be brought into full compliance with this chapter or its use be discontinued immediately.
