supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the code and
will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially
obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been
inserted, the code will be current through the date of the adoption of the
latest ordinance included in the supplement.

(meaning the person, agency, or organization authorized to prepare the
supplement) may make formal, non-substantive changes in ordinances and parts

sections and other divisions of the code printed in the supplement, and make

same meaning to “this chapter”, “this subchapter”, “this
division”, and the like, as the case may be, or to “sections _____

code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into
the code); and



      (5)   Make other non-substantive changes necessary to preserve
the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code; but in no
case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.



§ 10.10  APPEARANCE TICKETS.

part thereof, other than that part affected by the decision.



§ 10.99  GENERAL PENALTY.



   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this code for any
particular provision or section, every person convicted of a violation of any
provision of this code or any rule or regulation adopted or issued in
pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500 and
costs of prosecution or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or by both
such fine and imprisonment; unless there is a fine or penalty specifically
set forth in the ordinance which provides for a greater penalty, and in that
event, such greater penalty shall control. Each act of violation and every
day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate
offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is
expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any section of this code
whether or not such penalty is re-enacted in the amendatory ordinance.

ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE FOR RESIDENTIAL UNITS SERVING LOW OR MODERATE INCOME
PERSONS




§ 30.45  PURPOSE.



   This subchapter authorizes and approves an annual service charge in
lieu of taxes for residential housing developments that:



   (A)   Serve low income or moderate income persons (as defined in the
State Housing Development Authority Act, Public Act 346 of 1966, being
M.C.L.A. §§ 125.1404 through 125.1499, s amended, and this subchapter);



   (B)   Are financed or assisted by USDA-RD or the Authority in
accordance with Public Act 346 of 1966, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.1404 through
125.1499;



   (C)   Are located within the city; and



   (D)   Comply with this subchapter.



(Ord. 334, passed 2-13-2012)



§ 30.46  TITLE.



   This subchapter shall be known and cited as the “City of Linden Tax
Exemption Ordinance” and may be referred to herein as “this subchapter”
or “subchapter”.



(Ord. 334, passed 2-13-2012)



§ 30.47  PREAMBLE.



   (A)   It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the
state and its political subdivisions to provide housing for low income
citizens and to encourage the development of such housing by providing for a
service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with Public Act 346 of
1966, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.1404 through 125.1499. The city is authorized
by Public Act 346 of 1966, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.1404 through 125.1499 and
this subchapter to establish or change the annual service charge to be paid
in lieu of taxes by any and all classes of housing exempt from taxation under
Public Act 346 of 1966, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.1404 through 125.1499 at any
amount it chooses not to exceed the taxes that would be paid but for Public
Act 346 of 1966, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.1404 through 125.1499. It is further
acknowledged that housing for low income persons and families is a public
necessity and, as the city will be benefitted and improved by such housing,
the encouragement of the same by providing certain real estate tax exemptions
for such housing is a valid public purpose; further, that the continuance of
the provisions of this subchapter for tax exemption and the service charge in
lieu of taxes during the period contemplated in this subchapter are essential
to the determination of economic feasibility of housing developments which
are constructed and financed in reliance on such tax exemption.



   (B)   The city acknowledges that Venture Willow Haven LDHA LP (the
“sponsor” as defined in § 30.48) has committed to construct, own, and
operate a housing development identified as “Venture Willow Haven LDHA
LP” on certain property located on 815 S. Bridge within the city which is
legally described in the definition for “housing development” in §
30.48, to serve low income or moderate income persons, and that the sponsor
has offered to pay and will pay to the city, on account of the housing

calendar month or any part of a calendar month added until paid. Such charges
belong to the city and constitute a charge, and shall be a lien against the
property to which the special assessments apply, collectible in the same
manner as special assessments which they are added. If summer taxes are
collected by the city, collection shall be in accordance with the provisions
of Public Acts 333 of 1982, as amended.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.130)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.14  SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.



   Special assessments and all interest, charges, and penalties thereon,
from the date of confirmation of the roll and until paid, shall be and remain
a lien upon the property assessed of the same character and effect as the
lien created for city taxes. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the City
Council vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of
the city upon the property assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may
be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding
might be lawfully assessed thereon.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.140)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.15  COLLECTION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.



   When any special assessment shall be confirmed, the City Assessor shall
direct the assessments so made in the special assessment roll to be
collected. The Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the City Treasurer said
special assessment roll to which the City Assessor shall attach his or her
warrant commanding the City Treasurer to collect from each of the persons
assessed in said roll the amount of money assessed to and set opposite his or
her name therein. Upon receiving said special assessment roll and warrant,
the City Treasurer shall proceed to collect the several amounts assessed
therein.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.150)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.16  COLLECTION BY COURT ACTION.



   In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien
thereon, any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and
penalties, may be collected in an action of assumpsit in the name of the city
against the person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction. If in any such
action it shall appear that by reason of irregularities or informalities the
assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the
premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory
proof that the expense has been incurred by the city, which in a proper
charge against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for
the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.160)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.17  DIVISION OF LAND ASSESSED.



   Should any lot, premises, or parcel of land be divided after a special
assessment has been levied thereon and confirmed and divided into
installments, and before the collection of any installment thereof, the City
Council may require the City Assessor to apportion the uncollected amount
upon the several parts of said lot, premises, or parcel of land so divided.
Upon receipt of this special assessment roll apportioned as stated from the
Assessor, proceedings shall be taken leading to the review and confirmation
of the roll as apportioned in the same manner as proceedings are taken for
the review and confirmation of the proposed special assessments generally.
When the special assessment roll as apportioned shall have been confirmed, it
shall be conclusive upon all parties in interest.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.170)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.18  ADDITIONAL PRO RATA ASSESSMENTS.



   Additional pro rata assessments may be made when any special assessment
roll proves insufficient to pay for the improvement for which it was levied
and the expenses incidental thereto, or insufficient to pay the principal and
interest on bonds issued in anticipation of such special assessment roll;
provided that the additional pro rata special assessment shall not exceed 20%
of the special assessment as originally confirmed, unless a meeting of the
City Council be held to review such additional assessment, for which meeting
notices shall be published and mailed as provided in the case of review of
the original proposed special assessment roll.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.180)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.19  REASSESSMENT IN EVENT OF ILLEGALITY.



   Whenever any special assessment roll, in the opinion of the City
Council, is invalid by reason of irregularity in proceedings, or if any court
of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the
City Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether
any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment
was made. All proceedings of such reassessment and for the collection thereof
shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original special
assessment; and whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any
premises has been so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded,
the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment and the
reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.190)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.20  MONIES RAISED BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.



   Monies raised by special assessments for any public improvement shall
be credited to a special assessment account and shall be used to pay for the
costs of the improvement for which the special assessment was levied and of
expenses incidental thereto, to repay the principal and interest on money
borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments. The excess by which
any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement
and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the General Fund of the city
if such excess is less than 5% of the assessment. Should the assessment prove
larger than necessary by 5% or more, the entire excess shall be refunded on a
pro rata basis to the owners of the property assessed. Said refund shall be
made by credit against future unpaid installments in the inverse order in
which they are payable, to the extent such installments then exist, and the
balance of such refunds shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which
contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured
in whole or in part by said special assessment.



(2011 Code, § 3.04.200)  (Ord. 169, passed - -1992)



§ 32.21  OTHER SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.



   When any expense shall have been incurred by the city upon or in
respect to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against said
premises and the owner thereof under the provisions of any ordinance of the
city or law or statute of the state, and is not of that class required to be
pro rated among the several lots, and parcels of land in a special assessment
district, an account of the labor, material, and service for which such
expense was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect
to which the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall
be reported to the City Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the
owner, if known. In the event that the Treasurer finds that such an amount is
not otherwise collectable, he or she shall report the same to the City
Council which may direct the City Clerk to prepare a special assessment roll
covering all such charges reported to it, together with a penalty of 4%. Such
roll shall be filed with the City Clerk, who shall present the same to the
City Council. Thereafter, the same proceedings shall be followed in respect
to such special assessment roll as are provided in this chapter and all the
provisions of said sections with reference to special assessments generally
shall apply to special assessments under this section, insofar as the same
may be applicable.

(Ord. 382, passed - -2018)



§ 33.05  MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.



   (A)   Bureau established; employees.  The city hereby designates
the City Clerk as the Municipal Ordinance Violations Bureau (“Bureau”) as
authorized under Public Act 236 of 1961, Section 8396, being M.C.L.A. §
600.8396, to accept admissions of responsibility for municipal civil
infractions in response to municipal civil infraction violation notices
issued and served by authorized city officials, and to collect and retain
civil fines and costs as prescribed by resolution of City Council.  The City
Clerk may assign the functions and responsibilities of Bureau operation to a
deputy or, with the approval of the City Council, to any qualified city
employee.



   (B)   Location; supervision.  The Bureau shall be located at the
City of Linden City Hall, 132 E. Broad Street, Linden, Michigan 48451, and
shall be under the supervision and control of the City Clerk.



   (C)   Disposition of violations.  The Bureau may dispose only of
municipal civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and
for which a municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a
citation) has been issued.  The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a
particular violation shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation
at the Bureau.  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the city
from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any violation or from
prosecuting any violation in a court of competent jurisdiction.  The
unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall
not prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person’s rights,
privileges and protection accorded by law.

The scope of the Bureau’s authority shall be limited to accepting
admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting
and retaining fines and costs as a result of those admissions.  The Bureau
shall not accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having
committed the offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and
in no event shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or
falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged violation.



   (E)   Municipal civil infraction violation notices.  Municipal
civil infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized
city officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as
provided for citations as provided in this chapter.  In addition to any
other information required by this or any other ordinance of the city, the
notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged violator
must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be made,
the address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which the
Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation,
and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within
the required time.



   (F)   Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator
receiving a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the
Bureau and pay the specified fine and costs no later than 14 days after the
date of the violation notice.  An appearance may be made by mail, in person
or by representation.



   (G)   Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine
not paid. If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal
ordinance violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made
and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for
the violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction
citation may be filed with District Court and a copy of the citation may be
served by first class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged
violator’s last known address.  The citation filed with the court does not
need to comply in all particulars with the requirements for citations as
provided by Public Act 236 of 1961, Sections 8705 and 8709, being M.C.L.A.
§§ 600.8705 and 600.8709, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing
the allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall
fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.



(Ord. 382, passed - -2018)



§ 33.06  PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS.



   (A)   The sanction for a violation which is a municipal civil
infraction shall be a civil fine in an amount set by resolution of City
Council, plus any costs, damages, expenses and other sanctions, as authorized
under Public Act 236 of 1961, Chapter 87, being M.C.L.A. §§ 600.8701 et
seq., and other applicable laws.



      (1)   Unless otherwise specified by resolution of City
Council, the civil fine for a violation shall be not less than $50, plus
costs and other sanctions, for each infraction.



      (2)   Increased civil fines may be imposed for repeated
violations by a person of any requirement or provision of this or any other
city ordinance.  As used in this section, “repeat offense” means any
subsequent municipal infraction violation of the same requirement or
provision committed by a person within any 12-month period (unless some other
period is specifically provided by this or any other city ordinance) and for
which the person admits responsibility or is determined to be responsible. 
Unless otherwise specified by resolution of City Council, the increased fine
for a repeat offense shall be as follows:



         (a)   A second repeat offense shall be no less than
$100, plus costs.



         (b)   A third repeat offense shall be no less than $200,
plus costs.



         (c)   A “violation” includes any act which is
prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful or an offense by this or any
other city ordinance; and any omission or failure to act where the act is
required by this chapter or any city ordinance.



         (d)   Each day on which any violation of this or any
other city ordinance continues constitutes a separate offense and shall be
subject to penalties or sanctions as a separate offense.



   (B)   In addition to any remedies available at law, the city may
bring an action for an injunction or other process against a person to
restrain, prevent or abate any violation of this chapter or any city
ordinance.

the vehicles, equipment, and all materials stored therein; provided that such
wall or fence shall not measure less than four feet, six inches in height

§ 114.002  INTENT.



   The city finds that the development of telecommunications systems and
the availability of such services within the community holds a potential for
providing public benefit for residents. Because of the complex and rapidly
changing technology associated with telecommunications systems, the city
finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be
served by establishing certain regulatory powers vested in the city or such
persons as the city shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and
subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best
possible public interest and public purpose associated with the creation and
operation of local telecommunications system(s) within the community. The
city in addition finds that any and all telecommunication systems wishing to
utilize the public streets and rights-of-way shall be subject to city
regulation to the fullest extent possible consistent with law, and that all
such telecommunications systems may only offer service within the community
under franchise, and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

§ 114.045  REMEDIES FOR FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   If a grantee fails to perform any obligation under a franchise
awarded hereunder, or fails to do so in a timely manner, the grantor may at
its option, and in its sole discretion:



      (1)   Assess against a grantee monetary damages up to the
limits established in a franchise agreement for material franchise
violations, which a grantee hereby agrees to pay, said assessment to be
levied against the security fund, herein above provided, and collected by the
grantor immediately upon said assessment. The grantor and a grantee agree
that the amount of such assessment shall be deemed, without proof, to
represent liquidation of damages actually sustained by the grantor by a
reason of a grantee’s failure to perform. Such assessment shall not
constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have
under a franchise awarded hereunder or under applicable law, including
without limitation, its right to recover from a grantee such additional
damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including actual attorney fees, as may
have been suffered or incurred by the grantor by reason of or arising out of
such breach of a franchise awarded hereunder. This provision for assessment
of damages is intended by the parties to be separate and apart from the
grantor’s right to enforce the provisions of the construction and
performance bonds provided for in §§ 114.105 through 114.110 and is
intended to provide compensation to the grantor for actual damages;



      (2)   As may be provided in a franchise awarded hereunder,
violations considered by the grantor to have materially degraded the quality
of service, order and direct a grantee to issue rebates or reduce its rates
and/or charges to users, in an amount solely determined by the grantor and
provided for within a franchise awarded hereunder, to provide monetary relief
substantially equal to the reduced quality of service resulting from a
grantee’s failure to perform;



      (3)   Require, subject to existing federal law and FCC rules,
that a grantee cure all defaults and breaches of its obligations hereunder
before a grantee is entitled to increase any rate or charge to users
hereunder as may be specified within a franchise awarded hereunder; and/or



      (4)   Terminate a franchise awarded hereunder, for any of the
causes stated within this chapter.



   (B)   No remedy shall be imposed by the grantor against a grantee
for any violation of this franchise without a grantee being afforded due
process of law, as provided within this chapter.



   (C)   The grantor may, in its sole judgment and discretion, impose
any or all of the above enumerated measures against a grantee, which shall be
in addition to any and all other legal or equitable remedies it has under
this franchise or under any applicable law.



(2011 Code, § 14.04.160)  Penalty, see § 114.999



§ 114.046  PROCEDURE FOR REMEDYING FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   In the event that the grantor determines that a grantee has
violated any provision of a franchise awarded hereunder, any rule or
regulation promulgated pursuant hereto or any applicable federal, state, or
local law, the grantor may make a written demand on a grantee as provided
within a franchise awarded hereunder, that it remedy such violation.



   (B)   If the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not
remedied to the satisfaction of the grantor within 30 days following such
demand, the grantor shall determine whether or not such violation, breach,
failure, refusal, or neglect by a grantee was excusable or inexcusable, in
accordance with the following procedure.



      (1)   A public hearing shall be held and a grantee shall be
provided with an opportunity to be heard upon 30 days’ written notice to a
grantee of the time and place of the hearing provided and the allegations of
franchise violations.



      (2)   If, after notice is given and, at a grantor’s option,
a full public proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation,
breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by a grantee was excusable as provided
within this chapter, the grantor shall direct a grantee to correct or remedy
the same within such additional time, in such manner, and upon such terms and
conditions as the grantor may direct.



      (3)   If, after notice is given and, at a grantor’s option,
a full proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation,
breach, failure, refusal, or neglect was inexcusable, then the grantor may
assess a penalty or remedy in accordance with § 114.045 above.



      (4)   If, after notice is given and, at a grantor’s option,
a full public proceeding is held, the grantor declares a franchise awarded
hereunder or any renewal thereof breached, the parties may pursue their
remedies pursuant to a franchise or any other remedy, legal or equitable.

§ 114.047  FORCE MAJEURE; GRANTEE’S INABILITY TO PERFORM.



   In the event a grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions,
obligations, or requirements of a franchise awarded hereunder is prevented or
impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably
foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no
penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided a
grantee has notified the grantor in writing within 30 days of its discovery
of the occurrence of such an event. Such causes beyond a grantee’s
reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not
be limited to, acts of God and civil emergencies.



(2011 Code, § 14.04.180)




GRANT OF FRANCHISE




§ 114.060  GENERAL.



   (A)   In the event that the grantor shall grant to a grantee a
nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, and maintain a
telecommunications system within a franchise area, a franchise awarded
hereunder shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the
services of a telecommunications system as required by the provisions of this
chapter and a franchise agreement. A franchise agreement shall include those
provisions of a grantee’s application for franchise that are finally
negotiated and accepted by the grantor and grantee.



   (B)   Regarding any franchise granted hereunder, the terms and
conditions contained herein shall be consistent with the grantor charter
and/or statutory requirements, which are incorporated by this reference as if
fully set forth herein.



   (C)   Any franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general
provisions of this chapter or hereafter made effective. Nothing in a
franchise awarded hereunder shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the
various codes and ordinances of the grantor regarding permits, fees to be
paid, or manner of construction.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.010)



§ 114.061  FRANCHISE TERRITORY.



   No franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall exclude any area,
portion, or part of the city. Any grantee awarded a franchise as provided by
this chapter shall plan, design, and construct a system capable of providing
services to all residential and commercial units within the city as provided
within a franchise awarded hereunder. The service area shall be the entire
incorporated geographical limits of the city. The initial service shall be
that portion of the franchise territory scheduled to receive initial service,
as stated in a franchise agreement.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.020)



§ 114.062  USE OF PUBLIC STREETS AND WAYS.



   For the purpose of operating and maintaining a telecommunications
system in a franchise area subject to the provisions of this chapter, a
grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, and
retain in, on, over, under, across, and along the public streets and ways
within a franchise territory such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits,
vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments, and other
property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of
the cable communications system. Prior to construction or alteration,
however, a grantee shall, in each case, file plans with the appropriate
grantor agencies and local utility companies and receive written approval
before proceeding.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.030)



§ 114.063  DURATION.



   The term of any franchise and all rights, privileges, obligations, and
restrictions pertaining thereto shall be established by a franchise
agreement, however, no franchise term may exceed ten years from the effective
date of a franchise awarded hereunder. The effective date of a franchise
awarded hereunder shall be the date of execution of a franchise agreement by
the grantor, subject to prior execution by a grantee.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.040)



§ 114.064  FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE.



   A franchise granted is nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves
the right to grant, subject to all terms and conditions of this chapter, such
additional franchises for a telecommunications system at any time as it deems
appropriate.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.050)



§ 114.065  TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



   (A)   Subject to provisions of any effective FCC rules, any
franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit
of the public. Said franchise cannot in any event be sold, transferred,
leased, assigned, or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or other means without
the prior consent of the grantor, and then only under such conditions as the
grantor may establish, and such consent as required by the grantor shall not
be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that no such authorization shall
be required for any such transfer to a parent, subsidiary, or subsidiary of a
parent of a grantee. If any transfer of a franchise occurs without the prior
consent of the grantor, a franchise awarded hereunder may, at grantor’s
sole option, be terminated immediately. No authorization of the grantor shall
be required for any mortgage, pledge, or other encumbrance of this agreement
of a grantee’s cable system as security for monies borrowed.



   (B)   A grantee shall notify the grantor within 30 days of any
actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other
party of, control of a grantee. The word control as used herein is not
limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever
manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has
occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or
group of persons of 10% of the voting shares of a grantee. Every change,
transfer, or acquisition of control of a grantee shall make a franchise
awarded hereunder subject to termination unless and until the grantor shall
have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that no such authorization shall be required for any
mortgage, pledge, or other encumbrance of the stock of a grantee as security
for monies borrowed. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire
into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party and a grantee
shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry. In seeking the grantor’s
consent to any change in ownership or control, a grantee shall have the
responsibility:



      (1)   To show to the reasonable satisfaction of the grantor
whether the proposed purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the “proposed
transferee”) which in the case of a corporation, shall include all
officers, directors, employees, and all persons having a legal or equitable
interest in 5% or more of its voting stock, or any of the proposed
transferee’s principals:



         (a)   Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts
involving moral turpitude, including, but not limited to, any violation of
federal, state, or local law or regulations, or is presently under an
indictment, investigation, or complaint charging such acts;



         (b)   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any
court of competent jurisdiction; and/or



         (c)   Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit, or
administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system.



      (2)   To establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of the
grantor, the financial solvency of the proposed transfer by submitting all
current financial data for the proposed transferee which a grantee was
required to submit in its franchise application, and such other data as the
grantor may request. Financial statements shall be audited, certified, and
qualified by an independent certified public accountant, approved by the
grantor; and/or



      (3)   To establish to the satisfaction of the grantor that the
financial and technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as
shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining
term of a franchise under the existing franchise terms.



   (C)   The grantor agrees that any financial institution having a
pledge of a franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the
construction and/or operation of a franchise awarded hereunder shall have the
right to notify the grantor that it or its designee, satisfactory to the
grantor, will take control and operate the cable television system, in the
event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said
financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements
during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system.
The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a
period exceeding one year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion
and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the
grantor to transfer franchise to another grantee. If the grantor finds that
such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical,
and other public interest qualities of the applicant, is satisfactory, the
grantor will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise
as in the public interest. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall
not be unreasonably withheld.



   (D)   The consent or approval of the grantor to any transfer of a
grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the grantor
in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter.



   (E)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, as determined
by the grantor in its sole judgment, the grantor will not approve any
transfer or assignment of a franchise awarded hereunder prior to substantial
completion of construction of the proposed system.



   (F)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to a
franchise agreement.

§ 114.066  FRANCHISE RENEWAL.



   (A)   Renewal not required. Unless otherwise required by federal law
or FCC rules, nothing in any franchise agreement shall require renewal of a
franchise by the grantor after the term of a franchise awarded hereunder has
expired.



   (B)   Term. The renewal of any franchise shall be set by a franchise
agreement but shall not be greater than ten years.



   (C)   Renewal procedure.



      (1)   A franchise renewal procedure may be established within
a franchise awarded hereunder. A nonrefundable application fee established by
the grantor in an amount necessary to cover the costs of processing the
request for renewal may be imposed by the grantor.



      (2)   A franchise renewal application when filed shall be
available for public inspection at places designated by the grantor. As
provided within a franchise awarded hereunder, a public hearing may be held
on the application where a grantee’s record of compliance with a franchise
requirement, its record of satisfactory service, and the terms and conditions
proposed for a franchise renewal period shall be reviewed.



      (3)   Following receipt of a request for renewal of a
franchise granted hereunder, the grantor shall initiate a review process
which shall determine a grantee’s past level of overall compliance with a
franchise agreement, its level of services, its application of new
technology, and cooperation with the grantor to best meet the community needs.



      (4)   At a time determined by the grantor, the grantee will be
invited to provide a formal franchise renewal application. The application
shall set forth in detail a franchisee’s legal, character, financial, and
other pertinent qualifications sufficient to make a determination to renew or
terminate such franchise.



      (5)   Based upon the above criteria, the grantor may, at its
sole option, decide to renew a franchise awarded hereunder under appropriate
terms and conditions, or not to renew a franchise awarded hereunder.



      (6)   If the grantor’s decision is not to renew a franchise,
the grantor may initiate public solicitations for applications for a new
franchise. The original grantee shall not be precluded from submitting such
an application.



      (7)   In any renewal or public solicitation, the grantor may
require additional services, system upgrade, or any other conditions it deems
feasible and appropriate in the light of the state of the art of the cable
communications industry at that time.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.070)



§ 114.067  POLICE POWERS.



   (A)   In accepting a franchise awarded hereunder, a grantee
acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the
grantor to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and
welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general
laws and ordinances enacted by the grantor pursuant to such power.



   (B)   Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any
other present or future lawful exercise of the grantor’s police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that
is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to
any grantee or telecommunications system which contains provisions
inconsistent with a franchise shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the
grantor finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety,
property, or general welfare of such exercise is mandated by law.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.080)



§ 114.068  FRANCHISE FEE.



   (A)   Annual franchise payment. A grantee awarded hereunder shall
pay to the grantor an annual fee in an amount as designated in a franchise
agreement for the use of the public rights-of-way. Such payment shall be in
addition to any other franchise requirement and commence as of the effective
date of a franchise awarded hereunder. At the request of the grantor, the
grantee shall furnish a statement, certified by an officer of a grantee,
reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and all payments,
deductions, and computations for the period covered by the payment.



   (B)   Acceptance by grantor. No acceptance of any payment by the
grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other
obligation of a grantee.



   (C)   Failure to make required payment. In the event that any
franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates
specified herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation:



      (1)   An interest charge, computed from such due date, at the
annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate in effect upon the
due date or as otherwise established within a franchise awarded hereunder; and



      (2)   A sum of money equal to 5% of the amount due in order to
defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by the grantor by reason
of delinquent payment.



   (D)   Payment computation. Payment due the grantor under this
provision shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter as of March
31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. Each quarterly payment shall be
due and payable no later than 30 days after the dates listed in the previous
sentence. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report showing the
basis for the computation and such other relevant facts as may be required by
the grantor.



   (E)   Fee payment initiation. Following the issuance and acceptance
of a franchise awarded hereunder, a grantee shall initiate franchise fee
payments to the grantor at the intervals and rate specified in a franchise
agreement.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.090)



§ 114.069  FORFEITURE OR REVOCATION.



   (A)   Grounds for revocation. The grantor reserves the right to
revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with a franchise awarded hereunder in the following circumstances,
each of which shall represent a default and breach under this chapter and a
franchise grant:



      (1)   If a grantee should default in the performance of any of
its material obligations under this chapter or under such documents,
agreements, and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the
grantor and a grantee;



      (2)   If a grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full
force and effect, the liability and indemnification coverages or the security
fund or bonds as required herein;



      (3)   If any court of competent jurisdiction, or any federal
or state regulatory body by rules, decisions or other action determines that
any material provision of a franchise documents, including this chapter, is
invalid or unenforceable prior to the commencement of system construction;



      (4)   If a grantee should willfully violate any orders or
rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over a grantee relative to
a franchise unless such orders or rulings are being contested by a grantee in
a court of competent jurisdiction;



      (5)   If a grantee ceases to provide services for any reason
within the control of the grantee over a telecommunications system, grantee
shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this chapter in any case in which performance of any such
provision is prevented for reasons beyond a grantee’s control. A fault
shall not be deemed to be beyond a grantee’s control if committed by a
corporation or other business entity in which a grantee holds a controlling
interest, whether held directly or indirectly;



      (6)   If a grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of
this chapter, FCC rules, a franchise agreement, or practices any fraud or
deceit upon the grantor;



      (7)   If a grantee’s construction schedule is delayed for
more than 12 months later than the schedule contained in a franchise
agreement and after due process, the grantor finds the delay was not
excusable; and/or



      (8)   If a grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to
pay its debts, or is adjudged as bankrupt.



   (B)   Procedure prior to revocations.



      (1)   The grantor may make written demand that a grantee
comply with any requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule, or regulation
or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal,
or neglect of a grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such
written demand, the grantor may immediately initiate franchise revocation
procedures and shall cause notice of such action to be served upon a grantee,
at least ten days prior to the date of a franchise revocation hearing, a
written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and
place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published at least once, ten
days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within a
franchise area.



      (2)   The grantor shall hear any persons interested therein,
and shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal,
or neglect by a grantee was with just cause.



      (3)   If such failure, refusal, or neglect by a grantee was
with just cause, the grantor shall direct a grantee to comply within such
time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.



      (4)   If the grantor shall determine such failure, refusal, or
neglect by a grantee was without just cause, then the grantor may, by
resolution, declare that franchise awarded hereunder to such grantee shall be
terminated and security fund and bonds forfeited unless there be compliance
by a grantee within such period as the grantor may fix or as established
within a franchise.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.100)



§ 114.070  PROCEDURES/TERMINATION OF EXPIRATION.



   (A)   Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires,
is revoked, or otherwise terminated, the grantor may order the removal of the
system facilities from a franchise area within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the grantor, or require the original grantee to maintain and
operate its system until a subsequent grantee is selected and a subsequent or
modified telecommunications system becomes operational.



   (B)   Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures,
and equipment a grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that
shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to a grantee’s removal of its equipment
and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires, or
attachments. The grantor shall inspect and approve the condition of the
public ways and public places, and cables, wires, attachments and poles after
removal. The liability, indemnity, and insurance, and the security fund and
bonds provided therein, shall continue in full force and effect during the
period of removal and until full compliance by a grantee with the terms and
conditions of this section.



   (C)   Restoration by grantor; reimbursement of costs. In the event
of a failure by a grantee to complete any work required by division (A) above
and/or division (B) above, or any other work required by the grantor or a
franchise awarded hereunder, the grantor may cause such work to be done and a
grantee shall reimburse the grantor the cost thereof within 30 days after
receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the grantor may recover such
costs through the security fund or bonds provided by grantee. The grantor
shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.



   (D)   Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation
of a franchise, the grantor may require a grantee to continue to operate the
cable communications system for a defined period of time not to exceed 24
months from the date of such expiration or revocation. A grantee shall, as
trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable
communications system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and a
franchise agreement and to provide the regular user services and any and all
of the services that may be provided at that time. The grantor shall be
permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of
this section.



   (E)   Grantor’s right not affected. The termination and forfeiture
of any franchise shall in no way affect any of the rights of the grantor
under a franchise awarded hereunder or any provision of law.



(2011 Code, § 14.08.110)



§ 114.071  RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.



   (A)   Any franchise awarded hereunder, at the option of the grantor,
shall cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or
receivers to trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of a
grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other
action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:



      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days
after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this chapter and a franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the
receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all defaults
under a franchise awarded hereunder; and



      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days,
execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by
each and every term, provision, and limitation of a franchise herein granted.



   (B)   In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the
system, plant, property, and equipment of a grantee, or any part thereof,
including or excluding a franchise, the grantor may serve notice of
termination upon a grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which
event a franchise herein granted and all rights and privileges of a grantee
hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice,
unless:



      (1)   The grantor shall have approved the transfer of a
franchise awarded hereunder, as and in the manner in this chapter provided;
and



      (2)   Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed
with the grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of a
franchise awarded hereunder.

(2011 Code, § 14.12.030)



§ 114.088  RESERVATION BY GRANTOR.



   The grantor reserves the right, at its discretion, from time to time,
to determine if the entity described in § 114.087 is performing its purpose
in a manner satisfactory to the grantor, and if it is not, the grantor may
receive and reallocate all or a portion of the system’s capacity,
operations appropriation, and capital appropriation, including any facilities
and equipment purchased previously with such appropriation, to another

(2011 Code, § 14.12.050)



§ 114.090  RATE CHANGE PROCEDURE.



   (A)   A grantee subject to provisions of this chapter may not
increase any rate or charge for any of its services without first filing
notice of such proposed increased rate or charge with the grantor clerk and
all affected system users. Such advance notice of a proposed change in user
fees shall be subject to provision’s of a grantor’s rate regulation
ordinance(s) which ordinance(s) and provisions by this reference shall be
considered fully set forth herein.



   (B)   A grantee subject to provisions of this chapter may not

notice shall state the nature of the increase or modification and provide the
reason such increase or modification is deemed necessary by the grantor.



   (C)   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions (A) and (B) above,
a grantee and the grantor recognize that cable television tier I services, as
defined within a franchise agreement, shall provide information vital to the
community through the use of dedicated channels providing governmental,

this chapter and franchise awarded hereunder shall not modify or repackage
its cable television tier I programming services without the advance approval
of the grantor or as otherwise provided within a franchise.



   (D)   Notwithstanding that certain rates and charges for a
grantor’s services may be exempt from grantor regulation at the time of
adoption of this chapter, the grantor herein expressly reserves the right to
revise this chapter in the future to incorporate any additional rate or
service regulatory rights that may result from future changes in federal or
state law and/or FCC rules and regulations.



   (E)   Any cable television franchise awarded hereunder may provide a
procedure by which a grantee may request a modification of cable television
programming services within a tier I, or for an increase or modification of
any rate charge or service not subject to provisions of a grantor’s cable
television rate regulation ordinance. Such a procedure may provide that:



      (1)   The grantor may, by affirmative action by its
legislative body, require a grantee to appear before it to show cause
pursuant to criteria hereinafter set out as to why the grantor’s rates,
charges, or services should be increased or modified;



      (2)   If the grantor should so act, the grantor clerk shall be
required to give notice of said hearing to grantee not less than 30 days
prior to the scheduled date for said hearing; and



      (3)   In the event the grantor shall determine that such a
hearing should take place, then said hearing shall be conducted in the
following manner:

shall be the grantor’s responsibility to determine whether or not a grantee
has established reasonable rates or services for subscribers and if such
proposed increase or modification of rates or services are reasonable or
lawful. In making such determination, the grantor shall consider and give due
weight to a grantee’s expenses, a reasonable grantee return on the cost of
the property used in this service, depreciation, obsolescence, taxes, risks
of the business, and the value of service to the customer. A copy of such
decision will be served upon a grantee.



   (F)   If, after the hearing, the grantor finds existing rates to be
unjust, unreasonable, or in violation of the law, a copy of such decision
along with its conclusions and findings supporting its decision will be
served upon a grantee.

be borne by a grantee.

   (A)   At the grantor’s sole option, within 90 days of the first
anniversary of the effective date of each franchise, and each year thereafter
throughout the term of a franchise awarded hereunder, the grantor and the
grantee shall meet publicly to review the performance, quality of service,
and rates of a telecommunications system. The reports required in §§
114.150 through 114.161 regarding user complaints, the records of performance
tests, and the opinion survey report shall be utilized as the basis for
review. In addition, any user may submit complaints during the review
meetings, either orally or in writing, and these shall be considered.



   (B)   Within 30 days after the conclusion of system performance
review meetings, the grantor shall issue findings with respect to the
adequacy of system performance and quality of service. If inadequacies are
found, the grantor shall direct a grantee to correct the inadequacies within
a reasonable period of time.



   (C)   Failure of a grantee, after due notice, to correct the
inadequacies shall be considered a material breach of a franchise awarded
hereunder and the grantor may, at its sole discretion, exercise any remedy
within the scope of this chapter considered by the grantor to be appropriate.

to achieve a continuing, advanced modern system, the grantor and a grantee
shall comply with the following system and services review provisions.



   (A)   At the grantor’s sole option, the grantor and a grantee
shall hold a performance and compliance system and services audit session on

shall submit a report to the grantor indicating the following:



      (1)   All system services that are being provided on an
operational basis, excluding tests and demonstrations, to other
municipalities within the United States with populations above 50,000 that
are not provided to the grantor; and



      (2)   A plan for provision of such services, or a
justification indicating why such services are not feasible for the
grantor’s franchise area.



   (C)   Topics for discussion and review at the system and services
audit sessions shall include, but shall not be limited to, services provided,
rate structure, free or discounted services, application of new technologies,
system performance, programming, users’ complaints, rights of privacy,
amendments to a franchise awarded hereunder, construction processes,
developments in the law, and regulatory constraints.



   (D)   Either the grantor or a grantee may select additional topics
for discussion at any review session.



   (E)   Not later than 60 days after the conclusion of each system and
services audit, the grantor shall issue findings, including specifically a
listing of any services not then being provided to the grantor, that are
considered technically and economically feasible.



(2011 Code, § 14.12.080)



§ 114.093  PUBLIC BENEFIT CAPACITY MANAGEMENT.



   (A)   Intent. It is the intent of the grantor to ensure that,

agreement shall be managed in the best public interest so that such services
will be free of censorship, open to all residents, and available for all
forms of public expression, community information, and debate of public
issues. Pursuant to these objectives, the grantor may delegate the
responsibility for public benefit capability management to a nonprofit
entity, which may include, but not be limited to, any of the following: a
nonprofit corporation; a management commission or committee, appointed by the
grantor, and representing a broad spectrum of the community; and/or an
established nonprofit entity with special capability, such as a local or
regional school system or community college.



   (B)   Functions. The entity designated to manage public benefit
capability shall have the following functions:



      (1)   Responsibility for public benefit usage and management
as may be required within a franchise;

to renew the franchise, a grantee shall act so as to ensure that all system
users receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the
circumstances. In the event of a change of franchise, or in the event a new
operator acquires the system, a grantee shall cooperate with the grantor, new
franchisee, or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all system
users. During such period, a grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for

to fulfill this obligation for a grantee, a grantee shall reimburse the
grantor for all costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system
received by the grantor that are the result of a grantee’s failure to
perform.

a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals
under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property

determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes
flight upon appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or
herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any
object.  Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it
impractical, a police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under

would otherwise be warranted, by requesting the person to identify himself or
herself and to explain his or her presence or conduct.  No person shall be
convicted of an offense under this section if the police officer did not
comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the
explanation given by the person was true and, if it had been believed by the
police officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.  Any police

without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay in arresting the
suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the suspect’s escape.

thereto, the Health Officer shall give notice in writing to the operator of
such rooming house that unless such conditions or practices are corrected
within a reasonable period, to be determined by the Health Officer, the
operator’s rooming house permit will be suspended. At the end of such
period, the Health Officer shall re-inspect such rooming house and, if he or
she finds such conditions or practices have not been corrected, he or she
shall give notice in writing to the operator that the latter’s permit has
been suspended. Upon receipt of notice of suspension, such operator shall
immediately cease operation of such rooming house, and no person shall occupy
for sleeping or living purposes any rooming unit therein.



   (D)   Any person whose permit to operate a rooming house has been
suspended, or who has received notice from the Health Officer that his or her

required number of water closets. All such facilities shall be so located
within the dwelling as to be reasonably accessible from a common hall or
passageway to all persons sharing facilities. Every lavatory basin and

facilities shall be located in a basement except by written approval of the
Health Officer.



   (F)   The operator of every rooming house shall change supplied bed

§ 152.15  CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE FOR RENTAL PROPERTIES.



   (A)   No owner, agent, or person in charge of a dwelling or dwelling
unit shall allow any person to occupy the same as a tenant or lessee or for a
valuable consideration unless said dwelling or dwelling unit has been
inspected as of the first change in occupancy after the effective date of the
ordinance codified herein and thereafter as of the first occupancy after a
change in ownership of every or every 24 months, whichever occurs first and
determined to be in compliance with all of the applicable provisions of §§
152.01 through 152.14, 152.17, and 152.99, as amended from time to time, and
the applicable provisions of Chapter 154 of this code, as amended from time
to time (hereinafter referred to in this section as “minimum housing
standards”) as evidenced by a certificate of compliance issued by the
Housing Inspector as provided in this section.



   (B)   Upon request of the owner, agent, or other person authorized
to rent a dwelling or dwelling unit (hereinafter referred to in this section
as the “applicant”) and payment of the inspection fee, the Housing
Inspector will be available at an appointed time within 48 hours agreed upon
by himself or herself and the applicant, or later, if the applicant requests,
to inspect such dwelling or dwelling unit. If such inspection establishes
that the dwelling or dwelling unit complies with all of the minimum housing
standards, he or she shall issue a certificate of compliance for said
dwelling or dwelling unit, indicating the maximum number of occupants who may
lawfully occupy it under the provisions in compliance with the minimum
housing standards. One copy of the certificate shall be handed to or mailed
to the applicant and a second copy for the information of the tenant or
lessee shall be posted by the Housing Inspector on the inside of the main
entrance door of the certified premises or in a conspicuous place nearby and
shall not be removed by, or at the direction of, anyone other than the tenant.



   (C)   If said dwelling or dwelling unit does not comply with the
minimum housing standards, the Housing Inspector shall furnish the applicant
with a written list of the specific violations of this code which would have
to be corrected before a certificate of compliance or a list of violations,
as above provided.



   (D)   No applicant, tenant, or occupant shall permit the occupancy
of any dwelling or dwelling unit by a greater number of persons than that
specified in the certificate of compliance.



   (E)   Any applicant who is delayed in correcting violations
necessary to entitle him or her to a certificate of compliance and who has a
valid contract in writing with a qualified person for the performance of work
and the furnishing of the materials to correct such violation, may petition
the Health Officer in writing for a temporary waiver of compliance. No fees
shall be required. The petition shall be on a form provided by the Housing
Appeals Officer and shall contain the information therein requested and
reasonably necessary to his or her decision, and shall include a written and
signed statement by the person under contract to correct the violation,
specifying the anticipated date of beginning and completion of the work. If,
after the hearing, the Housing Appeals Officer finds that the delay in the
correction of the violation is reasonable, taking into consideration the
availability of qualified persons to do the work and the current work load,
and the work can reasonably be undertaken and completed while the premises
are occupied or that appropriate provision has been made for housing the
tenant elsewhere during the necessary period when the dwelling or dwelling
unit will not be habitable because of the work of correcting the code
violation, the Health Officer shall issue a temporary waiver of compliance
expiring on the date when the corrective work should be completed. Applicant
shall, on or before said date, request a re-inspection and pay the
re-inspection fee. The Housing Inspector shall re-inspect the dwelling or
dwelling unit and issue the certificate of compliance or list any remaining
violations, as above provided.



   (F)   Any applicant who deems himself or herself aggrieved by the
decision of the Health Officer may, by written request to the Housing Appeal
Board and without the payment of a fee, have the entire matter heard by it on
his or her original petition. After hearing the applicant, his or her
witnesses, his or her counsel (if any), the Health Officer or his or her
designate and any witnesses he or she may produce, and his or her counsel (if
any), the Housing Appeal Board shall, if it finds the existence of all the
required prerequisites to the granting of a temporary waiver of compliance by
the Health Officer, direct him or her to issue such a waiver.



   (G)   The fees for inspections under this section shall be
determined by resolution of the City Council.



   (H)   The inspections provided for in this section shall not be
mandatory until January 1, 1975.



   (I)   The Housing Inspector shall maintain a registry of rental
property owners and premises.



   (J)   The owners of rental dwellings and dwelling units shall
register their names and places of residence or usual places of business and
the location of the premises regulated by this section with the Housing
Inspector or his or her designate. The registrations provided for in this
division (J) shall be made prior to January 1, 1975.



   (K)   If the premises are managed or operated by an agent, the
agent’s name and place of business shall be placed with the name of the
owner in the registry.

§ 152.16  CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE FOR SINGLE-FAMILY, OWNER-OCCUPIED
DWELLINGS.



   (A)   (1)   No single-family dwellings shall be sold to another
who intends to occupy the same unless the seller shall transfer to the buyer
a valid certificate of compliance issued by the Housing Inspector certifying
that said dwelling complies with applicable provisions of this chapter, as
amended from time to time, and the applicable provisions of Chapter 154 of
this code, as amended from time to time. The certificate of compliance herein
provided for shall have been obtained by the seller within six months prior
to the date of sale. In the event the seller does not have a valid
certificate of compliance, he or she shall so inform the buyer. The transfer
of a valid certificate of compliance herein provided for may be waived by
mutual agreement of the parties; provided, that such waiver is accompanied by
a list of existing violations prepared and signed by the Housing Inspector
and dated not more than six months prior to the date of sale. The notice of
violations shall be attached to and made a part of the waiver of certificate
of compliance herein provided for. Such a waiver shall be in writing and
shall be in the following form:



 


WAIVER OF CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE


NOTICE: DO NOT SIGN IN BLANK. DO NOT SIGN WITHOUT READING

 

  (Name of seller)  proposes to sell certain real estate located at  
(street address)  and described more particularly as follows:     
(insert legal description) and (name of buyer) proposes to purchase the same.

 

  (Name of seller)  is unable to transfer to   (name of buyer)  a valid
certificate of compliance as required by Section XIX of the Linden Housing
and Rental Ordinance (§ 152.16 of the Linden City Code).

 

Therefore, it is understood that the seller’s liability to so transfer a
valid certificate of compliance means that the property proposed to be sold
is not in compliance with the Linden Housing and Rental Ordinance (Chapter
152 of the Linden City Code) and contains defects which must be corrected,
such defects being listed on the notice of violation attached hereto.

 

It is further understood that the buyer in signing the waiver acknowledges
the fact that the property to be purchased by him is in violation of the
Linden Housing and Rental Ordinance (Chapter 152 of the Linden City Code) and
contains certain defects which must be corrected and that in the event a sale
is consummated, the buyer will be required to correct said defects and will
be subject to the fines and penalties provided in the Linden Housing and
Rental Ordinance (Chapter 152 of the Linden City Code) for failure to do so
unless a variance is obtained. It is also understood that the occupancy of
the premises by the buyer without correction of the defects or obtaining the
necessary variance is a violation of the Linden Housing and Rental Ordinance
(Chapter 152 of the Linden City Code) and subjects the buyer to the fines and
penalties therein provided.

 

It is finally understood and agreed that the parties do hereby waive the
transfer of a valid certificate of compliance by the seller to the buyer as
required by the Linden Housing and Rental Ordinance (Chapter 152 of the
Linden City Code).

parties, shall be returned to said office for filing following consummation
of the sale.



   (B)   Upon request of the owner, agent, or other person authorized
to sell such a dwelling (hereinafter referred to in this section as the
“applicant”) and payment of the inspection fee, the Housing Inspector
will be available at an appointed time within 48 hours agreed upon by himself
or herself and the applicant, or later, if the applicant requests, to inspect
such dwelling. If such inspection establishes that the dwelling complies with
all of the minimum housing standards, he or she shall issue a certificate of
compliance for said dwelling.



   (C)   If said dwelling does not comply with said minimum housing
standards, the Housing Inspector shall furnish the applicant with a written
list of the specific violations of this code which would have to be corrected
before a certificate of compliance may be issued or a list of violations, as
above provided.



   (D)   Any applicant who is delayed in correcting violations
necessary to entitle him or her to a certificate of compliance may petition
the Health Officer in writing for temporary waiver of compliance. No fees
shall be required. The petition shall be on a form provided by the Health
Officer and shall contain the information therein requested and reasonably
necessary to his or her decision, and shall include a written and signed
statement by the person under contract to correct the violation, specifying
the anticipated date of beginning and completion of the work. If, after the
hearing, the Health Officer finds that the delay in the correction of the
violation is reasonable, taking into consideration the availability of
qualified persons to do the work and the current work load, and the work can
reasonably be undertaken and completed while the premises are occupied or
that appropriate provision has been made for housing the tenant elsewhere
during the necessary period when the dwelling or dwelling unit will not be
habitable because of the work of correcting the code violation, the Health
Officer shall issue a temporary waiver of compliance expiring on the date
when the corrective work should be completed. The applicant shall, on or
before said date, request a re-inspection and pay the re-inspection fee. The
Housing Inspector shall re-inspect the dwelling or dwelling unit and issue
the certificate of compliance or list any remaining violations, as above
provided.

decision of the Health Officer on his or her appeal may, by written request
to the Housing Appeal Board and without the payment of a fee, have the entire
matter heard by it on his or her original petition. After hearing the
applicant, his or her witnesses, his or her counsel (if any), the Health
Officer or his or her designate and any witnesses he or she may produce, and
his or her counsel (if any), the Housing Appeal Board shall, if it finds the
existence of all the required prerequisites to the granting of a temporary
waiver of compliance by the Health Officer, direct him or her to issue such a
waiver.



   (F)   The fees for inspections under this section shall be

nuisance exists, who has been guilty of such violation or of creating or
permitting the existence of such nuisance, and any person who violates or
assists in violating any provision of this chapter shall also jointly and
severally for each such violation and each such nuisance be subject to a
civil penalty of $50 to be recovered for the use of the Health Department in
civil action brought in the name of the city by the Health Officer or by such
other appropriate public official as the Mayor may designate. Such persons
shall also be liable for all costs, expenses, and disbursements paid or
incurred by the Health Department, by any of the officers thereof or by an
agent, employee, or contractor of the same, in the removal of any such
nuisance or violation. Any person who, having been served with a notice or
order to remove any such nuisance or violation, shall fail to comply with
said notice or order within five days after such service or shall continue to
violate any provision or requirement of this chapter in the respect named in
said notice or order, shall also be subject to a civil penalty of $250. For
the recovery of any such penalties, costs, expenses, or disbursements, an
action may be brought in the circuit court for the county or any court of
competent civil jurisdiction. In case the owner, lessee, or other person
having control of such dwelling does not reside within the state or cannot,
after diligent effort, be served with process therein, the same being duly
made to appear to satisfaction of the court, an order may be entered by the
court for the publication of notice to the owner not served in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the county once each week for two successive
weeks, requiring such owner to appear and defend such suit, if he or she
desires, within one week after the last publication of such notice, and upon
filing due proof of the publication of such notice, such action may proceed
in or against the dwelling or structure upon the same lot with the dwelling,
and the lot involved, and in person against any other person duly served in
said proceeding, if there be such person. The existence of a nuisance in or
upon such dwelling structure on the same lot with a dwelling or on such lot,
which the owner thereof has created or permitted to exist, and any violation
of this chapter as to such dwelling structure and lot of which the owner has
been guilty shall in such proceeding subject such dwelling structure and lot
respectively, to a penalty of $50 which shall be a lien thereon until paid,
and any violation of an order made or a notice given by the Health Officer
permitted or committed by the owner of a dwelling structure on the same lot
with a dwelling on such lot, shall in such proceeding subject the dwelling
structure and lot respectively to a penalty of $250, which penalty shall be a
lien thereon until paid.



   (B)   Whenever any person has been found guilty, after the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, in connection with any
dwelling in which the person is not residing, and the person has failed to
correct the violation within 90 days after having been found guilty, and
after a final determination of guilt, the City Council may correct or cause
to be corrected any violation upon which the person has been found guilty and
the costs of such repairs shall be paid by such person within 90 days or such
costs shall become a lien upon the real property; and in the case that the
dwelling is one in which the person has not resided for a period of six
months, and there has been no other occupancy for such period, the City
Council shall have the option of repairing the property or removing such
property, and the costs of such removal or repair shall be paid by such
person within 30 days or such costs shall become a lien upon the real
property. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the term
DWELLING, for the purpose of this chapter is defined as residential real
property. The liens shall be enforced in the manner prescribed in the charter
or by the laws of this state providing for the enforcement of tax liens or by
an ordinance passed by the City Council.



   (C)   Except as otherwise specified in this section, the procedure
for the prevention of violation of this chapter or for the vacation of
premises unlawfully occupied or for other abatement of nuisance in connection
with a dwelling, shall be in accordance with the existing practice and
procedure. In case any dwelling, building, or structure is constructed,
altered, converted, or maintained in violation of any provision of this
chapter or of any order or notice of the Health Officer or such other
appropriate public official as the Mayor may designate, or in the case a
nuisance exists in any such dwelling, building, or structure or upon the lot
on which it is situated, the Health Officer or such other appropriate public
official as the Mayor may designate, may institute any appropriate action or
proceeding to prevent such lawful construction, alteration, conversion, or
maintenance, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation or nuisance, to
prevent the occupation of said dwelling, building, or structure, or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, or proceeding the Health Officer may by a
petition of complaint, duly verified, setting forth the facts, apply to the
circuit court for the county, or to any judge thereof, for an order granting
the relief for which the action on proceeding is brought, or for an order
enjoining all persons from doing or permitting to be done any work in or
about such dwelling, building, structure, or lot, or from occupying or using
the same for any purpose until the entry of final judgment or order. In case
any notice or order issued by said Health Officer or such other appropriate
public official as the Mayor may designate, is not complied with, the Health
Officer may apply to the circuit court or to any judge thereof for an order
authorizing him or her to execute and carry out the provisions of said notice
or order, or to abate any nuisance in or about such dwelling, building, or
structure or the lot upon which it is situated. In no case shall the Health
Department, Health Officer, or such other appropriate public official as the
Mayor may designate, or any officer or employee thereof of the city, be
liable for the costs in any action or proceeding that may be commenced in
pursuance of this chapter. The actions, proceeding, and authority of the
Health Officer shall at all times be treated as prima facie just and legal.



   (D)   If the occupant of a dwelling fails to comply with the
provisions of this chapter after due and proper notice from the Health
Officer, such failure to comply shall be deemed sufficient cause for the
summary eviction of such tenant by the owner and the cancellation of his or
her lease.



   (E)   Every fine or penalty imposed by judgment upon the owner of a
dwelling or of a structure on the same lot with a dwelling, or of a lot,
shall be a lien upon the real property in relation to which the penalty is
imposed from the time of the recording of a certified copy of the judgment in
the office of the Registrar of Deeds of the county in which said dwelling is
situated, subject only to taxes, assessments, and water rates and to such
mortgage and mechanics’ liens as may exist thereon prior to such recording.
The Health Officer or such other appropriate public official as the Mayor may
designate, upon the entry of the judgment, shall record a copy, and such copy
upon recording shall be indexed by the Registrar of Deeds in the index of
mechanics’ liens.



   (F)   If any civil action or proceeding instituted by the Health
Officer and plaintiff or petitioner may record in the office of the Registrar
of Deeds of the county where the property is affected by such action or
proceeding is situated a notice of the pendency of such action or proceeding.
The notice may be recorded at the time of the commencement of the action or
proceeding, or at any time afterwards before final judgment or order, or at
any time after the service of any notice or order issued by the Health
Officer or by such other appropriate public official as the Mayor may
designate. Such notice shall have the same force and effect as the notice of
pendency of action affecting real estate. Each Registrar of Deeds with whom
such notice is recorded shall index it to the name of each person specified
in a direction subscribed by the City Attorney. Any such notice may be
vacated upon the order of a judge of the court in which such action or
proceeding was instituted or is pending, or upon the consent in writing of
the City Attorney. The Registrar of Deeds of the county where such notice is
recorded, upon the presentation and recording of such consent or of a
certified copy of such order, shall proceed in the same manner as is provided
by law for processing a real estate mortgage discharge.

as historic by the Historic District Commission the same as older, existing
district resources.



   NOTICE TO PROCEED. The written permission to issue a permit for work
that is inappropriate and that adversely affects a resource pursuant to a
finding under § 153.04(G).



   ORDINARY MAINTENANCE. Keeping a resource unimpaired and in good
condition through ongoing minor intervention, undertaken from time to time,
in its exterior condition. ORDINARY MAINTENANCE does not change the external
appearance of the resource except through the elimination of the usual and

(2011 Code, § 15.12.030)  (Ord. 95 passed - -1978)



§ 153.04  PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF PLANS.



   (A)   As required by Chapter 154 of this code, as amended,
application for a building permit to construct, alter, repair, move, or
demolish any structure must be made to the Building Inspector. Plans shall be
submitted showing the structure in question and also showing its relation to
adjacent structures, if the structure in question is in the Historic
District. Upon the filing of such application, the Building Inspector shall
immediately notify the Commission of receipt of such application and shall
transmit it together with accompanying plans and other information to the
Commission immediately.



   (B)   The Commission shall meet within 60 days after notification by
the Building Inspector of the filing, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon
by the applicant and Commission, and shall review the plans according to the
duties and powers specified herein. In reviewing the plans, the Commission
may confer with the applicant for the building permit.



   (C)   The Commission shall approve or disapprove such plans and, if
approved, shall issue a certificate of appropriateness, which is to be signed
by the Chairperson, attached to the application for a building permit and
immediately transmitted to the Building Inspector. The Chairperson shall also
stamp all prints submitted to the Commission signifying its approval.



   (D)   If the Commission disapproved of such plans, it shall state
its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and
reasons therefor in writing to the Building Inspector and to the applicant.
The Commission must advise what it thinks is proper if it disapproved of the
plans submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make
modifications to his or her plans and shall have the right to resubmit his or
her application at any time after so doing, or may elect to begin the appeals
process as outlined in division (E) below. The failure of the Commission to
approve or disapprove of such plans within 60 days from the date of
application for the building permit, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by
the applicant and the Commission, shall be deemed to constitute approval and
the Building Inspector shall proceed to process the application without
regard to a certificate of appropriateness.



   (E)   The Commission shall file certificates of appropriateness and
denials of application for permits with the Building Inspector. A permit
shall not be issued until the Commission has acted as prescribed by this
chapter. If a permit application is denied, the decision shall be binding on
the Building Inspector. A denial shall be accompanied by a written
explanation by the Commission of the reasons for the denial, and, if
appropriate, a notice that an application may be resubmitted for Commission
review and suggested changes have been made. The denial shall advise the
applicant of his or her rights to appeal within 60 days to the State Historic
Preservation Review Board and to the circuit court in the county.



   (F)   If an application is for work that will adversely affect the
exterior of a resource the Commission considers valuable to the city, state,
or the United States of America, and the Commission determines that the
alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose
of the city, state, or the United States of America, the Commission shall
attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible
plan for preservation of the resource.



   (G)   Work within a historic district shall be permitted through the
issuance of a notice to proceed by the Commission if any to the following
conditions prevail or if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a finding
of the Commission to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of
the following conditions:



      (1)   The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the
public or to the structures occupants;



      (2)   The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement
program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the
applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning
approvals, financing and environmental clearances;



      (3)   Retaining the resource will cause undue financial
hardship when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond
the owner’s control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to
eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for
sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within
the Historic District, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner; and/or



      (4)   Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the
majority of the community.



(2011 Code, § 15.12.040)  (Ord. 193, passed - -1992)  Penalty, see §
153.99



§ 153.05  DEMOLITION OR MOVING OF HISTORIC STRUCTURE.



   (A)   The demolition or moving of structures or objects of historic
or architectural worth shall be discouraged and avoided if alternate
solutions can be found. The Commission may issue a notice to proceed for
demolition or for moving a structure but shall be guided by the conditions
set forth in § 153.04(G) in exercising its judgment in granting such a
notice:



      (1)   The Building Inspector deems such structure to be a
hazard to public safety or health and repairs are impossible;



      (2)   Such a structure is a deterrent to a major improvement
program which will be of substantial benefit to the community;



      (3)   Retention of such a structure would cause undue
financial hardship to the owner, which would be defined as a situation where
more funds than is reasonable would be required to retain the structure;
and/or



      (4)   The retention of such structure would not be in the
interest of the community as a whole.



   (B)   In division (A) above, if approval for demolition is granted,
such notice shall not become effective until 90 days after the date of such
issuance in order to provide a period of time within which it may be possible
to relieve a hardship or to cause the property to be transferred to another
owner who will retain the structure. This period of time may be increased or
decreased if mutually agreed upon by both the petitioner and the Commission.



(2011 Code, § 15.12.050)



§ 153.06  YARD VARIANCE.



   Due to peculiar conditions of design and constructions in historic
neighborhoods where structures were often built close to lot lines, it is in
the public interest to retain a neighborhood’s historic appearance by
making variances to normal yard requirements. Where it is deemed that such
variances will not adversely affect neighboring properties, the Commission
may recommend to the Zoning Board of Appeals that such variances to standard
yard requirements be made.



(2011 Code, § 15.12.060)  (Ord. 193, passed - -1992)



§ 153.07  ACCEPTANCE OF GIFT OR GRANT.



   (A)   The Council may accept grants from the state or federal
government for historic restoration purposes; it may accept public or private
gifts for historic purposes; and may appoint the Historic District Commission
to administer on its behalf the grants and gifts for the purposes herein
provided.



   (B)   The City Treasurer shall be custodian of the funds of the
Historic District Commission and authorized expenditures shall be certified
to the City Manager by the Secretary or other officer designated by the
Historic District Commission.



   (C)   The Commission shall annually report to the Council any money
it shall receive or expend.



(2011 Code, § 15.12.070)



§ 153.08  EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary
maintenance or repair of any structure within the Historic District; nor
shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent the construction,
alteration, repair, moving, or demolition of any structure under a permit
issued by the Building Inspector prior to the passage of the chapter.
Exceptions to strict construction of the provisions of this chapter may be
granted only by resolution of the City Council.



   (B)   Deliberate or irresponsible neglect of a historic structure
resulting in serious physical deterioration or health and safety hazards
shall constitute demolition by neglect and shall be a violation of this
chapter. Upon the finding by the Commission that a historic resource within a
historic district or proposed historic district such to the Commission’s
review and approval is threatened with demolition by neglect, the Commission
may do either the following:



      (1)   Require the owner of the resource to repair all
conditions contributing to demolition by neglect; or



      (2)   If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable
time, the Commission or its agents may enter the property and make such
repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The cost of the
work shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by the local unit as a
special assessment against the property. The Commission may enter the
property for purposes of this section upon obtaining an order from the
circuit court.

§ 153.09  ELIMINATION OF A HISTORIC DISTRICT.



   (A)   Before establishing, modifying, or eliminating a historic
district, a Historic District Study Committee appointed by the City Council
shall, except in considering the elimination of a historic district, comply
with the procedures set forth in § 153.03 and shall consider any previously
written Committee reports pertinent to the proposed action.



   (B)   If the Commission has made a determination to eliminate a
historic district, a Committee shall follow the procedure set forth in §
153.04 for issuing a preliminary report, holding a public hearing, and
issuing a final report but with the intent of showing one or more of the
following:



      (1)   The historic district has lost those physical
characteristics that enabled establishment of the district;



      (2)   The historic district was not significant in the way
previously defined; and/or



      (3)   The historic district was established pursuant to
defective procedures.

restrictive shall govern.



   (D)   Nothing within this chapter shall be construed to prevent

proposed development so warrant.



   (F)   Amendment of approved site plan. The Zoning Administrator
shall have the authority to determine if a proposed change requires an
amendment to an approved final site plan. A site plan may be amended upon
application and in accordance with the procedure herein for a final site
plan. The Zoning Administrator may approve minor changes in an approved final
site plan, provided that a revised final site plan drawing(s) be submitted
showing such minor changes, for purposes of record.

final site plan shall be submitted for review and approval for each phase.



   (I)   Inspection.



      (1)   The Building Inspector or the city’s designee shall be

final site plan. All sub-grade improvements such as utilities, sub-base
installations for drives and parking lots, and similar improvements shall be
inspected and approved prior to covering. The applicant shall be responsible
for requesting the necessary inspections. Prior to final site plan acceptance
by the city, the site plan review checklist, approved by the Planning
Commission, must be completed by the appropriate city staff documenting
conformance with the final site plan.



      (2)   The Building Inspector/city’s designee shall notify
the Zoning Administrator, in writing, when a development for which a final
site plan is approved has passed inspection with respect to the approved
final site plan. The Building Inspector/city’s designee shall notify the
Zoning Administrator, in writing, of any development for which a final site
plan was approved, which does not pass inspection with respect to the
approved final site plan, and shall advise the Zoning Administrator of steps
taken to achieve compliance. In such case, the Building Inspector/city’s
designee shall periodically notify the Zoning Administrator of progress
towards compliance with the approved final site plan and when compliance is
achieved.

right to enter upon the subject property to make the improvements.



      (2)   If the performance guarantee is not sufficient to allow
the city to complete the improvements, the applicant shall be required to pay
the city all of the additional costs of completing the improvements. Should
the city use the performance guarantee, or a portion thereof, to complete the
required improvements, any amounts remaining after said completion shall be
applied first to the city’s administrative costs including, without
limitation, attorney fees, planning consultant fees, and engineering
consultant fees in completing the improvement with any balance remaining
being refunded to the applicant.



      (3)   If the applicant has been required to post a performance
guarantee or bond with another governmental agency other than the city to
ensure completion of an improvement, the applicant shall not be required to
deposit with the city a performance guarantee for that specific improvement.
At the time the performance guarantee is deposited with the city and prior to
the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall enter an agreement
incorporating the provisions hereof with the city regarding the performance
guarantee.

   The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and
expenses, and a collection procedure, for building permits, certificates of
occupancy, appeals, and other matters pertaining to this chapter. The city
shall have the authority to include fees for the use of engineering,
planning, legal, or other special consultants. The schedule of fees shall be
posted in the city offices, and may be altered or amended only by the City
Council. No permit or certificate shall be issued or special use site plan,
rezoning, or variance acted upon unless or until such costs, charges, fees,
or expenses have been paid in full.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)



§ 154.029  AMENDMENTS.



   (A)   Initiation of amendment. The City Council may, from time to
time, amend this chapter by changing or supplementing the district map, the
districts on said map, or the boundaries of such districts, district
regulations, or other provisions of this chapter. An amendment may be

or by the Planning Commission, and when requested by an interested party
shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount established by resolution of the
City Council.



   (B)   Amendment review procedure. The amendment and application
materials shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of this
section, and shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedure.
Amendments or application materials that do not meet the stipulated
requirements shall be considered incomplete and shall not be eligible for
consideration by the Planning Commission.



      (1)   Technical review. Prior to Planning Commission
consideration, the proposed amendment and application materials shall be
distributed to appropriate city staff and applicable outside agencies and
designated city consultants for review.



      (2)   Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held for all
proposed amendments in accordance with the procedures set forth in Public Act
110 of 2006, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.3 et seq., as amended.



      (3)   Planning Commission consideration. Subsequent to the
hearing, the Planning Commission shall review the proposed amendment,
together with any reports and recommendations from staff, consultants, other
reviewing agencies, and any public comments. The Planning Commission shall
identify and evaluate all factors relevant to the petition, including the
appropriate criteria listed in this section, and shall report its findings
and recommendation to the City Council.



      (4)   City Council action. Upon receipt of the report and
recommendation from the Planning Commission, the City Council shall consider
the proposed amendment. If determined to be necessary, the City Council may
refer the amendment back to the Planning Commission for further
consideration. In the case of an amendment to the official zoning map, the
City Council shall approve or deny the amendment, based upon its
consideration of the criteria contained in this section.



   (C)   Re-application. Whenever an application for an amendment to
this chapter has been denied by the City Council, a new application for the
same amendment shall not be accepted by the Planning Commission for
consideration for a period of 365 days, unless, upon recommendation by the
Zoning Administrator, the Planning Commission determines that one or more of
the following conditions has been met:



      (1)   There is a substantial change in circumstances relevant
to the issues or facts considered during review of the application that might
reasonably affect the decision-making body’s application of the relevant
review standards to the development proposed in the application;



      (2)   New or additional information is available that was not
available at the time of the review that might reasonably affect the
decision-making body’s application of the relevant review standards to the
development proposed; and/or



      (3)   The new application is materially different from the
prior application.



   (D)   Criteria for amendment of zoning district map.



      (1)   In considering any petition for an amendment to the
official zoning districts map, the Planning Commission and City Council shall
consider the following criteria in making its findings, recommendations, and
decision:



         (a)   Consistency with the goals, policies, and
objectives of the Master Plan and any sub-area plans. If conditions have
changed since the Master Plan was adopted, consistency with recent
development trends in the area shall be considered;



         (b)   Compatibility of the site’s physical,
geological, hydrological, and other environmental features with the uses
permitted in the proposed zoning district;



         (c)   Evidence the applicant cannot receive a reasonable
return on investment through developing the property with one or more of the
uses permitted under the current zoning;



         (d)   Compatibility of all the potential uses allowed in
the proposed zoning district with surrounding uses and zoning in terms of
land suitability, impacts on the environment, density, nature of use, traffic
impacts, aesthetics, infrastructure, and potential influence on property
values;



         (e)   The capacity of city’s utilities and services
sufficient to accommodate the uses permitted in the requested district
without compromising the health, safety, and welfare of the city;



         (f)   The capability of the street system to safely and
efficiently accommodate the expected traffic generated by uses permitted in
the requested zoning district; and



         (g)   The apparent demand for the types of uses
permitted in the requested zoning district in the city in relation to the
amount of land in the city currently zoned to accommodate the demand.



      (2)   Where a rezoning is reasonable given the above criteria,
a determination shall be made that the requested zoning district is more
appropriate than another district or amending the list of permitted or
special land uses within a district.



   (E)   Protests.



      (1)   Upon presentation of a protest petition meeting the
requirements of this division (E), an amendment to the zoning ordinance which
is the object of the petition shall be passed only by a two-thirds vote of
the City Council. The protest petition shall be presented to the City Council
before final Council action on the amendment, and shall meet signatory
requirements of divisions (E)(1)(a) or (E)(1)(b) below:



         (a)   The owners of at least 20% of the area of land
included in the proposed change; or



         (b)   The owners of at least 20% of the area of land
included within an area extending outward 100 feet from any point on the
boundary of the land in the proposed change.



      (2)   For the purposes of this division (E), publicly-owned
land shall be excluded in calculating the 20% land area requirement.



(Ord. 357, passed 6-8-2015)



§ 154.030  CONDITIONAL REZONING.



   (A)   Intent. It is recognized that there are certain instances
where it would be in the best interests of the city, as well as advantageous
to property owners seeking a change in zoning boundaries, if certain
conditions could be proposed by property owners as part of a request for a
rezoning. It is the intent of this section to provide a process consistent
with the provisions of § 405 of the Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of
2006, being M.C.L.A. § 125.3405, as amended, by which an owner seeking a
rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or
development of land as part of the rezoning request.



   (B)   Application and offer of conditions.



      (1)   An owner of land may voluntarily offer, in writing,
conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a
rezoning is requested. This offer may be made either at the time the
application for rezoning is filed or may be made at a later time during the
rezoning process.



      (2)   The required application and process for considering a
rezoning request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering
rezoning requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by
the requirements of this section.



      (3)   The owner’s offer of conditions may not purport to
authorize uses or developments not permitted in the requested new zoning
district.



      (4)   The owner’s offer of conditions shall bear a
reasonable and rational relationship to the property for which rezoning is
requested.



      (5)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of
conditions that would require a special land use permit under the terms of
this chapter may only be commenced if a special land use permit for such use
or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.



      (6)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of
conditions that would require a variance under the terms of this chapter may
only be commenced if a variance for such use or development is ultimately
granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.



      (7)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of
conditions that would require site plan approval under the terms of this
chapter may only be commenced if site plan approval for such use or
development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.



      (8)   The offer of conditions may be amended during the
process of rezoning consideration provided that any amended or additional
conditions are entered voluntarily by the owner. An owner may withdraw all or
part of its offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of
the City Council provided that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the
Planning Commission’s public hearing on the original rezoning request, then
the rezoning application shall be referred to the Planning Commission for a
new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation.



   (C)   Planning Commission review. The Planning Commission, after
public hearing and consideration of the standards for approval set forth in
division (E) below, may recommend approval, approval with recommended
changes, or denial of the rezoning; provided, however, that any recommended
changes to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered
by the owner.



   (D)   City Council review. After receipt of the Planning
Commission’s recommendation, the City Council shall deliberate upon the
requested rezoning and may approve or deny the conditional rezoning request.
The City Council’s deliberations shall include, but not be limited to, a
consideration of the standards for approval set forth in division (E) below.
Should the City Council consider amendments to the proposed conditional
rezoning advisable and if such contemplated amendments to the offer of
conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner, then the
City Council shall, in accordance with the State Zoning Enabling Act, being
M.C.L.A. § 125.3401, refer such amendments to the Planning Commission for a
report thereon within a time specified by the City Council and proceed
thereafter in accordance with said statute to deny or approve the conditional
rezoning with or without amendments.



   (E)   Factors. In reviewing an application for the rezoning or land
where there is an offer of conditions, factors that should be considered by
the Planning Commission and the City Council shall include the following:



      (1)   Whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the
goals, policies, and future land use map of the city’s Master Plan;



      (2)   The compatibility of all the potential uses allowed in
the proposed zoning district with surrounding land uses and zoning districts
in terms of land suitability, impacts on the environment, density, and
influence on property values;



      (3)   Whether any public services and facilities would be
significantly adversely impacted by a development or use allowed under the
requested rezoning. Consideration of impact on drains and roads is
specifically required; and



      (4)   Whether the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning
would be equally or better suited to the area than uses allowed under the
current zoning of the land.



   (F)   Approval.



      (1)   If the City Council finds the rezoning request and offer
of conditions acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a
formal written statement of conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming
in form to the provisions of this section. The statement of conditions shall
be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the
ordinance adopted by the City Council to accomplish the requested rezoning.



      (2)   The statement of conditions shall:



         (a)   Be in a form recordable with the Register of Deeds
of the county in which the subject land is located or, in the alternative, be
accompanied by a recordable affidavit or memorandum prepared and signed by
the owner giving notice of the statement of conditions in a manner acceptable
to the City Council;



         (b)   Contain a legal description of the land to which
it pertains;



         (c)   Contain a statement acknowledging that the
statement of conditions runs with the land and is binding upon successor
owners of the land;



         (d)   Incorporate by attachment or reference any
diagram, plans, or other documents submitted or approved by the owner that
are necessary to illustrate the implementation of the statement of
conditions. If any such documents are incorporated by reference, the
reference shall specify where the document may be examined;



         (e)   Contain a statement acknowledging that the
statement of conditions or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof
shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds of the county by the owner with
a copy of the recorded document provided to the city within 45 days of its
recording; and



         (f)   Contain the notarized signatures of all of the
owners of the subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that
they voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the
statement of conditions.



      (3)   Upon the rezoning taking effect, the zoning map shall be
amended to reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation
that the land was rezoned with a statement of conditions. The City Clerk
shall maintain a listing of all lands rezoned with a statement of conditions.



      (4)   The approved statement of conditions or an affidavit or
memorandum giving notice thereof shall be filed by the owner with the
Register of Deeds of the county. The owner shall provide a copy of the
recorded document to the city within 45 days of the date of its recording.
The City Council shall have authority to waive this requirement if it
determines that, given the nature of the conditions and/or the time frame
within which the conditions are to be satisfied, the recording of such a
document would be of no material benefit to the city or to any subsequent
owner of the land.



      (5)   Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so
rezoned shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating use
and development within the new zoning district as modified by any more
restrictive provisions contained in the statement of conditions.



   (G)   Compliance with conditions.



      (1)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a
use upon land that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously
operate and maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the
conditions set forth in the statement of conditions. Any failure to comply
with a condition contained within the statement of conditions shall
constitute a violation of this chapter and be punishable accordingly.
Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and
subject to judicial abatement as provided by law.



      (2)   No permit or approval shall be granted under this
chapter for any use or development that is contrary to an applicable
statement of conditions.



   (H)   Time period for establishing development or use. Unless
another time period is specified in the ordinance rezoning the subject land,
the approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and
other required permits must be commenced upon the land within 36 months after
the rezoning took effect and thereafter proceed diligently to completion.
This time limitation may, upon written request, be extended by the City
Council if:



      (1)   It is demonstrated to the City Council’s reasonable
satisfaction that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or
use will commence within the period of extension and proceed diligently
thereafter to completion;



      (2)   The City Council finds that there has not been a change
in circumstances that would render the current zoning with statement of
conditions incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or
otherwise inconsistent with sound zoning policy; and



      (3)   The written request shall be made to the City Council
requesting the extension within six months of the end of the 36-month period.



   (I)   Reversion of zoning. If approved development and/or use of the
rezoned land does not occur within the time frame specified under division
(H) above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as
set forth in M.C.L.A. § 125.3405(2). The reversion process shall be
initiated by the City Council requesting that the Planning Commission proceed
with consideration of rezoning of the land to its former zoning
classification. The procedure for considering and making this reversionary
rezoning shall thereafter be the same as applies to all other rezoning
requests.



   (J)   Subsequent rezoning of land. When land that is rezoned with a
statement of conditions is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning
classification or to the same zoning classification but with a different or
no statement of conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning
pursuant to division (I) above or otherwise, the statement of conditions
imposed under the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect.
Upon the owner’s written request, the City Clerk shall record with the
Register of Deeds of the county in which the land is located a notice that
the statement of conditions is no longer in effect.



   (K)   Amendment of conditions.



      (1)   During the time period for commencement of an approved
development or use specified pursuant to division (H) above or during any
extension thereof granted by the City Council, the Council shall not add to
or alter the conditions in the statement of conditions.



      (2)   The statement of conditions may be amended thereafter in
the same manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and statement of
conditions.



   (L)   City right to rezone.



      (1)   Nothing in the statement of conditions nor in the
provisions of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the city from rezoning
all or any portion of land that is subject to a statement of conditions to
another zoning classification.



      (2)   Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this
chapter and the State Zoning Enabling Act.



   (M)   Failure to offer conditions. The city shall not require an
owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer
of conditions shall not affect an owner’s rights under this chapter.

      (4)   A boundary indicated as following a railroad line shall
be construed as being located midway in the right-of-way;



      (5)   A boundary indicated as following a shoreline shall be
construed as following such shoreline, and in the event of change in the
shoreline shall be construed as following the shoreline existing at the time
the interpretation is made;



      (6)   The boundary indicated as following the centerline of a
stream or river, canal, lake, or other body of water shall be construed as
following such centerline;



      (7)   A distance not specifically indicated on the official
zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map; and



      (8)   Where an existing physical feature is at variance with
that shown on the official zoning map or any other circumstances not covered
by divisions (C)(1) through (C)(7) above, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
interpret the location of the zoning district boundary.

SPECIAL ZONING PROVISIONS




§ 154.085  INTENT.



   The intent of this subchapter is to provide for those regulations which
apply to those specific land uses, which may be treated either as permitted
or special land use in certain zoning districts.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)



§ 154.086  OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT OPTION.



   The open space development option may be applied for as a special use
in R-1, R-2, and R-3 Districts subject to the standards set forth in §
154.023 and this section.



   (A)   Intent. The intent of the open space development option is to
permit the development of residential patterns which, through design
innovation, will: allow greater flexibility; encourage a more creative
approach to the development of single-family residential areas; encourage a
more efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of the land; provide a more
desirable living environment through the preservation and conservation of
natural features such as topography, wetlands, woodlands, bodies of water,
and other natural assets; and encourage the provision of open space so that
benefits may accrue directly to the residents of the development.



   (B)   Qualification of parcels. The parcel must be located in a
district zoned for residential use and must meet one or more of the following
characteristics listed below. Requests for qualification under these
conditions must be supported by documented evidence supplied by the applicant
in either narrative or graphic form:



      (1)   The parcel contains natural assets, which would be
preserved through the use of a clustered development. Such assets may include
natural stands of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for
wildlife, wetlands, bodies of water, unusual topographic features, or other
natural assets, which should be preserved;



      (2)   The parcel contains major topographic conditions which
would require mass grading resulting in loss of significant natural features;
and/or



      (3)   The parcel contains substantial portions of floodplain
and wetlands.



   (C)   Site design requirements. All developments submitted under
this option shall conform to the following site design requirements.



      (1)   Development is permitted as either attached or detached
dwelling units, provided the number of attached units shall not exceed 20% of
the total number of units.



      (2)   (a)   When completed, the development shall have 20%
of the gross acreage in the development devoted to open space, which shall
remain in its natural state and/or be restricted to active and/or passive
outdoor recreational purposes. Dedication of open space shall comply with the
standards set forth in § 154.087. Designated open space shall include area
within any greenbelts required by divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below, subject
to the restrictions contained herein.



         (b)   The computation of designated open space shall not
include: rights-of-way or easements designated for road purposes; areas
within the minimum setbacks of a dwelling unit; land which is underwater
(lakes, streams, watercourses, and other similar bodies of water); any area
to be improved into a lake or pond; and/or more than 25% of the area of
regulated wetlands.



      (3)   (a)   In addition to any required minimum setback
specified in division (C)(6) below, a greenbelt, the minimum width as set
forth below, shall be required along any adjacent public street. The
greenbelt shall be measured from the street right-of-way. The Planning
Commission, at its discretion, may permit either reductions or variations in
width of the greenbelt taking into consideration topographic and/or other
natural resource conditions, density of existing vegetation to be preserved,
and size and shape of the development site.



         (b)   The following minimum greenbelt from adjacent
public streets shall be applied.

      (4)   In order to provide an orderly transition of density
when an open space development abuts a single-family residential district of
equal or lower density, the Planning Commission, at its discretion, may
require one or more of the following measures: designation of open space
along the common boundaries; screening in accordance with the requirements of
§ 154.111(E); and/or an area or row of lots of commensurate size as
neighboring residential lots.



      (5)   The number of dwelling units within any development
permitted hereunder shall not exceed the number of dwelling units permitted
in the zoning district in which the proposed development is located without
application of the open space development option. The applicant must submit a
concept plan that illustrates a site layout without the open space
development option and all applicable ordinances and laws observed.



      (6)   Minimum setback requirements are established in a manner
which permits variation in the siting of individual dwelling units in order
to encourage creativity in design and compatibility with natural resource
features. The minimum setback requirements for each dwelling unit shall be
shown on the site plan as follows.

   (A)   (1)   Whenever the preservation of open space is required
by this chapter, the applicant shall provide a demonstrated means that all
open space portions of the development will be maintained in the manner
approved. Documents shall be presented that bind all successors and future
owners in fee title to commitments made as a part of the proposal. This
provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, provided
notice of such transfer is provided to the city and the land uses continue as
approved in the open space development plan.



      (2)   The dedicated open space shall be set aside by the
applicant through an irrevocable conveyance that is found acceptable to the
City Attorney, such as:



         (a)   Recorded deed restrictions; and/or



         (b)   Covenants that run perpetually with the land.



   (B)   Such conveyance shall assure that the open space will be
protected from all forms of development, except as shown on an approved site
plan, and shall never be changed to another use. Such conveyance shall:



      (1)   Indicate the proposed allowable use(s) of the dedicated
open space;



      (2)   Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that

§ 154.098  WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.



   (A)   Findings.



      (1)   The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“the
Act”), being 47 U.S.C. Ch. 5, Subchs. I, II and VI, grants the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) exclusive jurisdiction over:



         (a)   The regulation of the environmental effects of
radio frequency (RF) emissions from telecommunications facilities; and



         (b)   The regulation of radio signal interference among
users of the RF spectrum.



      (2)   The city’s regulation of WCEC, WCE and WCSS in the
city will not have the effect of prohibiting any person from providing
wireless telecommunications services in violation of the act.



   (B)   Purposes. The general purpose of this section is to regulate
the placement, construction, and modification of WCEC, WCE and WCSS in order
to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same
time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless telecommunications marketplace in the city. Specifically, the
purposes of this chapter are:



      (1)   To regulate the location of WCEC, WCE, and WCSS in the
city;



      (2)   To protect residential areas and land uses from
potential adverse impact of WCEC, WCE, and WCSS;



      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impact of WCEC, WCE, and WCSS
through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;



      (4)   To promote and encourage the collocation of WCE as a
primary option rather than construction of new WCSS;



      (5)   To promote and encourage utilization of technological
designs that will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new
WCSS structures to support WCE;



      (6)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by WCEC,
WCE, and WCSS by ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully designed,
constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or are
determined to be structurally unsound; and



      (7)   To ensure that WCEC, WCE, and WCSS are compatible with
surrounding land uses.



   (C)   Collocation of wireless communications equipment (WCE).



      (1)   To encourage collocation and to minimize the number of
WCSS within the city, WCE shall be considered a permitted accessory use and
not subject to local zoning approval by the city when all of the following
criteria are met:



         (a)   The WCE will be collocated on an existing WCSS or
an existing equipment compound;



         (b)   The existing WCSS or existing equipment compound
is in compliance with local zoning requirements or received prior approval by
the city;



         (c)   The proposed collocation will not:



            1.   Increase the overall height of the WCSS by
more than 20 feet or 10% of its original height, whichever is greater;



            2.   Increase the width of the WCSS by more than
the minimum necessary to permit collocation; and



            3.   Increase the area of the existing WCEC to
greater than 2,500 square feet.



         (d)   The proposed collocation complies with the terms
and conditions of any previous final approval of the WCSS or equipment
compound by the city.



      (2)   WCE installations that are part of a proposed
collocation activity that meet the requirements of divisions (C)(1)(a) and
(C)(1)(b) above, but do not meet the requirements of division (C)(1)(c) above
or division (C)(1)(d) above, shall be subject to special use approval
procedures outlined in § 154.023. The Zoning Administrator shall determine
that the special use permit application is administratively complete within
14 business days of its receipt. The Planning Commission shall also approve
or deny the application not more than 60 days after the application is
considered to be administratively complete.



      (3)   WCE installations that are part of a proposed
collocation activity and which also fully meet the requirements of division
(C)(1) above shall be considered a permitted use of property and not subject
to special use procedures or any other zoning approval by the city. Plans for
such installation shall be administratively reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator to verify compliance with such requirements. The Zoning
Administrator shall complete his or her administrative review of the proposed
installation plans within 14 business days of his or her receipt of such
plans.

structures located within a WCEC shall not be greater than 15 feet in height
and shall meet all requirements for accessory buildings specified in §
154.061.



         (c)   All WCE shall be designed to blend into or meet
the aesthetic character of the principal (primary) structure where reasonably
practical, taking into consideration the location of the WCE and the line of
sight angle and its visibility and distance from the right-of-way and
neighboring uses.



         (d)   WCE proposed to be located on a historic landmark
or in a designated historic district may be denied if the WCE would visually
detract from the historic character of the historic landmark or district.



         (e)   This section shall not exempt the applicant from
such other government review and permitting procedures (i.e., FCC, FAA, and
the like).



      (2)   The installation of WCE not part of a proposed
collocation activity meeting the requirements of division (D)(1) above shall
be considered to be a permitted use of property not subject to special use
permit approval or any other zoning approval by the city. Plans for such
installation shall be administratively reviewed by the Zoning Administrator
to verify compliance with such requirements. The Zoning Administrator shall
complete his or her administrative review of the proposed installation plans
within 14 business days of his or her receipt of such plans.

         (a)   In the case of a requested modification to the
setback requirement, division (F) above, that the setback requirement cannot
be met on the parcel of land upon which the WCSS is proposed to be located
and the alternative for the person is to locate the WCSS at another site
which is closer in proximity to a residentially zoned land;



         (b)   In the case of a request for modification to the
separation and buffer requirements from other WCSS of division (F) above,
that the proposed site is zoned General Commercial or Limited Industrial and
the proposed site is at least double the minimum standard for separation from
residentially zoned lands as provided for in division (F) above;



         (c)   In the case of a request for modification of the
separation and buffer requirements from residentially zoned land of division
(F) above, if the applicant provides written technical evidence from a
licensed engineer(s) that the proposed WCSS and WCE must be located at the
proposed site in order to meet the coverage requirements of the applicant’s
wireless communications system and if the person is willing to create
approved landscaping and other buffers to screen the WCEC and WCSS from being
visible to residentially zoned property; and



         (d)   In the case of a request for modification of the
height limit for WCSS, that the modification is necessary to:



            1.   Facilitate collocation of WCE in order to
avoid construction of a new WCSS; or



            2.   To meet the coverage requirements of the
applicant’s wireless communications system, which requirements must be
documented with written, technical evidence from an engineer(s) that
demonstrates that the height of the proposed WCSS is the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily, and no WCSS that is taller than such
minimum height shall be approved.



   (Q)   Abandonment.



      (1)   If any WCSS shall cease to be used for a period of 270
consecutive days, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the owner, with a
copy to the applicant, that the site will be subject to a determination by
the Planning Commission that such site has been abandoned. The owner shall
have 30 days from receipt of said notice to show, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the WCSS has been in use or under repair during the period. If
the owner fails to show that the WCSS has been in use or under repair during
the period, the City Council shall issue a final determination of abandonment
for the site. Upon issuance of the final determination of abandonment, the
owner shall, within 75 days, dismantle and remove the WCSS.



      (2)   To secure the obligation set forth in this section, the
applicant, and/or owner, shall post a bond, at the time of issuance of the
building permit, in the minimum amount of $50,000. Said bond shall be renewed
annually. Such amount shall be determined by the Planning Commission based on
the anticipated cost of removal of the WCSS.

§ 154.099  JOINT WORKING AND LIVING QUARTERS.



   (A)   Purpose. This section provides standards for the development
of new work/live units and for the reuse of existing commercial structures to
accommodate work/live opportunities where allowed by the applicable zoning
district regulations of the Local Service District (LS). A work/live unit
shall function predominantly as work space with incidental residential
accommodations that meet basic habitability requirements.



   (B)   Design and development standards.



      (1)   Work/live units shall be subject to the following
criteria, as well as all standards of the LS District.



      (2)   General prerequisites include the following: at the time
of application approval and for the reasonable foreseeable future, the
commercial site and surrounding area are suitable for joint residential and
commercial use; the project is designed to provide flexible work space in
conjunction with living areas that are conducive to work environment; and
residential and commercial uses are integrated in such a manner as to address
noise, hazardous materials, and other health and safety issues on-site as
well as off-site.



   (C)   Space requirements.



      (1)   The project site must remain primarily in commercial
use. At no time shall more than 50% of the combined floor area of buildings
identified for reuse or new buildings constructed on a project site be
dedicated or used for work/live units. All remaining floor area on a project
site shall be dedicated and reserved exclusively for other commercial and
uses allowable in the LS District.



      (2)   All designated work space shall be designed to
accommodate commercial uses as evidenced by the provision of flooring,
interior storage, ventilation, storefront windows, roll-up doors, and/or
other physical improvements of the type commonly found in exclusively
commercial facilities used for the same work activity.



      (3)   The living area of the work/live unit shall be at least
500 square feet and shall not be occupied so that each person residing
therein shall have less than 200 square feet of living space.



      (4)   The living area of the work/live unit shall be attached
to or part of the primary building in which a business is normally operated.



   (D)   Integration of commercial and living space. The commercial use
shall be the primary focus of the front of the building. Living space shall
be physically integrated into the work/live unit and shall not be separately
rented, leased, or sold. Mezzanines and lofts within the unit may be used as
living space subject to compliance, with the other provisions of this section.



   (E)   Parking requirements. Work/live units shall comply with the
parking standards set forth in §§ 154.175 through 154.184. A minimum of two
spaces for the residential use shall be included as part of the parking
calculation. The Planning Commission may modify this requirement to decrease
or increase the required parking as appropriate to allow for the reuse of
existing structures with limited parking or to accommodate authorized
employees and/or customer or client visits.



   (F)   Operating requirement.



      (1)   A work/live unit shall be occupied and used only by the
owner of the business within the unit and his or her immediate family
(specifically defined as spouse and children/stepchildren).



      (2)   The owner or developer of any structure containing
work/live units shall provide written notice to all work/live occupants and
users that the surrounding area may be subject to levels of dust, fumes,
noise, or other effects associated with commercial uses at higher levels than
would be expected in more typical residential areas. Noise and other
standards shall be those applicable to commercial properties in the LS
District.



      (3)   An ongoing business must exist to allow residential
occupancy of the work/live unit. If the business ceases to operate, the
special land use permit shall end and the living area must be vacated within
six months of the last day of business.



      (4)   The business and residential areas must be maintained
separately and no business activity inclusive of, but not limited to, storage
of any inventory or servicing or maintenance of any product shall be allowed
in the residential area.



      (5)   Special use permits under this section shall be issued
for a period of one year and must be renewed annually by application of the
occupants. No fee shall be required for this renewal.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND DESIGN PROVISIONS



§ 154.110  PURPOSE.



   Environmental standards are established in order to preserve the short-
and long-term environmental health, safety, and quality of the city. No
parcel, lot, building, or structure in any district shall be used or occupied
in any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious, noxious, or otherwise
objectionable element or condition so as to adversely affect the surrounding
area or adjoining premises. Any use permitted by this chapter may be
undertaken and maintained if acceptable measures and safeguards are employed
to limit dangerous and objectionable elements to acceptable limits as
established by the following performance standards. No use, otherwise
allowed, shall be permitted within any district, which does not conform to
the following standards of use, occupancy, and operation. These standards are
established as minimum requirements to be maintained.

      (4)   Require buffering of residential areas from more intense
land uses and public road rights-of-way;



      (5)   Prevent soil erosion and soil depletion and promote
sub-surface water retention;



      (6)   Encourage an appropriate mixture of plant material, such
as evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs, to protect against insect and
disease infestation and produce a more aesthetic and cohesive design; and



      (7)   Encourage the integration of existing woodlands in
landscape plans.



   (B)   Landscaping definitions. For the purpose of this section, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.



      BERM. A landscaped mound of earth, which blends with the
surrounding terrain.



      BUFFER. A landscaped area composed of living material, a screen
wall, berm, or combination thereof, established and/or maintained to provide
visual screening, noise reduction, and transition between conflicting types
of land uses.



      CONFLICTING NON-RESIDENTIAL LAND USE. Any non-residential use,
such as office, commercial, industrial, research, parking, or public road
right-of-way land use which abuts a residential land use.



      CONFLICTING RESIDENTIAL USE. Any residential land use developed
at a higher density, which abuts a residential land use developed at a lower
density.



      GREENBELT. A landscaped area, established at a depth of the
minimum required front yard setback within a zoning district, which is
intended to provide a transition between a public road right-of-way and an
existing or proposed land use and/or between a conflicting land use and an
existing or proposed land use.



      OPACITY. The state of being impervious to sight.



      PLANT MATERIAL. A collection of living evergreen and/or
deciduous, woody-stemmed trees, shrubs, vines, and ground cover, including
annual and perennial bedding plants.



   (C)   Application of requirements.



      (1)   These requirements shall apply to all uses for which
site plan review is required under § 154.024 and subdivision plat review as
required under the Subdivision Control Ordinance.



      (2)   No site plan, site condominium plan, or subdivision plat
shall be approved unless a landscape plan is provided which meets the
requirements set forth herein.



   (D)   Landscape plan requirements. A separate detailed landscape
plan shall be required to be submitted to the city as part of the site plan
review or tentative preliminary plat review. The landscape plan shall
demonstrate that all requirements of this section are met and shall include,
but not necessarily be limited to, the following items:



      (1)   Location, spacing, size, root type, and descriptions for
each plant type;



      (2)   Typical straight cross section including slope, height,
and width of berms;



      (3)   Typical construction details to resolve specific site
conditions, such as landscape retaining walls and tree wells used to preserve
existing trees or maintain natural grades;



      (4)   Details in either text or drawing form to ensure proper
installation and establishment of proposed plant materials;



      (5)   Identification of existing trees and vegetative cover to
be preserved;



      (6)   Identification of grass and other ground cover and
method of planting; and



      (7)   Identification of a landscape maintenance program
including statement that all diseased, damaged, or dead materials shall be
replaced in accordance with the standards of this chapter.



   (E)   Screening between land uses. (See Figure 7.) Upon any
improvement for which a site plan is required, a landscape buffer shall be
constructed to create a visual screen at least six feet in height along all
adjoining boundaries between either a conflicting non-residential or
conflicting residential land use and residentially zoned or used property.
The width of the buffer may vary, provided that all standards of this section
are met. A landscape buffer may consist of earthen berms and/or living
materials so as to maintain a minimum opacity of at least 80%. Opacity shall
be measured by observation of any two square yard area of landscape screen
between one foot above the established grade of the area to be concealed and
the top or the highest point of the required screen. The plantings must meet
this standard based upon reasonably anticipated growth over a period of three
years. Where a need to provide a greater noise or dust barrier or to screen
more intense development is determined by the Planning Commission, a solid
wall, fence, or landscaped berm, or combination thereof, shall be required.
Such screen shall be a minimum of six feet in height as measured on the side
of the proposed wall having the higher grade. When a wall is required by the
Planning Commission, the required wall shall be located on the lot line
except where underground utilities interfere and except in instances where
this chapter requires conformity with front yard setback requirements. Upon
review of the landscape plan, the Planning Commission may approve an
alternate location of a wall. The Planning Commission shall approve the
construction materials of the wall or fence, which may include face brick,
integral color split-face masonry, stone, or wood.

      (1)   Required landscaping within parking lots. Separate
landscape areas shall be provided within parking lots in accordance with the
following requirements (see Figure 8):



         (a)   A minimum of one tree shall be provided for every
eight parking spaces, provided that a landscape island shall be provided for
no more than 16 continuous spaces;



         (b)   Landscaping shall be arranged in curbed islands
within the parking lot, which shall not be less than 50 square feet in area;



         (c)   A minimum distance of three feet from the backside
of the curb and the proposed centerline of the landscape plantings shall be
provided. Where vehicles overhang a landscape island or strip, a minimum
distance of five feet from the backside of the curb and the proposed
centerline of the landscape plantings shall be provided;



         (d)   The Planning Commission, at its discretion, may
approve alternative landscape plantings at the perimeter of parking lots
where landscaping within parking lots would be impractical due to the size of
the parking lot or detrimental to safe and efficient traffic flow, or would
create an unreasonable burden for maintenance and snowplowing; and



         (e)   All landscaped areas shall be protected with
raised concrete curbs.



      (2)   Required landscaping at the perimeter of parking lots.

public road right-of-way. Non-ornamental deciduous trees within a greenbelt
shall be a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches or greater. Evergreen
trees within a greenbelt shall be a minimum height of six feet;



      (2)   If ornamental deciduous trees are substituted for either
non-ornamental deciduous trees or evergreen trees, they shall be provided at
a minimum of one tree for every 20 lineal feet, or fraction thereof, of
frontage abutting a public road right-of-way. Ornamental deciduous trees
within a greenbelt shall be a minimum caliper of two inches or greater;



      (3)   In addition to the required trees within the greenbelt,
the remainder of the greenbelt shall be landscaped in grass, ground cover,
shrubs, and other natural landscape materials; and



      (4)   Access drives from public rights-of-way through required

   (H)   Site landscaping. In addition to any landscape greenbelt
and/or parking lot landscaping required by this section, 20% of the site
area, excluding existing public rights-of-way, shall be landscaped. Such site
area landscaping may include a combination of the preservation of existing
tree cover, planting of new trees and plant material, landscape plazas and
gardens, and building foundation planting beds. Site area landscaping shall
be provided to screen potentially objectionable site features such as, but
not limited to, retention/detention ponds, transformer pads, air conditioning
units, and loading areas. (See Figure 11.)



Figure 11







   (I)   Subdivision and site condominium landscaping. Landscaping for
single-family residential subdivisions and site condominiums shall be
provided in accordance with the following requirements.



      (1)   Street trees. The frontage of all internal public or
private streets shall be landscaped with a minimum of one tree for every 50
lineal feet, or fraction thereof. Such street trees shall meet the minimum
size and spacing requirements set forth in division (L) below.



      (2)   Screening between land uses. Where a subdivision or site
condominium contain uses which are defined as conflicting land uses by this
section, the screening requirements set forth in division (E) above shall be
met.



      (3)   Screening from public roads. Where a subdivision or site
condominium abuts a public road right-of-way located outside of the proposed
subdivision or site condominium, the screening requirements set forth in
division (E) above shall be met.



      (4)   Other site improvements. A landscape plan for a
subdivision or site condominium development shall also include landscaping
details of the entrance to the development, stormwater retention and/or
detention areas, community buildings and other recreational areas, and any
other site improvement which would be enhanced through the addition of
landscaping.



   (J)   Screening of trash containers. (See Figure 12.)



      (1)   Outside trash disposal containers shall be screened on
all sides with an opaque fence or wall, and gate at least as high as the
container, but no less than six feet in height, and shall be constructed of
material which is compatible with the architectural materials used in the
site building or project.



      (2)   Containers shall be consolidated to minimize the number
of collection sites, and located so as to reasonably equalize the distance
from the buildings or projects they serve.



      (3)   Containers and enclosures shall be located away from
public view insofar as possible.



      (4)   Containers and enclosures shall be situated so that they
do not cause excessive nuisance or offense to occupants of nearby buildings.



      (5)   Concrete pads of appropriate size and construction shall
be provided for containers or groups of containers. Concrete aprons shall
also be provided for bin loading.



      (6)   For storage of recyclable materials, the enclosure area
and pad size shall be increased to amply accommodate the extra materials and
their containers.



      (7)   Screening and gates shall be of a durable construction.
Gates shall be made of wood or other durable material and shall be reinforced
with a steel sub-structure.



      (8)   Landscaping shall be provided within three feet of the
perimeter of the trash container, and shall consist of evergreen trees or
large evergreen shrubs consistent with division (K) below.



Figure 12







   (K)   Landscape elements. The following minimum standards shall
apply.



      (1)   Quality. Plant materials shall be of generally
acceptable varieties and species, free from insects and diseases, hardy to
the county, conform to the current minimum standard of the American
Association of Nurserymen, and shall have proof of any required governmental
regulations and/or inspections.



      (2)   Composition. A mixture of plant material, such as
evergreen, deciduous trees, and shrubs, is recommended as a protective
measure against insect and disease infestation. A limited mixture of hardy
species is recommended rather than a large quantity of different species to
produce a more aesthetic, cohesive design and avoid a disorderly appearing
arrangement.



      (3)   Berms. Berms shall be constructed with slopes not to
exceed a one to three gradient. Berm slopes shall be protected with sod,
seed, mulch, or other form of natural living ground cover.



      (4)   Existing trees. The preservation and incorporation of
existing trees is encouraged. Where existing trees are used to satisfy the
requirements of this section, the following requirements shall apply:



         (a)   Paving or other site improvements shall not
encroach upon the dripline of the existing tree(s) to be preserved;



         (b)   If existing plant material is labeled “To
Remain” on site plans by the applicant or required by the city, protective
techniques such as, but not limited to, fencing or barriers placed at the
dripline around the perimeter of the plant material shall be installed during
construction. No vehicle or other construction equipment shall be parked or
stored within the dripline of any plant material intended to be saved. Other
protective techniques may be used provided such techniques are approved by
the Planning Commission; and



         (c)   In the event that healthy trees which are used to
meet the minimum requirements of this chapter or those labeled to remain are
cut down, destroyed, damaged, filled, or excavated at the dripline, as
determined by the city, the contractor shall replace them with trees which
meet ordinance requirements.



      (5)   Installation, maintenance, and completion.



         (a)   All landscaping required by this chapter shall be
planted before obtaining a certificate of occupancy or the appropriate
financial guarantee, as set forth in § 154.027, shall be placed in escrow in
the amount of the cost of landscaping to be released only after landscaping
is completed.



         (b)   All landscaping and landscape elements shall be
planted, and earth moving or grading performed, in a sound workmanlike
manner, according to accepted planting and grading procedures.



         (c)   The owner of property required to be landscaped by
this chapter shall maintain such landscaping in a strong and healthy
condition, free from refuse, debris, and insects. All materials used to
satisfy the requirements of this chapter which become unhealthy or dead shall
be replaced within one year of damage or death or the next appropriate
planting period, whichever comes first. All landscaped areas shall be
provided with a readily available and acceptable water supply. Mulching up to
the base of trees shall be prohibited.



   (L)   Minimum size and spacing requirements. Where landscaping is
required the following schedule sets forth minimum size and spacing
requirements; for representative landscape materials.

§ 154.120  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.



   (A)   (1)   All developments and earth changes subject to review
under the requirements of this chapter shall be designed, constructed, and
maintained to prevent flooding and protect water quality. The particular
facilities and measures required on-site shall reflect the natural features,
wetlands, and watercourses on the site; the potential for on-site and
off-site flooding, water pollution, and erosion; and the size of the site.



      (2)   Where it is determined that the public storm drainage
system lacks sufficient capacity to control drainage to off-site properties
and drainageways, the city may require on-site detention storage of
stormwater in accordance with the standards of the city and County Drain
Commission.



   (B)   Stormwater management shall comply with the following
standards.



      (1)   The design of storm sewers, detention facilities, and
other stormwater management facilities shall comply with the standards of the
County Drain Commission or the city design standards, whichever is more
restrictive.



      (2)   Stormwater management conveyance, storage, and
infiltration measures and facilities shall be designed to prevent flood
hazards and water pollution related to stormwater runoff and soil erosion
from the proposed development.



      (3)   The use of swales and vegetated buffer strips is
encouraged in cases where it is safe as a method of stormwater conveyance so
as to decrease runoff velocity, allow for natural infiltration, allow
suspended sediment particles to settle, and to remove pollutants.



      (4)   Alterations to natural drainage patterns shall not
create flooding or water pollution for adjacent or downstream property owners.



      (5)   Discharge of runoff from any site, which may contain
oil, grease, toxic chemicals, or other polluting materials is prohibited. If
a property owner desires to propose measures to reduce and trap pollutants,
the owner must meet the requirements of the State Department of Environmental
Quality and the County Drain Commissioner, based upon professionally accepted
principles, such a proposal shall be submitted and reviewed by the City
Engineer, with consultation of appropriate experts.



      (6)   Drainage systems shall be designed to protect public
health and safety and to be visually attractive, taking into consideration
viable alternatives.



      (7)   Maintenance of detention basins shall be the
responsibility of the property owner.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)  Penalty, see § 154.999



§ 154.121  REGULATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS.



   (A)   Purpose.



      (1)   The floodplains of the city are subject to periodic
inundation of floodwaters, which result in loss of property, health, and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental service, and
impairment of tax base.



      (2)   It is the purpose of this section to comply with the
provisions and requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program, as
constituted in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,
being 42 U.S.C. §§ 4001 through 4218, and subsequent enactments and rules
and regulations promulgated in furtherance of this program by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as published in the Federal Register,
Vol. 41, No. 207, October 26, 1976, and redesignated at 44 F.R. 31177, May
31, 1979.



      (3)   The provisions of this section are intended to:



         (a)   Help protect human life, prevent or minimize
material losses, and reduce the cost to the public for rescue and relief
efforts;



         (b)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to
health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause excessive increases
in flood heights or velocities;



         (c)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
public facilities which serve such uses, shall be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;



         (d)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are
designated to be unsuited for intended purposes because of flooding; and



         (e)   Permit reasonable economic use of property located
within a designated floodplain area.



   (B)   Delineation of floodplain areas.



      (1)   Designated floodplain areas shall overlay existing
zoning districts delineated on the zoning district map of the city. The
boundaries of the floodplain areas are identified in the report entitled the
“Flood Insurance Study, City of Linden” prepared by FEMA with an
effective date of 1980, as may be revised from time to time. The study and
accompanying maps are adopted by reference, appended, and declared to be part
of this chapter.



      (2)   The standard applied to establishing the floodplain area
is the base floodplain delineated by the base flood. In areas associated with
riverine flooding, a floodway is designated within the floodplain area.



      (3)   Where disputes as to the location of a floodplain area
boundary arise, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall resolve the dispute in
accordance with §§ 154.215 through 154.219.



   (C)   Application of regulations.



      (1)   In addition to other requirements of this chapter
applicable to development in the underlying zoning district, compliance with
the requirements of this section shall be necessary for all development
occurring within designated floodplain areas. Conflicts between the
requirements of this section and other requirements of this chapter or any
other ordinance shall be resolved in favor of this section, except where the
conflicting requirement is more stringent and would further the objectives of
this section. In such cases, the more stringent requirement shall be applied.



      (2)   Upon application for land use permits, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine whether said use is located within a designated
floodplain area utilizing the documents cited in division (B) above. The
issuance of a land use permit within the floodplain area shall comply with
the following standards:



         (a)   The requirements of this section shall be met;



         (b)   The requirement of the underlying districts and
all other applicable provisions of this chapter shall be met; and



         (c)   All necessary development permits shall have been
issued by appropriate local, state, and federal authorities, including a
floodplain permit, approval, or letter of authority from the state’s
Floodplain Regulatory Authority, found in Part 31, Water Resources
Protection, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act
(NREPA), Public Act 451 of 1994, being M.C.L.A. §§ 324.11501 et seq., as
amended. Where a development permit cannot be issued prior to the issuance of
a zoning compliance permit, a letter from the issuing agency indicating
intent to issue contingent only upon proof of zoning compliance shall be
acceptable.



      (3)   Floodplain management administrative duties are as
follows.



         (a)   With regard to the National Flood Insurance
Program, and the regulation of development within the flood hazard area zone

   (A)   A planned unit development (PUD) may be applied for in any
zoning district. The granting of a planned unit development application shall
require a rezoning by way of amendment of this chapter upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval of the City Council.



   (B)   Any land use authorized in this chapter may be included in a
planned unit development, subject to adequate public health, safety, and
welfare protection mechanisms being designed into the development to ensure
the compatibility of varied land uses both within and outside the development.



   (C)   The applicant for a planned unit development must demonstrate
each of the following criteria as a condition to being entitled to planned
unit development treatment:



      (1)   Granting of the planned unit development will result in
at least one of the following:



         (a)   A recognizable and material benefit to the
ultimate users of the project and to the community, where such benefit would
otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved without application of the
planned unit development regulations;



         (b)   Long-term protection and preservation of natural
resources and natural features of a significant quantity and/or quality,
where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved
without application of the planned unit development regulations; or



         (c)   A nonconforming use shall, to a material extent,
be rendered more conforming, or less offensive, to the zoning district in
which it is situated.



      (2)   The proposed type and density of use shall not result in
an unreasonable increase in the need for or burden upon public services,
facilities, streets, and utilities;



      (3)   The proposed development shall be consistent with the
public health, safety, and welfare of the city;



      (4)   The proposed development shall not result in an
unreasonable negative environmental impact on the subject site or surrounding
land;



      (5)   The proposed development shall not result in an
unreasonable negative economic impact upon surrounding properties;



      (6)   The proposed development shall be under single ownership
and/or control such that there is a single person having responsibility for
completing the project in conformity with this chapter; and



      (7)   The proposed development shall be consistent with the
goals and policies of the Master Plan.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)



§ 154.137  PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW.



   (A)   Pre-application conference. Prior to the submission of an
application for planned unit development approval, the applicant shall meet
with the Zoning Administrator, together with any staff and consultants the
Administrator deems appropriate. The applicant shall present at such
conference, or conferences, at least a sketch plan of the proposed planned
unit development, as well as the following information: total number of acres
in the project; a statement of the number of residential units, if any; the
number and type of non-residential uses, the number of acres to be occupied
by each type of use; the known deviations from ordinance regulations to be
sought; the number of acres to be preserved as open or recreational space;
and all known natural resources and natural features to be preserved.



   (B)   Preliminary plan.



      (1)   Following the pre-application conference, the applicant
shall submit a preliminary site plan of the proposed planned unit
development. The preliminary site plan shall be prepared in accordance with
the standard set forth in § 154.024(C). A narrative report shall accompany
the site plan providing a description of the project, discussing the market
concept and feasibility of the project, and explaining the manner in which
the criteria set forth in § 154.136(C) have been met.



      (2)   The preliminary plan shall be noticed for public hearing
as a zoning amendment before the Planning Commission. Following the hearing,
the Planning Commission shall review the preliminary site plan and shall take
one of the following actions.



         (a)   Approval.



            1.   Upon finding that the preliminary plan meets
the criteria and standards set forth in §§ 154.135 and 154.136, the
Planning Commission shall grant preliminary approval. Approval shall
constitute approval of the uses and design concept as shown on the
preliminary plan and shall confer upon the applicant the right to proceed to
preparation of the final plan.



            2.   Approval of the preliminary plan by the
Planning Commission shall not constitute rezoning of the property to PUD nor
bind the City Council to approval of the final plan.



         (b)   Tabling. Upon finding that the preliminary plan
does not meet the criteria and standards set forth in §§ 154.135 and
154.136, but could meet such criteria if revised, the Planning Commission may
table action until a revised preliminary plan is resubmitted.



         (c)   Denial. Upon finding that the preliminary plan
does not and cannot meet the criteria and standards set forth in §§ 154.135
and 154.136, the Planning Commission shall deny preliminary approval.



   (C)   Final plan. Within six months following receipt of the
Planning Commission comments on the preliminary plan, the applicant shall
submit a final plan and supporting materials conforming with this section. If
a final plan is not submitted by the applicant for final approval within six
months following receipt of Planning Commission comments, the preliminary
plan approval becomes null and void.



      (1)   Information required. A final site plan and application
for a PUD shall contain the following information:



         (a)   A site plan meeting all requirements of §
154.024(D);



         (b)   A separately delineated specification of all
deviations from this chapter, which would otherwise be applicable to the uses
and development proposed in the absence of this planned unit development
subchapter;



         (c)   A specific schedule of the intended development
and construction details, including phasing or timing;



         (d)   A specific schedule of the general improvements to
constitute a part of the development including, without limitation, lighting,
signage, the mechanisms designed to reduce noise, utilities, and visual
screening features;



         (e)   A specification of the exterior building materials
with respect to the structures proposed in the project; and



         (f)   Signatures of all parties having an interest in
the property.



      (2)   Planning Commission and action.



         (a)   The final plan shall constitute an application to
amend this chapter, and shall be noticed for public hearing as a zoning
amendment before the Planning Commission, and otherwise acted upon by the
Planning Commission and the City Council, as provided by law.



            1.   Approval. Upon finding that the final plan
meets the criteria and standards set forth in §§ 154.135 and 154.136, the
Planning Commission shall recommend approval to the City Council.



            2.   Tabling. Upon finding that the final plan
does not meet the criteria and standards set forth in §§ 154.135 and
154.136, but could meet such criteria if revised, the Planning Commission may
table action until a revised final plan is resubmitted.



            3.   Denial. Upon finding that the final plan does
not and cannot meet the criteria and standards set forth in §§ 154.135 and
154.136, the Planning Commission shall recommend denial to the City Council.



         (b)   The Planning Commission shall, to the extent it
deems appropriate, submit detailed recommendations relative to the planned
unit development project including, without limitation, recommendations with
respect to matters on which the City Council must exercise discretion.



      (3)   City Council action.



         (a)   Upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning
Commission, the City Council shall review the final plan. Taking into
consideration the recommendations of the Planning Commission and the criteria
and standards set forth in §§ 154.135 and 154.136, the City Council shall
approve, table or deny the final plan.



         (b)   Prior to approval of a final plan, the City
Council shall require all standards and conditions of approval to be
incorporated in a development agreement. The agreement shall be prepared by
the City Attorney, reviewed by the City Planner, approved by the City
Council, and signed by both the city and the applicant.

§ 154.138  PROJECT DESIGN STANDARDS.



   (A)   Residential design standards.



      (1)   The property shall be a minimum size of two acres.



      (2)   (a)   Residential density shall not be greater than
the maximum density permitted in the zoning district in which the property is
situated immediately prior to reclassification under this subchapter.



         (b)   Additional density for residential uses may be
allowed at the discretion of the Planning Commission and based upon a
demonstration by the applicant of consistency with the Master Plan and of
planning and design excellence resulting in a material benefit to the city,
adjacent land uses, and/or the ultimate users of the project, where such
benefit would otherwise be unlikely to be achieved without the application of
the PUD regulations including, without limitation, innovative design
producing significant energy efficiency, pedestrian or vehicular safety, long
term aesthetic beauty, and protection and preservation of natural resources
and features.



   (B)   Non-residential design standards.



      (1)   The property shall be a minimum size of one acre.

vehicular traffic ways, shall be separated and buffered from residential
units in a manner consistent with good land and community planning principles.



   (C)   General design standards.



      (1)   (a)   All regulations applicable to setbacks, parking
and loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall be met in
relation to each respective land use in the development based upon zoning
districts in which the use is listed as a principal permitted use. In all
cases, the strictest provisions shall apply.



         (b)   Notwithstanding division (C)(1)(a) above,
deviations with respect to such regulation may be granted as part of the
overall approval of the planned unit development, provided features or
elements demonstrated by the applicant and deemed adequate by the Planning
Commission are designed into the project plan for the purpose of achieving
the objectives of this subchapter.



      (2)   To the maximum extent feasible, the development shall be
designed so as to preserve the natural resources and natural features. The
benefit, which would reasonably be expected to accrue from the proposal,
shall be balanced against the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the
activity, taking into consideration the local, state, and national concern
for the protection and preservation of the natural resources or features and
the following criteria:



         (a)   The availability of feasible and prudent
alternative methods of accomplishing any development;



         (b)   The extent and permanence of the beneficial or
detrimental effects of the proposed activity; and



         (c)   The size, quality, and rarity of the natural
resources or natural features which would be impaired or destroyed.



      (3)   A perimeter setback and berming shall be required from
the Planning Commission for the purpose of buffering the development in
relation to surrounding properties. If the planned unit development project
includes non-residential uses adjacent to a district authorizing residential
uses, and/or if the project is larger than one acre in area, such perimeter
setback shall be established with a dimension from the property line of up to
50 feet at the discretion of the Planning Commission, taking into
consideration the use or uses in and adjacent to the development. The setback
distance need not be uniform at all points on the perimeter of the
development.



      (4)   Thoroughfare, drainage, and utility design shall meet or
exceed the standards otherwise applicable in connection with each of the
respective types of uses served.



      (5)   Underground installation of utilities shall be required,
including electricity and telephone, as found necessary by the Planning
Commission.



      (6)   Pedestrian walkways shall be separated from vehicular
circulation, as found necessary by the Planning Commission.



      (7)   Signage, lighting, landscaping, building materials for
the exterior of all structures, and other features of the project shall be
designed and completed with the objective of achieving an integrated and
controlled development, consistent with the character of the community,
surrounding development or developments, and natural features of the area.



      (8)   Where non-residential uses adjoin off-site residentially
zoned property, noise reduction, and visual screening mechanisms such as
earthen and/or landscape berms and/or decorative walls, shall be employed.
The Planning Commission, at its discretion, shall review and approve the
design and location of such mechanisms.



      (9)   The City Council upon the recommendation of the Planning
Commission shall resolve all ambiguities as to applicable regulations using
this chapter, the Master Plan, and other city standards or policies as a
guide.

   (A)   Reasonable conditions may be required with the approval of a
planned unit development, to the extent authorized by law, for the purpose of
ensuring that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use
or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility
loads caused by the land use or activity, protecting the natural environment
and conserving natural resources and energy, ensuring compatibility with
adjacent uses of land, and promoting the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner.

§ 154.140  PHASING AND COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   Phasing. Where a project is proposed for construction in
phases, the planning and designing shall be such that, upon completion, each
phase shall be capable of standing on its own in terms of the presence of
services, facilities, and open space, and shall contain the necessary
components to ensure protection of natural resources and the health, safety,
and welfare of the users of the planned unit development and the residents of
the surrounding area. All conditions that are phase specific shall be
completed during development of the subject phase, and cannot be postponed
for completion during other phases. In addition, in developments which
include residential and non-residential uses, the relative mix of uses, and
the scheduled completion of construction for each phase shall be disclosed
and determined to be reasonable at the discretion of the City Council after
recommendation from the Planning Commission.



   (B)   Commencement and completion of construction. To ensure
completion of required improvements, the city is authorized to impose
performance guarantees in accordance with § 154.027. Construction shall be
commenced within one year following final approval of a planned unit
development and shall proceed substantially in conformance with the schedule
set forth by the applicant, as required by division (A) above. If
construction is not commenced within such time, any approval of a site plan
on the project shall expire and be null and void, provided, an extension for
a specified period may be granted by the City Council upon good cause shown
if such request is made to the City Council prior to the expiration of the
initial period. Moreover, in the event a site plan has expired, the City
Council, based on a recommendation from the Planning Commission, shall be
authorized to rezone the property in any reasonable manner and, if the
property remains classified as PUD, a new application shall be required, and
shall be reviewed in light of then existing and applicable law and ordinance
provisions.

SIGNS



§ 154.155  INTENT AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   The intent of this subchapter is to regulate the location,
size, construction, and manner of display of signs and outdoor advertising in
order to minimize their harmful effects on the public health, safety, and
welfare. While this subchapter recognizes that signs and outdoor advertising
are necessary to promote commerce and public information, failure to regulate
them may lead to poor identification of individual businesses, deterioration
and blight of the business and residential areas of the city, conflicts
between different types of land use, and reduction in traffic safety to
pedestrians and motorists. This subchapter is intended to provide a process
for the application of sign regulations that will allow creatively designed
signs to make a positive visual contribution to the overall image of the
city, while also mitigating the impacts of large or incompatible signs.



   (B)   To achieve its intended purpose, this subchapter has the
following objectives:



      (1)   To prevent the placement of signs in a manner that will
conceal or obscure signs or adjacent businesses;



      (2)   To keep the number of signs and sign messages at the
level reasonably necessary to identify a business and its products;



      (3)   To keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to
the buildings they identify;



      (4)   To reduce visual distraction and obstructions to
motorists traveling along, entering, or leaving streets;



      (5)   To promote a quality manner of display which enhances
the character of the city;



      (6)   To prevent the proliferation of signs which promote

inspected upon completion and may be inspected periodically by the Building
Department representative for compliance with these regulations and with any
applicable ordinances of the city.



   (B)   Maintenance. All signs and components thereof shall be kept in
good repair and in a safe, neat, clean, and attractive condition.



   (C)   Removal.



      (1)   The Zoning Administrator may order the removal of any
permanent sign and its supporting structural components erected or maintained
in violation of these regulations. The Zoning Administrator shall give 30
days’ notice in writing, to the owner of such sign and its supporting
structure requiring him or her to bring such sign into compliance within 60
days. Any sign erected of a temporary nature shall require written notice of
only three days.



      (2)   Upon failure to comply with this notice, the Building
Official or designee may remove the sign and its supporting structure. The
Building Official or designee may remove a sign and its supporting structure
immediately and without notice if, in his or her opinion, the condition of
the sign and its supporting structure presents an immediate threat to the
safety of the public. The cost of such removal by the city shall be assessed
against the owner of such sign or the owner of the building, structure, or
premises.



      (3)   Signs within a public right-of-way or on city property
may be removed by the city without notice and may be disposed of.



   (D)   Obsolete signs.



      (1)   An obsolete sign and its supporting structure shall be
removed by the property owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign
is located when the business which it advertises has been discontinued for at
least 90 days. Except as provided in divisions (D)(2) and (D)(3) below, such
removal shall occur within 30 days after written notice from the Zoning
Administrator.



      (2)   A sign which is in conformity with the other provisions
of this chapter may remain in place if such sign is obscured by the use of a
blank panel attached within the frame of the sign and shall be permitted to
remain for a period not to exceed 120 days.



      (3)   Where a successor to an inactive business agrees, within
30 days of the date of written notice by the Zoning Administrator, to
maintain the sign as provided for by these regulations, this removal
requirement shall not apply, provided that the existing sign and structure
conforms to all current sign requirements.



   (E)   Nonconforming signs.



      (1)   Policy. It is the policy of the city to require that all
signs within the city be brought into compliance with the terms of this
chapter.



      (2)   Valid permit required. The status afforded to signs and
sign structures pursuant to this division (E) shall not be applicable to any
sign or sign structure for which a sign permit was initially required but for
which no sign permit was ever issued. Such sign and/or sign structures are
deemed illegal and are subject to the provisions of division (C) above.



      (3)   Existing sign rendered nonconforming. Nonconforming
signs are those signs that do not comply with the size, placement,
construction, or other standards or regulations of this chapter, but were
lawfully established prior to its adoption. A nonconforming sign may be
continued and shall be maintained in good condition as described elsewhere in
this subchapter, however, the following alterations are regulated.



         (a)   A nonconforming sign shall not be structurally
altered or repaired so as to prolong its useful life or so as to change its
shape, size, type, or design unless such change shall make the sign
conforming.



         (b)   A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by
another nonconforming sign.



         (c)   A nonconforming sign shall not be expanded,
relocated, or modified in any way that would increase the degree of
nonconformity of such sign.



         (d)   A nonconforming sign shall not be reestablished
after obsolescence as defined in division (D) above.   



         (e)   A nonconforming sign must not be reestablished
after damage or destruction if the estimated expense of reconstruction
exceeds 50% of the appraised replacement cost as determined by the Zoning
Administrator or if 50% or more of the face of the sign is damaged or
destroyed.

OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING, AND ACCESS CONTROL



§ 154.175  INTENT AND PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure the provision of off-street
parking facilities that are sufficient in number, adequately sized, and
properly designed to meet the range of parking needs and demands that are
associated with land uses now in place in the city or with land uses allowed
by this chapter.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)



§ 154.176  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Where required. In all zoning districts, off-street parking
facilities for the storage and parking of self-propelled motor vehicles for
the use of occupants, employees, and patrons of the buildings hereafter
erected, altered, or changed existing use after the effective data of this
chapter, shall be provided as herein prescribed. Such space shall be
maintained and shall not be encroached upon so long as said main building or
structure remains, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided
elsewhere in conformance with this chapter.



   (B)   Existing off-street parking at effective date of ordinance.
Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this chapter which
serves an existing building or use, shall not be reduced or increased in size
to less than that required under the terms of this chapter.



   (C)   Required greenbelt and setbacks. Off-street parking, including
maneuvering lanes, shall not be located within the required front greenbelt
in accordance with § 154.111(F) and the schedule of regulations. Off-street
parking shall be permitted within the required side or rear yard setbacks,
provided a minimum five-foot setback is maintained between off-street parking
and the side and rear lot lines of all adjoining properties.



   (D)   Parking duration. Except when land is used as storage space in
connection with the business of a repair or service garage, a 24-hour time
limit for parking in non-residential, off-street parking areas shall prevail,
it being the purpose and intention of the foregoing that the requirement of
maintaining vehicle storage or parking space is to provide for the public
safety in keeping parked cars off the streets, but such requirement is not
designed to or intended to provide, and it shall be unlawful to permit, the
storage or prolonged parking on any such parking area in any such district
wrecked or junked cars, or for creating a junk yard or a nuisance in such
areas.



   (E)   Units and methods of measurement. For the purpose of
determining off-street parking requirements, the following units of
measurement shall apply.



      (1)   Floor area. Where floor area is the unit for determining
the required number of off-street parking spaces, said unit shall mean the
gross floor area, except that floor area within the principal building used
for parking, incidental service and storage, housing of mechanical equipment,
heating systems, and similar uses need not be included.



      (2)   Employees. For requirements stated in terms of
employees, the calculation shall be based upon the maximum number of
employees likely to be on the premises during the largest shift.



      (3)   Places of assembly. In stadiums, sports arenas,
churches, and other places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy
benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each 18 inches of such
shall be counted as one seat. In cases where a place of assembly has both
fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be computed separately
for each type and added together, per the requirements of the Building Code.



      (4)   Fractional requirements. When units or measurements
determining number of required parking spaces result in requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction shall require one parking space.



   (F)   Location of parking.



      (1)   Single- and two-family dwellings.



         (a)   The off-street parking facilities required for
single- and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of
ground as the building they are intended to serve, but shall not be
considered a parking lot under the provisions of this subchapter.



         (b)   Off-street parking shall not be permitted within
the right-of-way adjacent to the lot except within the street or driveway
approach.



         (c)   Off-street parking shall not be permitted within
the front yard, except within a properly constructed driveway, as defined in
this chapter.



         (d)   Where no properly constructed driveway exists, an
exception to subsection (c) above, shall be made for an existing driveway
within the front yard that is not properly constructed. In such case,
off-street parking shall be allowed within an area no wider than 12 feet, or
the width of an existing garage, whichever is greater, centered on such
existing driveway, but not within any area between the dwelling and street.



         (e)   The requirement of subsection (c) above, shall not
apply to parking for temporary special events normally associated with the
residential use of the property such as graduation and holiday parties.



      (2)   Multiple-family residential. The off-street parking
facilities for multiple-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or
plot of ground as the dwellings they are intended to serve, and shall consist
of a parking lot as set forth in this subchapter. In no event shall any
parking space be located nearer than ten feet to any main building.



      (3)   Other land uses. The off-street parking facilities
required for all other uses shall be located on the lot or within 500 feet of
the permitted uses requiring such off-street parking, such distance to be
measured along lines of public access to the property between the nearest
point of the parking facility to the building to be served.



      (4)   Restriction on parking on private property. It shall be
unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to park any motor vehicle on
any private property without the authorization of the owner or agent of such
property.

§ 154.177  OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Generally. The amount of required off-street parking spaces
for new uses or buildings, additions thereto, and additions to existing
buildings shall be determined in accordance with the schedule set forth in §
154.178. Parking requirements listed in § 154.178 shall not include
off-street stacking spaces for drive-through facilities set forth in §
154.181.



   (B)   Similar uses and requirements. When a use is not specifically
mentioned, the requirements of off-street parking for a similar use shall
apply as determined by the Planning Commission.



   (C)   Collective provisions. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent collective provisions of off-street parking facilities
for two or more buildings or uses, provided:



      (1)   Such facilities collectively shall not be less than the
sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately
in accordance with § 154.178. However, the Planning Commission may reduce
the total number of spaces by up to 25% upon a determination that the peak
space requirements for the individual uses occur at distinctly different
times;



      (2)   Each use served by collective off-street parking shall
have direct access to the parking without crossing any public rights-of-way;
and



      (3)   Written easements which provide for continued use and
maintenance of the parking shall be submitted to the city for approval.



   (D)   Parking exemption. As of the effective date of this chapter,
buildings and uses located within the Central Business District (CBD) shall
be exempt from providing off-street parking. However, in no case shall a
building or use be expanded to remove off-street parking established before
the effective date of this chapter. Parking areas constructed in the CBD
shall meet all design requirements of this chapter.



   (E)   Flexibility in application.



      (1)   (a)   The city recognizes that, due to the specific
requirements of any given development, inflexible application of the parking
standards set forth in § 154.178 may result in development with inadequate
parking or parking far in excess of that which is needed.



         (b)   The former situation may lead to traffic
congestion or unauthorized parking on adjacent streets or neighboring sites.
The latter situation may result in excessive paving and stormwater runoff and
a waste of space, which could be left as open space.



      (2)   The Planning Commission, based on a recommendation from
the Planning Consultant may permit deviations from the requirements of §
154.178 and may require more or allow less parking whenever it finds that
such deviations are more likely to provide a sufficient number of parking
spaces to accommodate the specific characteristics of the use in question.



      (3)   (a)   The Planning Commission shall attach conditions
to the approval of a deviation from the requirement of § 154.178 that bind
such approval to the specific use in question.



         (b)   Where a deviation results in a reduction of
parking, the Planning Commission may further impose conditions which ensure
that adequate reserve area is set aside for future parking, as needed.

§ 154.179  OFF-STREET PARKING LOT DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   The construction of any parking lot shall be in accordance
with the requirements of the provisions of this chapter and completed before
a certificate of occupancy is issued.



   (B)   Unless incorporated in a site plan, prepared and approved in
accordance with § 154.024, plans for the development of any parking lot must
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator, prepared at a scale of not less
than 50 feet equals one inch for submittal to the Planning Commission for
approval. All information, including existing and proposed grades, drainage,
pipe sizes, parking of all dimensions, type of curbing, drive and aisle

surfacing and base materials to be used, signage, use, building area, parking
calculations and the layout of the proposed parking lot, and all other
necessary information required by § 154.024, must be provided. All such
parking lots, driveways, or loading areas required for uses other than
single- or two-family residential shall be hard-surfaced with asphalt or
concrete pavement. Drainage for parking lots shall conform to the standards
set forth in § 154.120 and city design standards. All illumination for all
such parking lots shall meet the standards set forth in § 154.117. Parking
lot landscaping and buffering requirements shall meet the standards set forth
in §§ 154.111(D) and 154.111(E). Adequate ingress and egress to the parking
lot, by means of limited and clearly defined drives, shall be provided for
all vehicles. To prevent encroaching upon pedestrian walkways or damaging
required landscaping, curbing or other appropriate barriers shall be

§ 154.180  OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   On the same premises with every building or part thereof,
erected and occupied for any uses involving the receipt or distribution of
trucks and/or delivery vehicles, material, or merchandise, adequate space for
loading and unloading shall be provided.



   (B)   (1)   Off-street loading and unloading space, unless
completely and adequately provided for within a building, shall be of
sufficient area and height clearance to accommodate vehicles using the
loading space, based upon evidence supplied by the applicant and verified by
the Planning Commission. Loading and unloading space provided by truck wells
located below surface grade shall be protected by pipe railings per Building
Code. Drainage shall be provided to prevent the collection of stormwater at
the bottom of the truck well. The loading and unloading space shall be a
minimum of 12 feet wide by 40 feet long. The space shall not be located in
the front yard of a building and shall not be located closer than 50 feet to
any residentially zoned parcel. The Planning Commission may permit deviations
from this standard with conditions where it deems appropriate.



      (2)   The number of spaces provided shall be in accordance
with the following schedule.



 

Gross Floor Area (Sq. Ft.)
 
Loading and Unloading Spaces Required in Terms of Sq. Ft. Gross Floor Area

100,000 and over
 
5 spaces



 



   (C)   (1)   The city recognizes that due to the specific
requirements of any given development, inflexible application of off-street
loading requirements set forth in division (B) above may result in
development with inadequate loading space or loading space in excess of that
which is needed. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or
unauthorized loading on and/or off site. The latter situation may result in
excessive paving and stormwater runoff and a waste of space, which could be
left as open space.



      (2)   The Planning Commission may permit deviations from the
requirements of division (B) above based upon a finding that such deviations
are more likely to provide a sufficient number of off-site loading spaces and
of adequate size to accommodate the specific characteristics of the use in
question.



      (3)   The Planning Commission shall attach conditions to the
approval of a deviation from the requirements of division (B) above that bind
such approval to the specific use in question. Where a deviation results in a
reduction of off-street loading, the Planning Commission shall further impose
conditions, which ensure that adequate usable reserve area is set aside for
further off-street loading, if needed. Where area is set aside for reserve
off-street loading, it shall be easily developed, not devoted to a use other
than open space, and shall be designed to accommodate attendant facilities
vehicle such as maneuvering lanes and drainage.



   (D)   The following additional standards apply to commercial or
similar vehicles in residential zoning districts: parking of commercial
vehicles in residential zoning districts, which are rated over one ton
capacity is prohibited; and open storage of commercial vehicles over one-ton
capacity, including semi-trucks and trailers, mobile homes, tractors,
bulldozers, earth movers, or other similar equipment is prohibited in any
residential zoning district.

§ 154.181  OFF-STREET STACKING SPACE FOR DRIVE-THROUGH FACILITIES.



   All businesses which provide drive-through facilities for serving
customers within their automobile shall provide adequate off-street stacking
space and lanes which meets the following requirements.



   (A)   Each stacking space shall be computed on the basis of eight
feet in width and 20 feet in length. Each stacking lane shall be ten feet in
width;.



   (B)   Clear identification and delineation between the drive-through
facility and parking lot shall be provided. Drive-through facilities shall be
designed in a manner which promotes pedestrian and vehicular safety.



   (C)   For all drive-through facilities which have a single stacking
lane, an escape lane shall be provided which allows other vehicles to pass
those waiting to be serviced.



   (D)   Required stacking spaces may not occupy required or actual
front yard setbacks, unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission.



   (E)   The number of stacking spaces per service lane shall be
provided for the following uses. When a use is not specifically mentioned,
the requirements for off-street stacking space for a similar use shall apply.
The Planning Commission may permit deviations from this requirement if it is
demonstrated that such deviations are appropriate and will improve the site.

§ 154.182  TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS.



   The Planning Commission may require a traffic impact analysis in order
to analyze the effect of development upon existing street traffic. The
traffic impact analysis shall be paid for by the developer and shall examine
existing and proposed traffic flows, trip generation studies, impacts on
major intersections, turning movement analysis, roadway capacity, parking
generation, and site ingress/egress. The traffic impact analysis shall be
prepared by a registered professional engineer or transportation planner.

§ 154.183  ACCESS MANAGEMENT.



   (A)   Automobile access.



      (1)   Access barrier. Access to public roads shall be
controlled in the interest of public safety. Each building or group of
buildings used for non-residential purposes, and its parking or service area,
shall be physically separated from public roads by a greenbelt, curb, or
other suitable barrier against unchanneled motor vehicle access or egress,
except for access ways authorized herein. In addition to providing the access
barrier, greenbelt requirements shall be provided in accordance with §
154.111.



      (2)   Driveway performance standards. Driveways shall conform
to the following performance standards.



         (a)   Driveway design and placement must be in harmony
with internal circulation and parking design such that the entrance can
absorb the maximum rate of inbound traffic during a normal peak traffic
period.



         (b)   Sufficient on-site storage must accommodate at
least three queued vehicles waiting to park or exit without using a portion
of the public right-of-way obstructing existing vehicle sight distance, or
otherwise interfering with street traffic.



         (c)   Provisions for circulation between adjacent
parcels are encouraged through coordinated or joint parking systems and
driveways.



         (d)   Driveways shall be designed to accommodate all
vehicle types having occasion to enter and exit the site, including delivery
vehicles. There shall be clear delineation and/or separation, where
appropriate, of entry and exit lanes within driveways.



         (e)   Driveway placement must be such that loading and
unloading activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress or egress.



   (B)   Pedestrian access.



      (1)   General standard. The parking and circulation system
within each development shall accommodate the movement of vehicles, bicycles,
pedestrians, and transit, throughout the proposed development and to and from
surrounding areas, safely and conveniently, and shall contribute to the
attractiveness of the development. The on-site pedestrian system must provide
continuity, street crossings, visual interest, and security as defined by the
standards in this section.



      (2)   Safety considerations. To the maximum extent feasible,
pedestrians shall be separated from vehicles.



         (a)   Where complete separation of pedestrians and
vehicles is not feasible, potential hazards shall be minimized by the use of
techniques such as special paving, grade separations, pavement marking, signs
or striping, bollards, pedestrian safety island, landscaping, lighting, or
other traffic calming measures to clearly delineate pedestrian areas, for
both day and night use.



         (b)   Where bicycle paths are required or are
specifically part of a site plan and pedestrians and bicyclists share
walkways, the pedestrian/bicycle system shall be designed to be wide enough
to easily accommodate the amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic volumes
that are anticipated. A minimum width of eight feet shall be required and
shall meet American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) guidelines. Additional width of up to four feet may be required to
accommodate higher volumes of bicycle and pedestrian traffic.



      (3)   Curb cuts and ramps. Curb cuts and ramps shall be
located at convenient, safe locations for the physically disabled, for
bicyclists, and for people pushing strollers or carts. The location and
design of barrier-free spaces, curb cuts, and ramps shall meet the
requirements of the State Barrier Free Code and the Americans With
Disabilities Act and, to the extent possible, shall avoid crossing or
funneling pedestrian traffic through loading areas, drive-through lanes, and
outdoor trash storage/collection areas.



      (4)   Site amenities. Development plans shall include site
amenities that enhance safety and convenience and promote walking or
bicycling as an alternative means of transportation. Site amenities may
include bike racks, drinking fountains, canopies, and benches.



      (5)   Walkways.



         (a)   Directness and continuity. Walkways within the
site shall be located and aligned to directly and continuously connect areas
or points of pedestrian origin and destination, and shall not be located and
aligned solely based on the outline of a parking lot configuration that does
not provide such direct pedestrian access. Such connecting walkways shall
either be grade separated from the parking lot or clearly delineated as to
avoid pedestrian/vehicular conflicts with a paved surface not less than six
feet in width. Drive aisles leading to main entrances shall have walkways on
at least one side of the drive aisle.



         (b)   Street crossings. Where it is necessary for the
pedestrian access to cross maneuvering aisles or internal roadways, the
crossings shall emphasize and place priority on pedestrian access and safety.
The pedestrian crossings must be well marked using such pavement treatments,
signs, striping, signals, lighting, pedestrian safety islands, landscaping,
and other traffic calming techniques.

§ 154.184  OUTDOOR STORAGE OF RECREATION VEHICLES.



   In all residential districts, a recreational vehicle may be parked or
stored subject to the following conditions.



   (A)   Storage or parking shall not be permitted on vacant lots or
parcels.

NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS



§ 154.195  INTENT.



   Certain existing lots, structures, and uses of lots and structures were
lawful before this chapter was adopted, but have become nonconformities under
the terms of this chapter and its amendments. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit such nonconformities to remain until they are discontinued
or removed, but not to encourage their survival or, where discontinuance or
removal is not feasible, to gradually upgrade such nonconformities to
conforming status. Nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded, or
extended, except as provided herein, and shall not be used as grounds for
adding other structures and uses of lots and structures which are prohibited.
Nonconformities are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with the
structures and uses permitted in the various districts.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)



§ 154.196  NONCONFORMING LOTS.



   (A)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.



   (B)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of
lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time
of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do
not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this
chapter, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purpose of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel or lot shall be
used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established
by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel or lot be made which
leaves remaining any parcel or lot with width or area below the requirements
stated in this chapter.

§ 154.197  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.



   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms
of the chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.



   (A)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.



   (B)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part
to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.



   (C)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases operation for more
than six consecutive months, or for 18 months during any three-year period,
any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by
this chapter for the district in which such land is located.

§ 154.198  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.



   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.



   (A)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.



   (B)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent
of more than 50% of replacement value at the time of destruction, it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.



   (C)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.

§ 154.199  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.



   If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.



   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.



   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any interior
part of a building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use,
and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but
no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.



   (C)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations pertaining to the uses permitted in the district
in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed. Section 154.198 of this section shall apply to any
nonconformity relating to the structure(s).



   (D)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases operation for more
than six consecutive months, or for 18 months during any three-year period,
any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by
the ordinance pertaining to the uses permitted in the district in which such
land is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from
this provision only so long as seasonal uses shall continue.



   (E)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.



   (F)   (1)   If no structural alterations are made, any
nonconforming use of structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to
another nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted classification
provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use.



      (2)   In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and
intent of this chapter.



      (3)   Where a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or
structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a more restrictive
classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted
classification.

   (A)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50% of the replacement value
of the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it

structure, or a structure containing a nonconforming use which is physically
unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, as determined by
the Building Official may be restored to a safe condition.



      (2)   Where enlargement or structural alternation is necessary

(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003)



§ 154.218  POWERS AND DUTIES.



   (A)   General. The Board has the power to act on matters as provided
in this chapter and Public Act 110 of 2006, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.3101 et
seq., as amended. The specific powers of the Board are enumerated in the
following divisions of this section.



   (B)   Voting.



      (1)   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the
Board shall be necessary to reverse an order, requirements, decision, or
determination of an administrative official or body, or to decide in favor of
the applicant a matter upon which the Board is required to pass under an
ordinance, or to effect a variation in an ordinance except that a concurring
vote of two-thirds of the members of the Board shall be necessary to grant a
variance from uses of land permitted in an ordinance.



      (2)   A member shall be disqualified from a vote in which a
conflict of interest exists. Failure of a member to disclose a conflict of
interest and be disqualified from a vote shall constitute malfeasance in
office.



   (C)   Administrative review. The Board shall hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order,
requirement, permit, decision, or refusal made by the Zoning Administrator or
other duly authorized enforcing agent, in enforcing any provision of this
chapter.



   (D)   Interpretation.



      (1)   The Board shall hear and decide requests for
interpretation of this chapter or the zoning map taking into consideration
the intent and purpose of the ordinance and the Master Plan.



      (2)   A record shall be kept by the Board of all decisions for
interpretation of this chapter or zoning map and land uses which are approved
under the terms of this section. The Board shall request the Planning
Commission to review any ordinance amendment it deems necessary.



   (E)   Variances.



      (1)   Upon an appeal, the Board is authorized to grant a
variance from the strict provisions of this chapter, whereby extraordinary or
exceptional conditions of such property, the strict application of the
regulations enacted would result in peculiar or exceptional practical
difficulties to, or exceptional undue hardship upon the owner of such
property provided such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to
the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of
this chapter. In granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto such
conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the
proposed uses as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this
chapter. Further, in granting a variance, the Board shall state the grounds
upon which it justifies the granting of a variance as outlined below. When
granting any variance, the Board must ensure that the spirit of the ordinance
is observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.



      (2)   The applicant must present evidence to show that if this
chapter is applied strictly, practical difficulties will result to the
applicant and that:



         (a)   The ordinance restrictions unreasonably prevent
the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose;



         (b)   The variance would do substantial justice to the
applicant as well as to other property owners in the district, and a lesser
relaxation than that requested would not give substantial relief to the owner
of the property or be more consistent with justice to other property owners;



         (c)   The plight of the landowner is due to the unique
circumstances of the property; and



         (d)   The alleged hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property.



(Ord. 285, passed 12-8-2003; Ord. 363, passed 6-8-2015)



§ 154.219  PROCEDURE FOR APPEAL.



   (A)   An applicant requesting any action by the Board shall commence
such request by filing a notice of appeal, on the form supplied by the city,
accompanied by such appeal fee as determined by the City Council, and all
plans, studies, and any other information and data as applicable, all of
which shall be made a part of the record.



   (B)   Any dimension variance requested within the city shall be
accompanied by a survey representing the dimension (distance and/or area)
which is deficient and nonconforming. The dimension shall be directly
measured and certified by a professional surveyor licensed to practice in the
state. As it relates to areas, the surveyor shall indicate all field measured
dimensions of such parcel and provide the representative calculation. As it
relates to property line setbacks or building separations, the dimensions
shall be a direct measurement versus calculated. This section may not require
a full property line survey of the entire parcel in question but does require
a survey as necessary to represent and support the variance request.



   (C)   Every appeal from a determination of the Zoning Administrator
or other duly authorized enforcing agent shall be made by the applicant
within 30 days of the date of the order issuance or refusal to issue permit,
requirement, or refusal.



   (D)   The Board shall fix a time for a hearing on the appeal, and
shall notify the applicant of the time and place of such hearing. Notice of
all public hearings conducted by the Board shall appear in a newspaper of
general circulation in the city at least 15 days prior to the hearing where
the appeal pertains to a specific parcel(s) of property. Notice of the public
hearing shall be sent to the persons to whom real property within 300 feet of
the premises in question is assessed, and to the occupants of single- and
two-family dwellings within 300 feet regardless of whether the owner or
occupant is located in the city, the notice to be delivered personally or by
mail addressed to the respective owners and tenants at the address given in
the last assessment roll. If the tenant’s name is not known, the term
“occupant” may be used.



   (E)   Any person may appear in person at the public hearing, or be
represented by an agent or attorney, and present any evidence in support of
his or her appeal. The Board of Appeals shall have the power to require the
attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, compel testimony, and otherwise
cause the production of books, papers, files, and other evidence pertaining
to matters properly coming before the Board of Appeals.



   (F)   The Board shall not decide an appeal until after a public
hearing.



   (G)   The Board may reverse, affirm, vary, or modify, any order,
requirement, or determination, as to which it has the power to consider, and
have all the powers of the officer or body from whom the appeal was taken and
may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.



   (H)   (1)   The Board may impose conditions with any decision.
Such conditions imposed shall meet all of the following requirements:



         (a)   Be designed to protect natural resources, public
health, safety, and welfare and the social and economic well being of those
who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents, and
landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the
community as a whole;



         (b)   Be related to the valid exercise of the police
power, and purposes, which are affected by the proposed use or activity; and



         (c)   Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of
this chapter, be related to the standards established in the ordinance for
the land use or activity under consideration, and be necessary to ensure
compliance with those standards.



      (2)   Violations of any of these conditions shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, enforceable as such, and/or may be grounds for
revocation or reversal of such decision.



   (I)   All decisions of the Board shall be in writing and so far as
it is practicable, in the form of a general statement or resolution reciting
the conditions, facts, and findings of the Board. The applicant shall be
advised of the decision after the public hearing unless the Board moves for a
continuation of such hearing.



   (J)   Any decision of the Board favorable to the applicant shall
remain valid only as long as the information or data relating thereto are
found to be correct, and the conditions upon which the decision was based are
maintained.



   (K)   The Board may reconsider an earlier decision if, in the
opinion of the Board, circumstances justify taking such action.



   (L)   (1)   No order of the Board of Appeals permitting the
erection or alteration of a building shall be valid for a period of longer
than one year, unless a building permit for such erection or alteration is
obtained within such period, and such erection or alteration is started and
proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.



      (2)   No order of the Board of Appeals permitting a use of a
building or premises shall be valid for a period longer than one year, unless
such use is established within such period; provided, however, that such
order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said
erection or alteration is obtained within such period, and such erection or
alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with such
permit.



   (M)   Any party aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Board of
Appeals may appeal to the circuit court in accordance with Public Act 110 of
2006, being M.C.L.A. §§ 125.3101 et seq., as amended.
