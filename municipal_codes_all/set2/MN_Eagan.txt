PREFACE 
This volume is a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Eagan, Minnesota, originally published in 1983. The original arrangement and the original numbering system have been retained. New state law references have been added and existing references were verified and updated. A state law reference table was prepared. In this publication, a uniform style of punctuation and capitalization has been employed. Obvious typographical errors and misspellings have been corrected without notation. 
Source materials used in the preparation of this Code were the 1983 publication, as amended, a legal analysis of the 1983 publication, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a point. The figure before the point refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the point refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.02, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6.01. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6.01 and 6.02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6.01.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

The following paragraphs are reprinted from the Foreword of the 1983 publication: 
This book contains a codification of the ordinances of the City of Eagan pursuant to authority granted the City Council by Minnesota Statutes, Section 415.021. It is known and may be cited as the "City Code". 
In this codification, most of the original ordinances have lost their identity and are referred to by Chapter, Section, Subdivision, etc. rather than by a number indicating the sequence in which they were adopted. They have also been supplemented by other essential legislative items. Certain ordinances retain their number and effective dates because of the nature of the subject matter contained therein. 
A complete codification of the proportions desired is a difficult and lengthy task, but the effort will be well-rewarded if it is found that the City Code accomplishes (1) the elimination of repetition and non-essentials; (2) easy revision and incorporation of each new ordinance or amendment; (3) comprehensiveness; and, (4) the ease of locating a particular subject or provision. 
The reader will find in this book a topical Analysis and a Sub-Analysis, followed by a full text of the City Code. This physical layout is designed to make local laws more accessible to the layman for it is closest to him and touches his life every day. The City Code is dedicated to this purpose.

Such request shall contain a general statement setting forth the administrative decision to be challenged by the appellant. At such hearing the appellant may present any evidence he deems pertinent to the appeal, but the city shall not be required to keep a verbatim record of the proceedings. The mayor or other officer presiding at the hearing may, in the interest of justice or to comply with time requirements and on his own motion or the motion of the appellant, the city administrator, or a member of the council, adjourn the hearing to a more convenient time or place, but such time or place shall be fixed and determined before adjournment so as to avoid the necessity for formal notice of reconvening.

Vehicles on the premises of junkyards or automobile graveyards that are defined, maintained and licensed in accordance with Minn. Stat. § 161.242 or that are licensed and maintained in accordance with local laws and zoning regulations are not considered abandoned vehicles.

D.  Notice.

2.  The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any, of the abandoned motor vehicle and to all readily identifiable lienholders of record.

From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle, the city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle and all administrative, notice and publication costs incurred pursuant to this subdivision.

2.  Where the city enters into a contract with a person duly licensed by the state pollution control agency, the agency shall review the contract to determine whether it conforms to the agency's plan for solid waste disposal. A contract that does so conform may be approved by the agency. Where a contract has been approved, the agency may reimburse the city for the costs incurred under the contract which have not been reimbursed. 
3.  If the city utilizes its own equipment and personnel for disposal of the abandoned motor vehicle, it shall be entitled to reimbursement for the cost thereof along with its other costs as herein provided.

If the city administrator knows the identity and whereabouts of the owner, he shall serve written notice upon the owner at least 30 days prior to a declaration of abandonment by the council. If the city acquired possession from a prior holder, the identity and whereabouts of whom are known by the city administrator, notice shall also be served upon such prior holder. Such notice shall describe the property and state that unless it is claimed and proof of ownership or entitlement to possession established, the matter of declaring it abandoned property will be brought to the attention of the council after the expiration of 30 days from the date of such notice. 
C.  Notice and disposal of tangible property. Except as provided otherwise for certain other tangible property, upon adoption of a resolution declaring tangible property to be abandoned property, the city administrator shall publish a notice thereof describing the same, together with the names, if known, and addresses, if known, of prior owners and holders thereof and including a brief description of such property.

Subd. 8. Extension for filing or payment.

If no such action is taken by the council, such increase or increases shall take effect on the date stated in the franchisee's petition as though approved by the council. 
Subd. 3.  Prior to the hearing date, the franchisee shall, without delay, comply with the city's reasonable requests for examination and copying of all books, records, documents and other information relating to the subject matter of the petition. Should the franchisee unreasonably delay, fail or refuse such requests, the same shall be grounds for a continuance of the hearing date. 
Subd. 4.  Notice of hearing shall be in the form and manner stated in the resolution. At the hearing all persons wishing to be heard thereon shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity. Findings and a decision shall be made by the council within 15 days after the hearing and served upon the franchisee.

Secs. 3.093.19. - Reserved.  
Sec. 3.20. - Rules and regulations relating to water service. 
Subd. 1.  Deficiency of water and shutting off water. The city is not liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of water to customers, whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making repairs or connections or by any other cause whatever. In case of fire or alarm of fire, water may be shut off to insure a supply for firefighting. In making repairs or construction of new works, water may be shut off at any time and kept off so long as may be necessary. 
Subd. 2.  Repair of leaks. It is the responsibility of the consumer or owner to maintain the service pipe from the curbstop into the house or other building. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or owner to repair any leak occurring in his service pipe within 24 hours after oral or written notice has been given the owner or occupant of the premises, the water may be shut off and will not be turned on until a reconnection charge has been paid and the water service has been repaired. When the waste of water is great or when damage is likely to result from the leak, the water will be turned off if the repair is not proceeded with immediately. 
Subd. 3.  Abandoned services penalties. All service installations connected to the water system that have been abandoned or, for any reason, have become useless for further service shall be disconnected at the main. The owner of the premises served by this service, shall pay the cost of the excavation. The city shall perform the actual disconnection, and all pipe and appurtenances removed from the street right-of-way shall become the property of the city. When new buildings are erected on the site of old ones and it is desired to increase the old water service, a new permit shall be taken out, and the regular tapping charge shall be made as if this were a new service. It is unlawful for any person to cause or allow any service pipe to be hammered or squeezed together at the ends to stop the flow of water, or to save expense in improperly removing such pipe from the main. Also, such improper disposition thereof shall be corrected by the city, and the cost incurred shall be borne by the person causing or allowing such work to be performed. 
Subd. 4.  Service pipes. Every service pipe must be laid in such manner as to prevent rupture by settlement. The service pipe shall be placed not less than seven feet below the surface in all cases so arranged as to prevent rupture and stoppage by freezing. Frozen service pipes between the curbstop and the building shall be the responsibility of the owner. Service pipes must extend from the curbstops to the inside of the building, or if not taken into a building then to the hydrant or other fixtures which they are intended to supply. A valve, the same size as the service pipe, shall be placed close to the inside wall of the building, ahead of the meter and well protected from freezing and at the property or public utility easement line flush with the finished grade or surface elevation and fully accessible and operable by city authorized personnel. Joints on copper tubing shall be flared and kept to a minimum. Not more than one joint shall be used for a service up to 70 feet in length. All joints shall be left uncovered until inspected. Minimum size connection with the water mains shall be three-fourths inch in diameter. 
Subd. 5.  Private water supplies. No water pipe of the city water system shall be connected with any pump, well, pipe, tank or any device that is connected with any other source of water supply, and when such are found, the city shall notify the owner or occupant to disconnect the same and, if not immediately done, the city water shall be turned off. Before any new connections to the city system are permitted, the city shall ascertain that no cross connections will exist when the new connection is made. When a building is connected to "city water" the private water supply may be used only for such purposes as the city may allow. 
Subd. 6.  Restricted hours for sprinkling. Whenever the city shall determine that a shortage of water threatens the city, it may limit the times and hours during which water may be used from the city water system for lawn and garden sprinkling, irrigation, car washing, air conditioning, and other uses, or either or any of them. It is unlawful for any water consumer to cause or permit water to be used in violation of such determination after public announcement thereof has been made through the news media specifically indicating the restrictions thereof. 
Subd. 7.  Private fire hose connections. Owners of structures with self-contained fire protection systems may apply for and obtain permission to connect the street mains with hydrants, large pipes, and hose couplings, for use in case of fire only, at their own installation expense and at such rates as the council may adopt by resolution as herein provided. 
Subd. 8.  Water hydrant use. 
A.  Opening hydrants. It is unlawful for any person, other than members of the fire department or other person duly authorized by the city, in pursuance of lawful purpose, to open any fire hydrant or attempt to draw water from the same or in any manner interfere therewith, without first obtaining a permit therefor from the city. It is also unlawful for any person so authorized to deliver or suffer to be delivered to any other person any hydrant key or wrench, except for the purposes strictly pertaining to their lawful use. A separate permit shall be required, in addition to all required fees and deposits, for each separate water hydrant to be used. 
B.  Permit application and fee. An application for a permit hereunder shall be filed with the city clerk upon an application form furnished by the city. The application shall include, but not be limited to, the name and address of the applicant and the person signing the application, the location of the proposed water hydrant to be used and the reason for the applicant's connection to or use of the water hydrant. The fee for a permit hereunder shall be established by the council, by resolution, from time to time.

The deposits shall be returned to the applicant only after compliance with the following conditions: 
1.  The meter and other equipment provided to the applicant has been returned to the city undamaged and in proper working order. The deposit shall be forfeited in an amount equal to the costs incurred by the city to repair or replace the damaged meter or other equipment.

2.  Payment of all delinquent or unpaid water use charges accumulated to the date of the termination of the temporary water usage from the water hydrant. 
3.  The water hydrant is undamaged and in proper working order. The deposit shall be forfeited to the extent equal to the costs incurred by the city to repair or replace the damaged water hydrant. 
F.  Water emergency restrictions. The city shall have the right to cancel a permit issued hereunder without prior notice when a water emergency within the city requires such action.

2.  Inspections. All private water hydrants within the city shall be subject to an annual inspection and an inspection after each operation. Inspections may be conducted by the city or a person qualified in water hydrant maintenance ("qualified person"). 
If the inspection is to be conducted by the city, the property owner shall complete and submit to the city's public works a signed consent form as prescribed by the city. The property owner shall be charged an inspection fee for each water hydrant inspected by the city on a per occurrence basis and in an amount adopted by city council resolution. The inspection fee shall be included on the property owner's municipal utility billing statement. 
If the inspection is conducted by a qualified person, the property owner shall be responsible for submitting to the city's public works a certificate of compliance that is completed and signed by the qualified person. The certificate of compliance shall be on a form provided by the city. 
3.  Maintenance and repair . If upon inspection it is determined a water hydrant is not in good repair, does not operate as designed, or is otherwise in need of maintenance or repair, the property owner shall, in a timely manner, have the necessary maintenance, repair or replacement completed.

Subd. 12.  Additional rules and regulations. The council may, by resolution, adopt such additional rules and regulations relating to placement, size and type of equipment as it, in its discretion, deems necessary or desirable. Copies of such additional rules and regulations shall be kept on file in the office of the city administrator, and uniformly enforced. 
Subd. 13.  Cross connection with municipal water utility system regulations.

Subd. 2.  Metered water not discharged. If a portion of the water furnished to any premises is not directly or indirectly discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of such water shall be deducted in computing the sewerage service charge or rental, provided a separate meter shall be installed and operated to register the quantity not so discharged into the sewer system. Provided also, that where it is not practicable to meter the portion of the water not discharged into the sewer system, such adjustment may be made as shall be fair and equitable in order to determine the amount of such service charge or rental; but until such adjustment shall be effected that water consumption basis hereinbefore prescribed shall remain in full force and effect. 
Subd. 3.  Classification of industrial wastes. The city shall have the power to classify the industrial wastes from any lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharged therefrom into the sewer system of the city, taking into consideration the quantity of sewage produced and its concentration, strength of river pollution qualities in general and of any other factors entering into the cost of its disposal, for the purpose of fixing and prescribing a distinct rate of rental or use charge, should it be found that as to such sewer uses the water basis consumption does not provide a practicable method in the premises, but until so determined and such distinct rate fixed, the water consumption basis hereinbefore prescribed shall remain in full force and effect as to such commercial or industrial users.

The monthly surcharge for a re-connection will be charged for each month beginning with the month in which the inspection was completed or a certificate of compliance was filed confirming the previous disconnection through the end of the month in which the reconnection is subsequently disconnected. 
F.  Temporary waiver. The city may grant a temporary waiver from the provisions of this section where strict enforcement would cause a threat of damage or harm to other property, the environment, or public safety because of circumstances unique to the individual property or due to weather conditions. A written request for a temporary waiver must be first submitted to the public works director specifying the reasons for the temporary waiver. If a temporary waiver is granted, the property owner shall pay an additional fee for sewerage service charges based on the number of gallons discharged into the city's (sanitary) sewer system as estimated by the public works director. The additional sewerage service charge fee shall be twice the rate of the base sewage service charge multiplied by the number of estimated gallons of clear water discharge. 
The public works director may set conditions to the temporary waiver. The public works director may terminate the temporary waiver upon a failure to comply with any conditions imposed on the temporary waiver.

Sec. 4.34. - Stormwater management regulations. 
A.  Findings and purpose statement. The city council finds it is in the best interest of the City of Eagan to protect, preserve, and enhance the city's natural resources of its and the region's water bodies, its stormwater system and public and private lands as may be adversely affected by the alteration to and the development of land within the city. Unmanaged stormwater runoff from land disturbing activities and increased development of land within the city have significant adverse impacts upon local and regional water resources diminishing the quality thereof and the public health, safety, and welfare of its residents as follows: 
1.  Increased runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening the city's storm sewers, drainage ways and other storm drainage systems. 
2.  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, toxics, debris, bacteria, pathogens, biological impairments, thermal stress and other pollutants. 
3.  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures. 
4.  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding. 
5.  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads. 
6.  Impact groundwater by reducing recharge and increasing potential pollutant loading. 
To address these public health, safety and welfare concerns, the purpose of this section is to establish regulations that control and manage stormwater runoff from land that is subject to land disturbing activity and/or development, whether new or redevelopment, that will: 
1.  Meet Minimum Impact Standards (MID) performance goals. 
2.  Assist in meeting NPDES/SDS Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) and Construction Stormwater General Permit requirements. 
3.  Assist in meeting Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan wasteload allocations for impaired waters through quantification of load reductions. 
4.  Protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding. 
5.  Protect public and private property and natural resources from damage resulting from stormwater runoff and erosion. 
6.  Ensure the annual stormwater runoff rates and volumes from post development conditions mimic and/or reduce the annual runoff rates and volumes from predevelopment site conditions. 
7.  Ensure site design minimizes the generation of stormwater and maximizes pervious areas for stormwater treatment. 
8.  Provide a single, consistent set of performance goals that apply to all developments. 
9.  Protect water quality from pollutant loadings of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, toxics, debris, bacteria, pathogens, biological impairments, thermal stress and other pollutants. 
10.  Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge. 
11.  Provide vegetated corridors (buffers) to protect water resources from development. 
12.  Protect functional values of all types of natural water bodies (e.g., rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, seasonal ponds). 
13.  Sustain or enhance biodiversity (native plant and animal habitat) and support riparian ecosystems. 
B.  Authorization and Scope. 
1.  Statutory Authorization. This section is adopted pursuant to federal regulations under the Clean Water Act and the Minnesota Rules administered under the stormwater regulatory program by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. 
2.  Scope. This section applies to and a stormwater management permit is required hereunder for any one of the following:

(d)  Issuance of a building permit where a building is demolished in whole regardless if the new building or improvements create equal to or less than the impervious surface than that existed prior to demolition; 
(e)  Issuance of a building permit where a building is demolished in part, but the new building or improvements on the site create more impervious surface than that existing prior to demolition; 
(f)  Land disturbing activity as defined in this section, including excavations regulated in Chapter 4 of this Code; or 
(g)  Any activity that creates 10,000 square feet or more of new or fully reconstructed impervious surface on an individual lot of record or in aggregate on one or more lots of record if activity is part of a single project. 
When a building or grading permit is issued in connection with a project or a new development, redevelopment, or subdivision project is approved by the city council as required in this Code, the building or grading permit or the new development, redevelopment, or subdivision approval by the city may be in lieu of the stormwater management permit required hereunder, provided the applicant shall comply with all regulations herein and all conditions required under the separate permits or approvals.

F.  Post-construction stormwater management requirements. In connection with any project for which a permit is required under this section that results in the addition of 10,000 square feet or more of impervious surface on the site, the following post-construction/activity stormwater management requirements shall be met on the site: 
1.  Stormwater volume control. 
a.  New, nonlinear developments. For a new, nonlinear development that creates 10,000 square feet or more of new impervious surface on sites without infiltration restrictions, stormwater runoff volumes shall be controlled and the post-construction runoff volume shall be retained on the site for 1.1 inches of runoff from impervious surfaces, (i.e., the volume retained shall be 1.1 inches times the impervious surface without any abstractions/losses). 
b.  Redevelopment/reconstruction projects. Nonlinear redevelopment projects on sites without infiltration restrictions that create 10,000 square feet or more of new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces shall capture and retain on site 1.1 inches of runoff from new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces. 
c.  Linear Projects. Linear projects (roadways, sidewalks, and trails) without infiltration restrictions and not part of another project that creates 10,000 square feet or more of new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces shall capture and retain the larger of the following: 
(1)  0.55 inches of runoff from the new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces; or 
(2)  1.1 inches of runoff from the net increase in impervious area. 
For linear projects where the lack of right-of-way precludes the installation of volume control practices that meet the conditions for post-construction stormwater management in this section, and a reasonable attempt has been made to obtain right-of-way during the project planning process, the applicant shall follow the flexible treatment options schedule. 
d.  Pretreatment shall be provided for all volume control BMPs. 
e.  No areas of constructed wet ponds or wetlands shall be accepted as an infiltration practice. 
f.  Impervious surface area for calculating post-construction volume control requirement shall include all disturbed/graded soil areas that are proposed to be revegetated pervious surfaces, due to soil compaction impacts from land disturbance. Identification of soil management strategies to be utilized, within a stormwater management plan and site plans, may provide exclusion to this disturbed pervious provision for areas shown to protect and restore soil permeability to non-compacted soil conditions, if approved by the city engineer. 
g.  Acceptable credit calculator and/or modeling. Final site design and choice of stormwater treatment practices shall be based on outcomes of the MIDS calculator, or other water quality modeling as accepted by the city, to demonstrate compliance with the volume control performance goals, as part of a stormwater management plan. 
h.  Reference design guide. All volume control for water quality and quantity and site design specifications shall conform to the current versions of the MPCA Minnesota Stormwater Manual and the City of Eagan stormwater design guide. 
2.  Permissible alternative stormwater volume control designs. 
a.  The city may consider and permit alternative stormwater management designs if the city, in its sole conclusion, determines that the applicant cannot fully meet the requirements as set forth in this section, due to infiltration restrictions. Before the city will consider any alternative design, the applicant shall demonstrate that it cannot fully comply with the standards herein. The city will consider the merits of relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. 
Applicant shall document the alternative design options sequence starting with Alternative #1. If Alternative #1 cannot be met, then Alternative #2 shall be analyzed. Applicant must document the specific reasons why Alternative #1 cannot be met based on the infiltration restriction factors listed below. If Alternative #2 cannot be met then Alternative #3 shall be met. Applicant must document the specific reasons why Alternative #2 cannot be met based on the infiltration restriction factors listed below. When all of the conditions are fulfilled within an alternative, this sequence is completed. 
Volume reduction techniques considered in determining alternative designs shall include infiltration, reuse and rainwater harvesting, and/or additional techniques included in the MIDS calculator, the Minnesota Stormwater Manual, or the City of Eagan stormwater design guide. Higher priority shall be given to BMPs that include volume reduction. Secondary preference is to employ filtration techniques, followed by rate control BMPs. 
b.  The use of infiltration as a stormwater management method is prohibited when the infiltration device will be constructed in any of the following areas: 
(1)  Where industrial facilities are not authorized to infiltrate industrial stormwater under an NPDES/SDS industrial stormwater permit issued by the MPCA. 
(2)  Where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur. 
(3)  With less than three feet of separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or to the top of bedrock. 
(4)  Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater will be mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater. 
c.  The use of infiltration as a stormwater management method is restricted for post-construction stormwater management, without higher engineering review sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and prevent adverse impacts to groundwater, when the infiltration device will be constructed in any of the following areas: 
(1)  With predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay) soils. 
(2)  Within 1,000 feet up-gradient, or 100 feet down-gradient of active karst features. 
(3)  Within a Drinking Water Supply Management Area (DWSMA). 
(4)  Where soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour. 
The restrictions above do not prohibit the applicant from infiltrating stormwater; instead, the restrictions require that a higher level of design and review are required. 
d.  The alternative stormwater management design options sequence is as follows: 
Alternative #1: Applicant must first attempt to design the site to achieve retention of at least 0.55 inches of runoff from the proposed impervious surfaces and remove 75 percent of the annual total phosphorus load leaving all points of the site. Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. 
Alternative #2: If the Applicant cannot achieve the standards listed in Alternative #1, the project shall achieve volume reduction to the maximum extent practicable and remove 60 percent of the annual total phosphorus load leaving all points on the site. Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. 
Alternative #3: Off-site treatment. Mitigation equivalent to the performance of 1.1 inches of volume reduction for new development or redevelopment as described in this section performed off-site to protect the receiving water body may be considered/accepted by the city (including payment to be used on public stormwater volume reduction projects) on a case-by-case basis. Off-site treatment shall be achieved in areas selected, and if approved by the city, in the following order of preference: 
(1)  Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity. 
(2)  Locations within the same city small sub basin as the original construction activity. 
(3)  Locations within the same city water quality major drainage basin. 
(4)  Locations anywhere within the city. 
3.  Runoff rate control. All on-site rate-control stormwater facilities required under this section shall be designed, installed, and maintained to accomplish the following: 
a.  Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the 50 percent probability, 24-hour storm event. 
b.  Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the ten percent probability, 24-hour storm event. At a minimum, the storm sewer system shall be designed for the ten percent, 24-hour storm event. Low areas must have an acceptable overland drainage route with the required transfer capacity when the event is exceeded. 
c.  Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the one percent probability, 24-hour storm event. 
d.  Where the city's stormwater management plan and its updates show lower rates for the 50 percent, ten percent, or one percent events, this lower rate shall supersede the predevelopment rate control criteria. 
All storm events calculations shall be modeled according to the most current version of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service Atlas 14, using rainfall events applicable to the city. All runoff calculations shall be according to the methodology described in the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Technical Release 55, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" (commonly referred to as TR-55). Other methodology may be used with prior approval by the city. Curve numbers for each land use shall be chosen based on TR-55, except that under no circumstances shall predevelopment pre-project conditions exceed a curve number of 72. The city retains the right to review the appropriateness of the curve number applied to a property. 
For post-construction Rate Control modeling a minimum curve number of 84 shall be used on all disturbed/graded soil areas that are proposed to be revegetated pervious surfaces, due to soil compaction impacts from land disturbance. Identification of soil management strategies to be utilized, within a stormwater management plan and site plans, may provide justification for use of a lower curve number for pervious areas if shown to protect or restore soil permeability to non-compacted soil conditions, if approved by the city Engineer. 
All rate control practice designs shall conform to the current versions of the MPCA Minnesota Stormwater Manual and the City of Eagan stormwater design guide (e.g., pond design standards including maximum side slopes, maintenance bench, safety bench, unobstructed equipment access, etc.). 
On-site rate control practices may not be needed if the applicant is able to clearly demonstrate that off-site (regional) constructed facilities can detain/retain the project site's runoff rates to pre-development conditions and in accordance with the rates established in this Code. In this case, the applicant shall submit a technical evaluation completed by a qualified engineer or hydrologist which must be reviewed and approved by the city engineer. 
4.  Flood and erosion control. No land shall be developed or no use shall be permitted that results in water runoff causing flooding (drainage in excess of the natural drainage anticipated by the city stormwater management plan) or erosion or sedimentation on adjacent property. 
5.  Use of natural topography and better site design techniques. The applicant shall reduce the need for stormwater management infrastructure/facilities, public or private, by utilizing natural topography and land cover such as swales and depressions that exist before development to the degree they can accommodate the additional flow of water without compromising the integrity or quality of a receiving water body. Development or redevelopment shall minimize impact to significant natural features. Projects shall be designed using the Better Site Design Techniques of the current version of the Minnesota Stormwater Manual. Better Site Design involves techniques applied early in the design process to preserve natural areas, reduce impervious cover, distribute runoff and use pervious areas to more effectively treat stormwater runoff. Site design should address open space protection, impervious cover minimization, runoff distribution and minimization, and runoff utilization. 
G.  Oil and grease control. The first 0.5 inches of runoff shall be treated using effective oil and grease removal technology. Site must provide oil and grease control when the site has 40 or more parking stalls, has high traffic areas (such as drive thru windows/lanes), or commercial/business activities will take place that have the potential for oil and/or grease pollution (e.g., gas/service stations). 
H.  Outlets. Stormwater discharges from new construction project sites shall have a stable outlet capable of carrying stormwater flow at a non-erosive velocity. The outlet shall be designed considering flow capacity and flow duration. The outlet design requirement applies to both the discharge outlet from the construction site, as well as the discharge outlet into the municipal storm sewer system or water body. 
I.  Maintenance of private stormwater facilities. Property owners shall maintain all private stormwater facilities that have been installed in accordance with this section in proper and operational condition consistent with the performance standards under which they were originally designed and pursuant to the terms of the city's approval of the facility(s), in addition to the following: 
1.  On an annual basis, unless the city requires more frequency, the property owners shall: (a) have the private stormwater facility(s) inspected by a qualified person with demonstrated experience in construction and maintenance of stormwater infiltration practices, to determine the facility is properly maintained and in operational condition consistent with the performance standards for which it was originally designed and approved by the city; and (b) inspect and remove and properly dispose of all settled materials, including all settled solids, from sumps, grit chambers, and other devices within all private stormwater facilities, in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. The city may grant one- to five-year waivers from this requirement after the property owner presents evidence that a facility has the capacity to store settled solids in accordance with the original design capacity. 
2.  When requested by the city, property owners shall provide a maintenance plan that defines who will conduct the maintenance, the type of maintenance that will be conducted, and the maintenance intervals of a private stormwater facility. 
3.  All private stormwater facilities shall be designed to minimize the need for maintenance and to provide easy vehicle and personnel access for maintenance purposes, and shall be structurally sound, as determined by the city. Prior to city approval, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the facilities for inspection or maintenance. 
4.  The city shall have the right to request and review inspection and maintenance records and shall have the right to perform an inspection of private stormwater facilities at any time if the city has probable cause to believe that the facilities are not being properly maintained or inspected., to ensure continued operation of the facilities in accordance with the design and maintenance plans. 
5.  If the site is subject to subsequent land disturbing activity or building construction or stormwater treatment facilities change, causing decreased effectiveness of the stormwater treatment, new or modified structural stormwater BMPs must be implemented to achieve compliance with the performance standards and requirements of this section. 
6.  Prior to the issuance of a permit hereunder, the property owner shall execute a stormwater management system agreement governing the implementation, inspection and maintenance of the stormwater management facilities required and approved by the city under this section. The fully executed agreement shall be recorded with the Dakota County recorder's office, at the property owner's sole expense, within 30 days of the issuance of the permit. 
J.  Enforcement. 
1.  Whenever the city finds that a person has violated a provision or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the city may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. 
2.  If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property are required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such abatement and/or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to abate or restore the property within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a third party contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
3.  If the violator fails to pay for said services within 30 days of the notice of the amount due, the city may draw the amount owed for the services from any financial guarantees the city may hold with regard to the affected property. On or before the first day of September of each year, the city clerk shall list the total unpaid charges for abatement and/or restoration services against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable under this article. 
4.  Every person violates a requirement, subdivision, paragraph or provision of this section when he fails to perform an act as required hereunder, or performs an act thereby prohibited or declared unlawful and, upon conviction thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and sentenced in accordance therewith except as otherwise stated in specific provisions hereof. 
K.  Appeals of decisions. The applicant may appeal any requirement, decision or determination by the city in connection with any provision of this section pursuant to the procedures as set forth in the zoning regulations regarding board of appeals and adjustments. 
L.  Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 
1.  Emergency work necessary to protect life, limb, or property. 
2.  Routine agricultural activity such as tilling, planting, harvesting, and associated activities. Other agricultural activities are not exempt including activities such as feedlots, storage sheds, and construction of structures. 
3.  Silvicultural activity. 
4.  Public utility and right-of-way installation and maintenance projects, which are regulated elsewhere in the City Code; 
5.  Stockpiles: 1) clean aggregate stockpiles, 2) sand stockpiles, 3) constructed base components of roads, parking lots, 4) demolition concrete. Stockpiles must still be compliant with sediment control practices. 
M.  Compliance with plan. 
1.  Compliance required. The applicant shall implement and comply with the land disturbance plan (LDP) prior to and during any construction or land disturbing activity under the grading permit to which this section applies. All erosion and sedimentation control and tree preservation measures required under the plan shall be properly installed and remain in place until all grading and construction activity is completed and final stabilization has occurred or until a written request for removal of the protection measures is made to and approved by the city. Permanent erosion control and stormwater management shall remain in place after construction, and shall be under a long-term maintenance agreement which must be signed by the applicant before a grading permit is issued. The applicant/owner shall be responsible for inspections and maintenance of temporary and permanent BMPs on the site. No construction or land disturbing activity to which this section applies or removal of any significant trees may occur until the LDP is approved by the city and except in accordance with the approved LDP. Failure to comply with the approved terms and conditions of an LDP shall constitute a violation of this Code. To remain in compliance the applicant must amend the SWPPP as necessary to include additional or modified BMPs designed to correct problems identified or address erosion, sedimentation and/or construction debris/waste control issues, and shall keep all site plans (and Stormwater Management Plan documentation) up to date with regard to stormwater runoff controls, which shall be provided to the city. 
2.  Determination of compliance. The city shall have the right to enter and inspect the subject property in order to determine compliance with the approved LDP. The city shall have the right to order the suspension of any grading or construction activity on the subject property until compliance with the LDP has occurred. 
3.  Finding of noncompliance. Upon a finding of noncompliance, the city shall use the following procedure with respect to notification and corrective measures: 
(a)  The city shall personally serve upon the project manager and/or operator, or other responsible person, and by electronic mail (or certified U.S. mail) upon the applicant/property owner, if different than the project manager and/or operator, a written notification of the violation of the approved LDP. 
(b)  If remedial work is not completed and compliance with the LDP has not occurred within 48 hours of service of the violation notification, the city may complete remedial or corrective work and any costs incurred in connection with taking remedial action or installing corrective measures may be recovered from the applicant as allowed by law. In the alternative, the city may choose to issue a stop work order, withhold the scheduling of inspections, and/or the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, or revoke any construction-related permit and order the termination of all construction activity on the subject property until the subject site is in compliance with the LDP. 
N.  Emergency corrective actions. In the event circumstances exist such that noncompliance poses an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare, as determined by the city, the city may take emergency corrective action to prevent any such danger. The city shall take reasonable action to contact and direct the owner of the subject property to take any necessary action. Any costs incurred by the city in connection with any emergency action may be assessed to the property as allowed by Minn. Stats. § 429.101. 
O.  Conflict with other laws. If the requirements of this section are in conflict with any other federal, state or local law, the stricter requirements shall be enforced. 
P.  Final "as-built" grade plan. Upon completion of final stabilization, under a permit or other approvals issued under this section, an "as-built" grading plan shall be required. This paragraph shall not apply to any single lot building permit project on a R-1, R-2 and Estate zoned property not in connection with a new development and not resulting in the addition of 10,000 square feet or more of new impervious surface on the site. The "as-built" grading plan shall depict the actual field grade conditions of the subject property, lot drainage patterns and locations and elevations of all surface and subsurface stormwater facilities and other utilities, and depict any changes from the original land disturbance plan submitted to and approved by the city hereunder. If building permits are requested prior to completion of the "as-built" grading plan, "as-built" grading plans shall be required for the individual lots associated with those building permits. All "as-built" grading plans shall be signed by a professional engineer licensed by the State of Minnesota, certifying the "as built" plan complies with the city approved plans under the permit issued hereunder and submitted to the city in a format as required by the city. 
Q.  Tree preservation requirements. Removal or loss of significant trees shall be in accordance with the city approved LDP and the tree preservation regulations in chapter 11 of this Code. 
R.  Fees. Fees associated with this section shall be set by a duly adopted resolution by city council. 
S.  Performance security.

All applications shall be subject to a criminal background investigation. 
Subd. 2.  False statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to intentionally make a false statement or omission upon any application form.

Subd. 3.  Application and investigation fees. At the time of the initial application, an applicant for an on-sale liquor, wine or beer license or off-sale liquor or beer license shall pay to the city the sum of $500.00 as a non-refundable base application and investigation fee. An additional fee of $200.00 for each person or entity beyond five having an interest in the proposed licensed establishment shall be required.

Subd. 4.  Action. 
A.  Granting. The council may approve any application for the period of the remainder of the then-current license year or for the entire ensuing license year. All applications including proposed license periods must be consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a license, the applicant shall pay the license fee and, if applicable, pay the investigation fee. Upon rejection of any application for a license or upon withdrawal of an application before approval of the issuance by the council, the license fee shall be refunded to the applicant. Failure to pay any portion of a fee when due shall be cause for revocation. 
B.  Issuing. If an application is approved, the city clerk-treasurer shall forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the city or the proper department of the state, as the case may be, and upon payment of the license fee. All licenses shall be on a calendar-year basis unless otherwise specified herein. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other than on the first day of the license year, the fee to be paid with the application shall be a pro rata share of the annual license fee. Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the premises therein described. 
C.  License refund in certain cases. A pro rata share of an annual license fee for a license to sell liquor or beer, either on-sale or off-sale, shall be refunded to the licensee or to his estate, if: (1) the business ceases to operate because of destruction or damage; (2) the licensee dies; (3) the business ceases to be lawful for a reason other than a license revocation or suspension; or (4) the licensee ceases to carry on the licensed business under the license. 
D.  Transfer. No license shall be transferable between persons or to a different location. Any change in individual ownership or substitution of partners is a transfer. However, a change in corporate name of a beer licensee shall not be considered a transfer if at least 90 percent of the issued and outstanding shares are in the same ownership as at the time of original application and section 5.05 has not been violated. It is unlawful to make any transfer in violation of this subparagraph. 
E.  Refusal and termination. The council may, in its sole discretion and for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall be granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation. Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation. 
F.  Violation. For this section, a violation shall be defined as any failure to comply with a statute, regulation or provision of the City Code relating to alcoholic beverages. An officer of the police department or an agent of the state liquor control commission who becomes aware of a violation, regardless of whether any action is taken to issue an oral or written warning, a citation or a complaint, shall prepare a written report of the violation. One copy of the report shall be given to the chief of police, the licensee, and the city clerk, respectively. A violation by an officer, employee or agent of the licensee shall be deemed to be a violation by the licensee. 
G.  Penalty. Upon a finding that the licensee has sold alcoholic beverages to another retail licensee for the purpose of resale; purchased alcoholic beverages from another retail licensee for the purposes of resale; conducted or permitted the conduct of gambling on the licensed premises in violation of the law; failed to remove or dispose of alcoholic beverages when ordered by the commissioner to do so under Minnesota Statutes; or failed to comply with any other applicable state statute or rule, or Code provision herein relating to alcoholic beverages, a civil penalty of $500.00 for the first violation, $1,000.00 for the second violation within a 24-month period, $1,500.00 and a seven-day suspension of license for a third violation within a 24-month period, and $2,000.00 and a 30-day suspension of license for a fourth or more violation within a 36-month period shall be imposed upon the licensee who shall pay the civil penalty within 30 days of the date of a notice from the city. No suspension of a license or civil penalty imposed hereunder shall take effect until the licensee has been given an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer duly appointed by the city administrator as provided in this section. 
Any licensee found to have a fourth or more violation within a 36-month period shall appear for a hearing before the city council for consideration of revocation or additional days of suspension of the licensee's license. The city clerk shall set the date and time of the council's hearing for any regular council meeting. 
H.  [Failure to pay.] If the licensee fails to pay the civil penalty within 30 days of notice, the licensee's license shall be suspended until the civil penalty, plus any surcharge or interest for late payment, is paid in full. A licensee subject to suspension under this paragraph shall first have a right to a hearing before the hearing officer in accordance with the hearing provisions set forth herein, provided the exclusive issue for hearing is the suspension of license for nonpayment of the civil penalty. 
I.  Hearing. A hearing before the hearing officer shall be pursuant to the Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act. If the licensee files a request for hearing with the city clerk within ten business days of the date of the notice of the license action or civil penalty, the city clerk shall schedule a hearing before a hearing officer. In the event that the licensee fails to timely request a hearing or fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, the licensee shall be deemed to have waived his/her right to a hearing and shall be subject to the license action or civil penalties imposed hereunder. 
If the licensee timely requests a hearing, the hearing shall be held before the hearing officer within 14 days of the date the licensee files a request for hearing with the city clerk. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions as to whether a violation has occurred and the penalty imposed as authorized herein. Any hearing before the city council for consideration of additional penalties as prescribed herein shall be in addition and subsequent to any hearing before the hearing officer. 
Any appeal of the hearing officer's or city council's decision under this section shall be pursuant to a petition for writ of certiorari to the Minnesota Court of Appeals in accordance with Minnesota Statutes governing administrative procedures and the Minnesota Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure. 
J.  Additional restrictions. As additional restrictions or regulations on licensees under this chapter, and in addition to grounds for revocation or suspension stated in the City Code or statute, the following shall also be grounds for such action: (1) that the licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon licensed premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine or liquor; (2) that the licensee had knowledge of such illegal acts upon licensed premises, but failed to report the same to police; (3) that the licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully with police in investigating such alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises; or (4) that the activities of the licensee created a serious danger to public health, safety, or welfare. 
K.  Corporate applicants and licensees. A corporate applicant, at the time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of all persons that have an interest in such corporation and the extent of such interest.

Subd. 2. Applications and licenses under this chapterProcedure and administration. 
A.  Application. All applications shall be filed with the city clerk upon forms prescribed by the city, together with such information as required on the application form and as set forth herein. All questions asked or information required by the application forms shall be answered fully and completely by the applicant. All applications shall be subject to a criminal background investigation. 
B.  False statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to intentionally make a false statement or omission upon any application form. Any false statement in such application or any willful omission to state any information requested on the application form shall, upon discovery of such falsehood, be grounds for denial of a license or, if already issued, shall render the license issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect immediately upon notice. 
C.  Application and investigation fees. At the time of the initial application, the applicant shall pay the application and background investigation fees as duly set by Council resolution. An additional fee of $200.00 for each person or entity beyond five having an interest in the proposed licensed establishment shall be required. An escrow of $1,000.00 for applicants residing outside of the state shall be required to reimburse the city for out-of-pocket investigative costs and the escrow shall be released upon payment in full of actual investigation costs. 
D.  Corporate applicants and licensees. A corporate, partnership or other legal entity applicant, at the time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of all persons and entities that have an ownership interest or control in the applicant entity in excess of 5% and the extent of such interest. The list shall name all shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and state the number of shares/units held by each, either individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each licensee to notify the city clerk-treasurer in writing of any change in legal ownership or beneficial interest in such entity. Any change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the interest entitled to be voted at a meeting of the owners of the licensee, which results in the change of voting control of the entity by the persons owning the shares/units therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the license issued to the entity, and any such license shall terminate 30 days after any such change in ownership or beneficial interest unless the council has been notified of the change in writing and has approved it by appropriate action. The council or any officer of the city designated by it may at any reasonable time examine the stock/unit transfer records and minute books of any licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders/partners/members, and the council or its designated officer may examine the business records of any other licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the interest which persons other than the licensee have in the licensed business. The council may revoke any license issued upon its determination that a change of ownership in the entity licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of the licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and character of its management and its operation, but no such action shall be taken until after a hearing by the council on notice to the licensee. 
E.  Action. 
1.  Granting. Prior to consideration of any application for an initial license or renewal, the applicant shall pay the license application and investigation fees.

The completed application for the initial license shall be considered for approval by the city council. The renewal application may be considered for approval by the city clerk.

Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the premises therein described. 
F.  Transfer. No license shall be transferable between persons or entities or to a different location. Any change in individual ownership or substitution of partners is a transfer.

It is unlawful to make any transfer in violation of this subparagraph. 
Subd. 3. Resident manager or operation agent.

If such manager or agent ceases to be a resident of Minnesota or ceases to act in such capacity for the licensee without appointment of a successor, the license issued pursuant to such appointment shall be subject to revocation or suspension. A non-refundable investigation fee of $300.00 shall be paid to the city for all changes in the designated operating manager(s) at the licensed establishment.

Sec. 6.49. - Adult establishments. 
A.  Findings and purpose. Minnesota State Attorney General's Office and the Cities of St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California, have conducted studies of the impact of adult establishments on their respective communities. Based on these studies and the information received at the public hearings on this issue, the city council finds: 
1.  Residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters, bookstores and other adult establishments experience increased crime rates (sex-related crimes in particular), lowered property values, increased transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks; 
2.  Adult establishments can have an adverse impact on adjacent commercial uses; 
3.  The adverse impacts which adult establishments have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult establishments increases; 
4.  Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult establishments are located as less safe than other areas which do not have such uses; 
5.  Adult establishments can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending nearby places of worship; children attending family day care homes, group family day care homes and child care centers; students attending schools; and people using parks. 
6.  The concentration of adult establishments in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life. A cycle of decay can result from the concentration of adult establishments. The presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating which can cause other businesses and residents to move out of the vicinity. Declining real estate values, which can result from the concentration of such businesses, erode the city's tax base and contribute to a feeling that section of the city is depressed. 
7.  Adult establishments can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases. Experiences of other cities indicate that such businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also the general public. 
In order to minimize the detrimental effect adult establishments have on adjacent land uses, and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the city, the city council adopts the following licensing regulations, recognizing that it has a great interest in the present and future character of the city's residential and commercial neighborhoods. Adoption of these regulations is not intended to unreasonably restrict the opportunity of adult establishments to locate in the city. 
B.  Definitions. For purposes of this section, these terms shall be defined as follows: 
1.  Adult establishment means any adult use as defined in this section or any business engaged in any of the following activities or which utilizes any of the following business procedures or practices: 
(a)  A business that is conducted exclusively for the patronage of adults and to which minors are specifically excluded from patronage either by operation of law or by the owners of such business; or 
(b)  Any business that has a substantial or significant portion of the business or establishment that is devoted to material or persons depicting, exposing, describing, discussing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas. 
2.  Adult use means any of the activities and businesses defined below: 
(a)  Adult body painting studio means an establishment or business which provides the service of applying paint or other substance, whether transparent or non-transparent, to or on the body of a patron when such body is wholly or partially nude in terms of specified anatomical areas as defined herein. 
(b)  Adult book store means an establishment used for the barter, rental or sale of items consisting of printed matter, pictures, slides, records, audio tapes, videotapes, motion picture films, CD ROMs or any other form of media, if such business is not open to the public generally but only to one or more classes of the public, excluding any minor by reason of age, or if a substantial or significant portion of such business or establishment is devoted to material distinguished and characterized by an emphasis on the depiction or description of "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas."

Sec. 8.09. - Regulation of traffic signal preemption system. 
Subd. 1.  Purpose and scope of application. The purpose of a traffic signal preemption system ("TSPS") in the city is to afford authorized emergency vehicles the ability to perform emergency responses and services in a safer and more timely manner by temporarily controlling motorized vehicular traffic flow at signalized intersections within the city. The city council recognizes that the public has come to recognize that the operation or activation of a traffic signal preemption system at a controlled signalized intersection signals to other vehicular traffic that an emergency vehicle is approaching, entering or traveling through the intersection. The city council determines that the public safety and welfare is adversely affected and at risk when operators of vehicles, other than authorized emergency vehicles, operate, engage or activate a TSPS for purposes other than an emergency response or services. 
Subd. 2.  Definitions. 
Authorized emergency vehicle shall have the meaning as provided in Minnesota Statutes, Section 169.01. 
Traffic signal preemption system shall mean a traffic control system, sometimes referred to as "OPTI-COMM," designed for the use by authorized emergency vehicles to improve traffic movement by temporarily controlling signalized intersections. The traffic signal preemption system is comprised of four separate components; an emitter, a detector, an indicator; and a phase selector. The emitter (a high intensity light source) is attached to the authorized emergency vehicle and functions like a strobe light, pulsating at a frequency in excess of ten pulses per second and as an emergency vehicle approaches the intersection, this pulsating light is received by the detector that is located at or near the traffic signal. The detector relays the coded message to the phase selector, which is located in the traffic light control box, which then either holds the existing green light in favor of the approaching authorized emergency vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of the signal change to provide green by the time the vehicle reaches the intersection. The indicator is a light source located near the detector which is directed towards the on-coming authorized emergency vehicle to indicate to the driver to indicate whether or not the traffic signal has been pre-empted in the approaching authorized emergency vehicle's favor. 
City, county or state maintenance personnel shall mean employees, agents, or contractors of the city, Dakota County, or the State of Minnesota whose duty or responsibilities within the scope of employment or contract require testing, maintenance, repair or adjustment to the traffic signal preemption system. 
Subd. 3.  Prohibition. No person, other than an authorized emergency vehicle operator while responding to an emergency, shall operate, engage, or activate a traffic signal preemption system within the city. This subdivision shall not apply to any city, county or state maintenance personnel, who may activate the traffic signal preemption system for purposes of testing, maintaining, repairing, or adjusting the system, or to any railroad/train operator who may activate the traffic signal preemption system for purposes of traffic control at railroad crossings or nearby intersections.

The owner shall provide clear and convincing evidence that the dog's behavior has changed due to the dog's age, neutering, environment, completion of obedience training that includes modification of aggressive behavior, or other factors rendering the dog no longer dangerous. The hearing officer shall review the evidence without hearing and if the hearing officer finds sufficient evidence that the dog's behavior has changed and the dog is no longer dangerous, the hearing officer may rescind the dangerous dog designation.

The findings and conclusions shall be delivered to the dog's owner by hand delivery or registered mail as soon as practical. 
An owner's right to appeal or otherwise contest a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog declaration shall be deemed waived if the owner fails to serve a written request for appeal as required herein or fails to appear at the scheduled appeal hearing date. 
If a dangerous dog designation is upheld by the hearing officer, the dog owner shall pay the city's actual expenses of the hearing, not to exceed $1,000.00 which has been deposited by the dog owner at the time of filing request for appeal. 
D.  Compliance with dangerous dog regulations. Immediately upon receipt of the notice declaring the dog dangerous, the owner shall confine the dog in a proper enclosure and shall notify the city in writing of the dog's subsequent death or relocation.

All costs related to the purchase and implementation of the chip must be paid by the dog's owner. 
Immediately upon receipt of the notice declaring the dog potentially dangerous, the owner shall maintain the dog under physical restraint at all times including during the pendency of any appeal, and until or unless the declaration is properly rescinded by the city or a court of competent jurisdiction. An owner utilizing a buried electronic barrier/collar system to maintain a potentially dangerous dog under physical restraint, shall file with the police chief documentation verifying the purchase and installation of the system within five days of installation. 
F.  Declaration by another jurisdiction. Any dog declared potentially dangerous by any jurisdiction shall be maintained under physical restraint at all times that the dog is present within the city. The owner of any dog declared potentially dangerous by any other jurisdiction shall:

Sec. 10.20. - Shade tree disease control and prevention. 
Subd. 1.  Policy and purpose. The city has determined that the health of oak and elm trees is threatened by fatal diseases known as oak wilt and Dutch elm disease. It has also been determined that the health of many tree species may be threatened by diseases of an epidemic nature. It has further been determined that the loss of oak, elm and other trees threatened by epidemic diseases on public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of property and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is declared to be the intention of the council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases and provide for the removal of dead or diseased trees as nuisances. 
Subd. 2.  Definitions. The following terms, as used in this section, shall have the meanings stated:

The powers and duties of the forester may be assigned to other qualified persons in his absence. 
D.  Duties of city forester. It is the duty of the city forester to administer all activities of the city relating to the control and prevention of Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, and other epidemic diseases of shade trees. Each year the city forester shall recommend the details of a program for the control of said diseases and perform the duties incident to such a program. The city forester shall also act as liaison between the city and the public, keeping the public informed of new changes, modifications or developments related to city policies or tree maintenance. 
E.  Duties of tree inspectors. It is the duty of tree inspectors, under direction and control of the city forester, to know the appropriate state laws and rules relative to oak wilt, Dutch elm, and other epidemic diseases of shade trees and to know the approved control methods of these diseases. The inspectors must know the proper method of collecting samples for the purpose of diagnosing disease. The inspector, when so designated, shall assist the city forester in the planning and control of shade tree diseases. 
Subd. 3.  Scope and adoption by reference. Minn. Stat. § 18.023, is hereby adopted by reference, together with the rules and regulations of the state commissioner of agriculture relating to shade tree diseases; provided, that this section shall supersede such statutes, rules and regulations, only to the extent of inconsistencies. 
Subd. 4.  Unlawful act. It is unlawful for any person to keep, maintain or permit, upon premises owned by him or upon public property where he has the duty of tree maintenance, any nuisance as herein defined.

It is the power and duty of the city forester or tree inspector to enter upon public or private property at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting for and diagnosing and, if necessary, abating shade tree disease. In the case of suspected shade tree disease and in performance of his duties, the tree inspector or city forester may remove such specimens or samples as may be necessary or desirable for diagnosis. 
Subd. 6.  Abatement of nuisance. Abatement of a nuisance, defined herein, shall be by spraying, removing, burning, or otherwise effectively treating the infected tree or wood to prevent spread of shade tree disease. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance with current technical and expert methods and plans as may be designed by the commissioner of agriculture of the state. The city shall establish specifications for tree removal and disposal methods consistent therewith. Such standards shall be kept on file in the office of the city forester and shall be revised from time to time based on current research. 
Subd. 7.  Procedure for removal of infected trees and wood. 
A.  Whenever the city forester or tree inspector finds, with reasonable certainty, that the infection or danger of infection exists in any tree or wood on any public or private property, he shall proceed as follows: 
1.  If the tree inspector or city forester finds that the danger of infection of other trees is not imminent because of dormancy of shade tree disease, he may choose to reinspect said tree either later the same growing season or at the beginning of the following growing season. If at that time the tree has not recovered, the tree inspector or city forester shall proceed by abating the nuisance as a public improvement under Minn. Stat. ch. 429. 
2.  If the tree inspector or city forester finds that danger of infection of other trees is imminent, he shall notify the owner of the property by certified mail that the nuisance will be abated by a specific time, not more than 20 days from the date of receipt of such notice. After the expiration of the notice the tree inspector may abate the nuisance. 
3.  If the tree inspector or city forester finds with reasonable certainty that immediate action is required to prevent the spread of shade tree disease, he may proceed to abate the nuisance forthwith. When an outside contractor is hired to abate said nuisance, that contractor must meet the licensing requirements as stated in section 7.08, subdivision 1, of the City Code. The city forester shall, upon the completion of the nuisance abatement, ascertain the cost attributable to each lot. The city clerk-treasurer shall certify to the county auditor a statement of the amount of the cost incurred by the city. Such amount together with interest shall be entered as a special assessment against such lot or parcel of land and be collected in the same manner as real estate taxes. 
B.  The tree inspector shall keep a record of the costs of abatements done under this subdivision and shall report monthly to the city clerk-treasurer all work done for which assessments are to be made stating and certifying the description of the land, lots, parcels involved and the amount chargeable to each. 
C.  On or before September 1 of each year, the city clerk-treasurer shall list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable under this section. The council may then spread the charges or any portion thereof against the property involved as a special assessment under Minn. Stat. § 429.101 and other pertinent statutes for certification to the county auditor and collection the following year along with current taxes. 
D.  No damage shall be awarded the owner for destruction of any tree, wood or part thereof pursuant to this section. 
Subd. 8.  Spraying trees. 
A.  Whenever the city forester or tree inspector determines that any tree or wood is infected or threatened with infection, he may spray or treat all nearby high value trees with an effective pesticide or fungicide or both. Activities authorized by this subdivision shall be conducted in accordance with technical and expert specifications or, where appropriate, the plans of the commissioner of agriculture. 
B.  The notice and assessment provisions of subdivision 7 apply to spraying and treatment operations conducted under this subdivision. 
Subd. 9.  Transporting wood prohibited. It is a petty misdemeanor for any person to transport any elm wood into or through the city unless the same is debarked or, in the months of April, May or June, to transport any oak wood, without having obtained a permit from the tree inspector. The tree inspector shall grant such permits only when the purposes of this section will be served thereby. 
Subd. 10.  Interference prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to prevent, delay or interfere with the city forester or tree inspector while he is engaged in the performance of duties imposed by this section. 
Subd. 11.  Diseased trees in streets. The rights, duties and responsibilities of property owners set forth in this section shall be equally applicable to and binding upon abutting property owners with tree maintenance responsibilities under section 7.08 of the City Code entitled Regulation of Grass, Weeds and Trees. 
Subd. 12.  Subsidies. The duty of any property owner to bear the cost of removing or maintaining trees, whether by private contract or assessment, may be subject to a subsidy policy, if any, established by the city for the treatment or removal of trees infected with shade tree disease.

A.  Purpose and scope of application. The council may grant variances from the strict application of the provisions of the applicable Code provisions and impose conditions and safeguards in the variances so granted where practical difficulties result from carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of such Code provisions. "Practical difficulties," as used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that the applicant proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning provisions of this Code; the plight of the applicant is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the applicant; and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. 
B.  Procedures. 
1.  Request for a variance shall be filed with the city on the city's application form. The application shall include a statement of the exceptional conditions and the peculiar and practical difficulties claimed as a basis for the need for a variance and shall be accompanied by a non-refundable fee as established by council resolution. The application shall also be accompanied by sufficient copies of detailed, written and graphic materials necessary for the explanation of the request, together with a list of property owners affected or within 350 feet of the outer boundaries of the subject property. The request shall be considered as being officially submitted when all the information requirements are complied with. 
2.  The city council shall hold a public hearing to review each request for a variance and shall approve or deny the request within 60 days of the filing of a completed application, unless extended in a manner consistent with Minn. Stat. § 15.99. All owners of property located within 350 feet of the outer boundaries of the subject property shall be mailed a notice of the request for variance and the date and time of the city council's public hearing. In cases when a variance to a regulation is requested with other applications for public hearing before the advisory planning commission, the advisory planning commission shall make a recommendation to grant or deny the variance application to the city council. 
3.  The city council may approve, approve with conditions or deny a request for a variance. A variance will be denied when it is not in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the zoning provisions of this Code or when the variance is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. Any condition imposed upon the approved variance must be directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance. In considering all requests for a variance and whether the applicant established that there are practical difficulties in complying with the provision(s) of this chapter, the city council shall consider the following factors: 
a.  Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances apply to the property which do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity, and result from lot size or shape, topography, or other circumstances over which the owner of property has no control. 
b.  The literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code would deprive the applicant property use commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the provisions of this Code. 
c.  The exceptional or extraordinary circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
d.  The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to owners of other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. 
e.  The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the practical difficulties. 
f.  The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this Code, or to other properties in the same zone. 
g.  The property for which the variance is requested is otherwise in compliance with the City Code. 
C.  Lapse of variance or appeal. Whenever within one year after granting a variance or appeal the use as permitted by the variance or appeal shall not have been completed or utilized, then such variance or appeal shall become null and void unless a petition for extension of time in which to complete or to utilize the use has been granted by the council. Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the city clerk at least 30 days before the expiration of the original variance or appeal. There shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The request for extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete or utilize the use permitted in the variance or appeal. 
D.  Reapplication. No application of a property owner for a variance shall be considered within a period of one year following a denial of such request, except that a new application may be permitted if new evidence or a change of circumstances warrant it. 
Subd. 4.  Conditional use permits. 
A.  Purpose. Conditional uses include those uses which are not generally suitable within the zoning district, but which may under some circumstances be suitable. The applicant shall have the burden of proof that the use is suitable and that the standards set forth in this subdivision 4 have been met. 
B.  Application, public hearing, notice and procedure. The application, public hearing, public notice and procedure requirements for conditional use permits shall be the same as those for zoning amendments as provided herein, except that the permit shall be issued on the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire council. Although specific submissions required to complete an application for a conditional use permit may vary with the specific use and the district in which it is located, all applications for such permits shall be filed with the city on a form prescribed by the city. 
C.  Evaluation criteria. The advisory planning commission shall recommend a conditional use permit and the council shall issue such conditional use permit only if it finds that such use at the proposed location: 
1.  Will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare of the neighborhood or the city. 
2.  Will be harmonious with the general and applicable specific objectives of the comprehensive plan and Code provisions. 
3.  Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be compatible in appearance and use with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and will not change the essential character of that area, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
4.  Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, including streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer systems and schools. 
5.  Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be hazardous or detrimental to any persons, property or the general welfare because of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors. 
6.  Will have vehicular ingress and egress to the property which does not create traffic congestion or interfere with traffic on surrounding public streets. 
7.  Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic or historic feature of major importance. 
8.  Is appropriate after considering whether the property is in compliance with the City Code. 
D.  Conditions. In reviewing applications of conditional use permits, the advisory planning commission and the council may attach whatever reasonable conditions they deem necessary to mitigate anticipated adverse impacts associated with these uses, to protect the value of other property within the district, and to achieve the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. In all cases in which conditional uses are granted, the council shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with. 
E.  Denial for noncompliance. If the advisory planning commission recommends denial of a conditional use permit or the council orders such denial, it shall include in its recommendation or determination findings as to the manner in which the proposed use does not comply with the standards required by this section. 
F.  Permittee. A conditional use permit shall be issued for a particular use and not for a particular person. 
G.  Periodic review, term of permit. A periodic review of the use may be attached as a condition of approval of a conditional use permit. Unless otherwise stipulated, the term shall be the life of the use. 
H.  Revocation. Failure to comply with any condition set forth in a conditional use permit or any other violation of Code provisions shall also constitute sufficient cause for the termination of the conditional use permit by the council following a public hearing. 
I.  Expiration/extension. In any case where a conditional use has not been established within one year of the date on which the conditional use permit was granted, the permit shall be null and void or if the conditional use is discontinued for six months, the conditional use permit shall be null and void, unless a petition for extension of time in which to record the permit or to implement, effect or operate the use has been granted by the council. Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the city clerk at least 30 days before the expiration of the conditional use permit. There shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The request for extension shall state facts showing a good cause to extend the conditional use permit. No conditional use permit may be extended for more than one year from the date of expiration of the originally approved conditional use permit. If an extension is granted, the council may impose any additional conditions as allowed under this subdivision. 
J.  Reapplication. No application of a property owner for a conditional use permit shall be considered within a period of one year following a denial of such request, except that a new application may be permitted if new evidence or a change of circumstances warrant it.

A.  Provisions. The provisions of this chapter may be amended by the majority vote of the council, except that amendments changing the boundaries of any district or changing the regulations of any existing district may only be made by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all members of the council. 
B.  Initiation. Proceedings for amendment of this chapter shall be initiated by: (1) a petition proposing a text amendment; (2) a petition of the owner or owners of the property which is proposed to be rezoned; (3) a recommendation of the advisory planning commission; or (4) by action of the council. 
C.  Petitions. All petitions for amendments shall be filed with the city. If the application is initiated by the owner or owners of the property and involves the changing of zoning districts and boundary thereof, the application shall be accompanied by an abstractor's certified property certificate showing the property owners within 350 feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question. The petition shall be forwarded to the advisory planning commission by the city. 
Petitions for amendments shall fill out and submit a rezoning/text amendment application form to the city. If a rezoning of property is proposed, a scaled site plan must be attached indicating the following: 
1.  A detailed map showing the number of acres in each separate zoning district. 
2.  Any additional information that may be required under this Code. 
D.  Public hearingNotice and procedure. The advisory planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing affording the parties interested the opportunity to be heard and shall give not less than ten days' nor more than 30 days' notice of the time and place of such hearing, published in the designated legal newspaper of the city. Such notice shall also include the description of the land and the proposed changes in zoning. At least ten days before the hearing, the city shall mail an identical notice to the owners of the property and to each of the property owners within 350 feet of the outside boundaries of the land proposed to be rezoned. Failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceeding, provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this subdivision has been made. The council may waive the above mailed notice requirement in connection with a city-wide zoning or amendment to the text of this chapter, initiated by the advisory planning commission or the council. An amendment to the text of this chapter, however, shall also require a public hearing as described above. 
E.  Referral to advisory planning commission. The council shall not rezone any land or area in any zoning district or make any other proposed amendment to this chapter without first having referred it to the advisory planning commission for its consideration and recommendation. 
F.  If the advisory planning commission fails to make a report within 60 days after receipt of the application, the council may act without the recommendation. The council may table the petition for further investigation and hearing. The council may also request further information and report from the advisory planning commission. 
G.  City council action. The city council shall after receiving recommendation from the advisory planning commission and within 60 days of receipt of a completed application unless extended in a manner consistent with Minn. Stat. § 15.99, act on the application, providing appropriate findings of fact to support the action. The city council shall consider whether the property is in compliance with the City Code when rezoning is sought. 
H.  Reapplication. No application of a property owner for a zoning amendment shall be considered within a period of one year following a denial of such request, except that a new application may be permitted if new evidence or a change of circumstances warrant it. 
Subd. 6.  Interim use permits. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of an interim use permit is to allow a reasonable use of property for uses not specifically permitted in a zoning district on a temporary basis as deemed appropriate by the city council upon recommendation of the advisory planning commission and benefit the public good. 
B.  Definition. "Interim use" is a temporary use of property until a particular date, or until the occurrence of a particular event. 
C.  Evaluation criteria. The council may issue interim use permits for an interim use of property if: 
1.  The use is deemed to be temporary in light of the Comprehensive Guide Plan designation for the property site on which the use is located and the use conforms to the bulk and performance standards of the zoning regulations herein; 
2.  The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified with certainty; 
3.  Permission of the use will not impose additional costs on the public if it is necessary for the public to take the property in the future; 
4.  The user agrees to any conditions that the council deems appropriate for permission of the use; 
5.  The use meets the standards set forth in the zoning regulations herein governing conditional use permits; and 
6.  The city determines that the property is in compliance with the City Code. 
D.  [Reserved.] 
E.  Termination. Any interim use permitted hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier of a specified date, or upon the occurrence of a particular event, which is specified in the permit. 
F.  Revocation. All interim use permits shall be subject to an annual administrative review. The purpose of such review shall be to determine that the conditions of a permit issued hereunder are within compliance. Any interim use permit may be revoked for failure to comply with any condition of the permit following notice of the noncompliance and a hearing by the city council with all interested parties being given an opportunity to be heard. 
G.  Public hearings. Public hearings on the granting of interim use permits shall be held in the manner provided in Minn. Stat. § 462.357, subd. 3. 
H.  Reapplication. No application of a property owner for an interim use permit shall be considered within a period of one year following a denial of such request, except that a new application may be permitted if new evidence or a change of circumstances warrant it.

Subd. 18.  PD Planned Development District. 
A.  Intent. 
1.  Providing greater flexibility in environmental design and relaxation of strict application of the zoning ordinance in exchange for greater creativity and environmental sensitivity. 
2.  Recognizing the economic and cultural advantages that will accrue to the residents of a planned community. 
3.  Encouraging a more creative and efficient approach to the use of the land. 
4.  Encouraging the preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics, natural features, and open space. 
5.  Encouraging a development pattern that is consistent with land use density, transportation facilities and community facilities objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Standards. The provisions of this Code shall be interpreted in accordance with the following: 
1.  Rules of interpretation: 
a.  Where inconsistent therewith, the requirements set by this section shall be followed for planned developments. This section shall have no affect upon other developments or district requirements. 
b.  Planned developments may be excluded from certain requirements of the zoning code when specifically approved as a part of the planned development. Such exclusions shall only be granted for the purpose of creating better overall design and an improved living environment and not solely for the economic advantage of the developer. All provisions of the zoning codes not specifically excluded in the preliminary and/or final plan shall apply to the planned development. 
c.  Building permits shall not be issued that are not in conformity with the approved planned development. 
d.  Whenever a dispute arises concerning the interpretation and/or application of any section of this Code, the matter may be referred to the board of adjustments and appeals for hearing as governed elsewhere in this chapter. 
2.  Relation of planned development site to adjacent areas. The design of a planned development shall take into account the relationship of the site to the surrounding areas. The perimeter of the planned development shall be so designed to minimize undesirable impact of the development on adjacent properties and conversely, to minimize undesirable impact of adjacent land use and development characteristics on the planned development. 
3.  Minimum area for planned development. The minimum total area required for a planned development shall be five acres of contiguous land. Tracts of less than five acres may qualify only if the applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be waived because a planned development is in the public interest and that one or both of the following conditions exist: 
a.  Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard zoning would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community. 
b.  The property is adjacent to or across the street from property that has been developed under the provisions of this section and will contribute to the amenities of the neighborhood. 
4.  Residential unit densities. A planned development may provide for a variety of housing types in any one of the basic residential zoning districts. The total number of dwelling units allowed in a development shall be determined by either: 
a.  The density specified by the city's Comprehensive Guide Plan. A plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the site; however, the applicant has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The council, in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public facilities and services to be achieved by: 
1.  The location, amount and proposed use of common open-space, 
2.  The location, design and type of dwelling units, and 
3.  The physical characteristics of the site. 
4.  Open space. 
a[1].  A primary function of this planned development section is to encourage development which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain characteristics and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order to arrive at the maximum intensity or density allowed. In evaluating each individual proposal, the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial including but not limited to the following: 
1.  The amount and location of private common open-space area shall be consistent with the stated purpose of this section and in no case shall be less than 15 percent of the total project area. The residential portion of the project area shall further conform to the mandatory public park, playground and open space area dedication requirements of [the] Code. 
2.  All open-space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or designed functions. 
b.  Operation and maintenance of common facilities. In the event certain land areas or structures are provided within the planned development for recreational use or as service facilities, the owner of such land and buildings shall file a suitable agreement with the city that assures the continued operation and maintenance to a pre-determined reasonable standard. These common areas may be placed under the ownership of one of the following, depending which is more appropriate: 
1.  Landlord control. 
2.  Homeowner's association, provided all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The homeowner's association must be established prior to any sale. 
b.  Membership must be mandatory for each owner, and any successive buyer. 
c.  The open-space restrictions must be permanent, not for a given period of years. 
d.  The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and the maintenance of residential and other facilities. 
e.  Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the property in accordance with Minnesota Statutes. 
f.  The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs. 
5.  Permitted uses. Uses approved and permitted under a planned development shall only include permitted, conditional and accessory uses allowed in residential districts in the city and those business, industry and institutional uses specifically approved as a part of the planned development and in accordance with standards herein provided. The property to be included in the planned development shall be in single ownership or under the management or supervision of a central authority, or otherwise subject to such supervisory lease or ownership control as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Code. 
C.  Procedure. 
1.  General. Planned Developments shall be proposed and approved in accordance with this section. 
2.  Concept plan. Prior to filing a petition, any person may request a meeting with the advisory planning commission to present a concept plan to discuss the feasibility of a planned development. Such request shall be made by addressing a letter to the advisory planning commission where upon said request shall be heard at a subsequent meeting. 
3.  Petition. The petition for a planned development shall be on a form provided by the city and shall include all of the following information: 
a.  Signature(s) of owner(s) and developer(s). 
b.  All data normally required by the city for a rezoning and preliminary plat petition. 
c.  All information and plans comprising a "preliminary development plan" as defined in herein.

As a condition to approval of a preliminary development plan, the city shall require the owner and developer of a proposed planned development to execute an agreement which may include, but not be limited to, all information required in the preliminary development plan as provided herein. 
6.  Fees. The fee for a planned development shall be the same as the fee charged for a rezoning and preliminary plat when the latter is also included. 
7.  Performance bond. The owner and/or developer of a proposed planned development shall furnish a public contractor's performance bond as prescribed by Minnesota Statutes, with corporate surety in a penal sum equal to 125 percent of the city director of public works cost estimate for the required improvements to be furnished or installed by the owner and/or developer, including, but not limited to, street surfacing, curbs, gutters, sanitary sewer and water service and storm sewers. The performance bond shall be approved by the city attorney prior to its acceptance. A certified check shall be submitted by the owner and/or developer for the estimated inspection costs of the required improvements to be furnished or installed by said owner and/or developer. Said check shall be submitted at the time of the submission of the performance bond. 
8.  Variances. Variances granted as a part of a planned development shall not be subject to the zoning code. Said variances shall be permitted as a part of the overall approval of the planned development provided said variance from zoning code provisions are so stated in the planned development agreement. 
9.  Effect of approval of preliminary development plan. Upon approval of a preliminary development plan, a planned development may not be altered, revised or withdrawn without the approval of the city council. 
10.  [Public hearing.] A public hearing shall not be required provided the final development plan is in substantial conformance with the preliminary development plan. Any major change as determined by the city shall require a public hearing. 
11.  Council action. The approval of a preliminary development plan and a final development plan of a planned development shall require an affirmative vote of the majority of all members of the council except when the proposed rezoning is from an existing residential district to a planned development district with commercial or industrial uses in which case a two-thirds majority vote is required. 
12.  Preliminary development plan. The Preliminary Plan of a Planned Development shall include the following information: 
a.  All information required in the Subdivision Code for a preliminary plat. 
b.  A general development plan indicating:

The advisory planning commission, in making a recommendation, and the council, in acting upon a plan, shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The consistency of the proposed planned development with the adopted or proposed Comprehensive Guide Plan of the city. 
b.  The extent to which the proposed planned development is designed to form a desirable and unified environment within its own boundaries in terms of relationship of structures, patterns of circulation, visual character and sufficiency of drainage and utilities. 
c.  The extent to which the proposed uses will be compatible with present and planned uses in the surrounding area. 
d.  That any exceptions to the city Zoning Ordinance are justified by the design or the development. 
e.  The sufficiency of each planned development phase's size, composition, and arrangement in order that its construction and operation is feasible without dependence upon any subsequent phase.

Secs. 11.61, 11.62. - Reserved.  
Sec. 11.63. - AODAirport Overlay District. 
Subd. 1.  Purpose and intent. The airport overlay district is established to adopt by reference and implement the 2004 Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (Wold-Chamberlain Field) Zoning Ordinance, as amended April 29, 2004 ("2004 MSP Zoning Ordinance"). The 2004 MSP Zoning Ordinance creates zones and establishes boundaries that extend into the city. It is the purpose of the airport overlay district to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and ensure land use compatibility to prevent potential obstructions or hazards to air traffic in the air space above and around the city within the airport overlay district. 
Subd. 2.  Adoption. The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (Wold-Chamberlain Field) Zoning Ordinance as amended April 29, 2004 ("2004 MSP Zoning Ordinance"), together with Exhibits AF are incorporated herein by reference and are available at the city clerk's office in the Eagan Municipal Center. 
Subd. 3.  Established boundaries. The airport overlay district shall apply to all land within the city designated to be within one of the three safety zones set forth in the 2004 MSP Zoning Ordinance. 
Subd. 4.  General restrictions. No use shall be made of any land in any of the safety zones identified in the 2004 MSP Zoning Ordinance that is contrary to the provisions set forth in the 2004 MSP Zoning Ordinance. 
Subd. 5.  Designation of zoning administrator. For the purpose of administering and enforcing this section, the city's zoning administrator shall be the Eagan City Planner. 
(Ord. No. 443, 2nd series, § 1, eff. 7-21-09)  
Sec. 11.64. - ANZAircraft Noise Zone Overlay District. 
Subd. 1.  Authority and findings. 
A.  Statutory authority. This section is adopted pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 473.192. 
B.  Findings of fact. The City of Eagan finds that development and redevelopment within certain areas of the city is impacted by aircraft noise; that certain uses of land are inappropriate in areas of high aircraft noise; that some structures do not adequately attenuate aircraft noise resulting in negative impacts on the health, safety and welfare of the residents or inhabitants of the structures; that, through proper construction methods and materials, the means exist to attenuate aircraft noise to interior levels which alleviate such negative impacts; and that the requirements of this section are necessary to promote and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Eagan. 
Subd. 2.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to require that certain buildings within the city's aircraft noise zone as identified herein, be constructed with materials and in such a manner that aircraft noise is attenuated by the structure to an interior level which has no adverse impact on the health, safety and general welfare of the residents, in accordance with the Metropolitan Council's guidelines for land use compatibility with aircraft noise. These guidelines are contained in Appendix L of the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Transportation Policy Plan (TPP). 
Subd. 3.  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meanings given: 
Additions: Any extension or expansion of an existing building normally occupied by people. 
Aircraft noise zone: Any one of the four zones and buffer zone established from the MSP 2007 Noise Area and identified in the Metropolitan Council Transportation Policy Plan and shown on the official zoning map of the City of Eagan and incorporated herein by reference. 
Appurtenance: The visible, functional, or ornamental objects accessory to and part of a building not normally occupied by people including garages and accessory buildings; and other unconditioned spaces including screen porches, gazebos, decks. 
Compatible use (COMP): A use that is acoustically acceptable for both indoors and outdoors. 
Conditional use (COND): A use that is not permitted, unless it meets the structural performance standards as set forth in Table L-4, and the factors set forth in Table L-5 of the Metropolitan Council 2030 Transportation Plan, Appendix LLand Use Compatibility Guidelines for Aircraft Noise. The review of COND projects within the buffer zone shall be accomplished by the city; and the Metropolitan Council shall review COND projects located within noise zones 1 through 4. Within these zones, any land use [project] defined as COND under the compatibility guidelines and that is identified by the city as a planned development or requires a different zoning designation will be processed like a comprehensive plan amendment and reviewed under the factors described in Table L-5. 
dBA: A unit of sound pressure level weighted by use of the A metering characteristics and weighting as specified in the American National Standards Institute specification for sound level meters (ANSI S1.4-1983), which is hereby incorporated by reference. "dBA" is also referred to as an A-weighted decibel. 
Incompatible use (INCO): A use that is not permitted even if acoustical treatment was incorporated in the structure and outside uses restricted. 
Infill development: A vacant parcel or parcels of land proposed for development of uses similar to or less noise sensitive than the surrounding developed parcels. (For example, a new house on a vacant lot in a residential neighborhood, or a new industry on a vacant parcel in an established industrial area). 
DNL: The day-night average level, or the 24-hour equivalent continuous sound level (time averaged A-weighted sound level) from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of ten dBA to sound levels measured from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 
Leq: The equivalent continuous sound level which, over the period of one hour, has the same A-weighted sound energy as the time varying sound. 
Low-frequency noise: Noise with a frequency of 100 Hz or lower. 
New development: A vacant parcel or parcels of land in excess of one acre or requested to be rezoned for development. (For example, a residential subdivision, industrial park or shopping center). 
Noise reduction level: The difference between the exterior and interior sound level, expressed in dBA, during the same time period. 
Noise buffer zone: As defined by the Metropolitan Council, an area outside the aircraft noise zone, and for MSP, it is defined as a one statute-mile beyond the noise zone 4 (DNL 60-64) contour line. Generally, the noise buffer zone becomes an extension of noise zone 4. To extend noise zone 4 into the buffer zone, the acoustic gradations link needs to be maintained. Thus, for any particular land use in noise zone 4, the corresponding designation for the buffer zone would be the next lowest designation. The purpose of the buffer zone is to provide additional protection for noise sensitive uses within the context of preventive land-use measures, allow for contour expansion/contraction over time, and provide flexibility in using other tools in support of noise efforts (e.g., a TIF district), that may be partially outside the then "current" noise contours. 
Provisional use (PROV): A use that is not permitted, unless it meets certain structural performance standards to be acceptable according to MS473.192 (metropolitan area Aircraft Noise Attenuation Act). Structures built after December 1983 shall be acoustically constructed so as to achieve the interior sound levels described in the Structural Performance Standards, Table L-5 of the Metropolitan Council 2030 Transportation Plan, Appendix LLand Use Compatibility Guidelines for Aircraft Noise. 
Recognized acoustical specialist: A person qualified by education and experience to conduct sound level analysis of buildings and approved for such purpose by the city. The approved individual will have at least three years of field experience of sound control and a degree from a recognized institute of higher learning in acoustics or a closely related discipline; or demonstrated expertise in the process of sound analysis of buildings. 
Reconstruction of MAC Noise Insulation Program Homes: Replacing or repairing an existing home that received the 5dB package of airport noise home mitigation under the Metropolitan Airports Commission Home Mitigation Program when the replacement of the home is due to a purposeful teardown and total replacement of the home or when the replacement or repair of the home is due to damage to or destruction of the home by storm, fire or other peril. 
Redevelopment: A parcel of land with an existing structure or structures which are proposed to be rehabilitated or demolished for different uses. For purposes of the section, this does not apply to individual lots occupied by single-family detached homes, unless the property is subject to previous planned development or subdivision conditions or the property received the 5dB package of airport noise home mitigation under the Metropolitan Airports Commission Home Mitigation Program. 
Sound: Energy that is transmitted by pressure waves in the air or in other materials and is the objective cause of the sensation of hearing. 
Sound attenuation: The reduction in sound level which occurs between the source and receiver by means of construction methods and materials. 
Sound leak: An opening in a structure through which sound can pass. 
Sound level: The level of sound pressure measured with a sound level meter and one of its weighting (frequency) networks. When A-weighting is used, the "sound level" is expressed as dBA. 
Sound transmission class (STC): A single number rating for describing the degree of sound transmission loss specified for a wall, window, partition or other building element. The higher the STC, the more attenuation the building element will afford. (Ord. 232, 5-19-1987) 
A.  The aircraft noise zones established in this section shall overlay the zoning districts established in chapter 11 of this Code, so that any parcel of land lying in an overlay zone shall also lie on one or more of the established zoning districts. Property within a given overlay zone shall be subject to the requirements established by the other applicable regulations of this chapter and the Code. 
B.  Within each aircraft noise overlay zone, all uses shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations for the underlying zoning districts, provided, the appropriate building permit is first obtained and all requirements for conditional and provisional uses under this section are met. No use designated as incompatible (INCO) shall be permitted. 
C.  Application of provisions: This section shall apply to all new development, redevelopment, reconstruction of MAC Noise Insulation Program Homes, and construction of a building associated with a new subdivision or planned development, or amended use within an existing planned development. This section shall not apply to additions, remodeling or rehabilitation of an existing residential building, to additions or remodeling of an existing MAC Noise Insulation Program Home, to the construction of an appurtenance to an existing residential building, or to new residential structures constructed on an existing lot (as of the date of this ordinance [from which this section is derived]) where a new subdivision is not created. 
A.  Aircraft noise zones established: The following aircraft noise zones are as follows: 
Aircraft noise zone 1 	DNL 75+ 
Aircraft noise zone 2 	DNL 7470 
Aircraft noise zone 3 	DNL 6965 
Aircraft noise zone 4 	DNL 6460 
Noise buffer zone 	1-Statute mile beyond DNL 60 
noise contour 
 
B.  Boundaries: The boundaries of the aircraft noise zones are as delineated on the zoning map of the City of Eagan, on file in the office of the city clerk for public use and inspection, and incorporated herein by reference. 
A.  Noise compatibility tables are adapted from the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Transportation Policy PlanAppendix L, Land Use Compatibility Guidelines for Aircraft Noise, and as revised in the 2006 Metropolitan Council Builder's GuideMitigating Aircraft Noise. Land use compatibility shown in Table 1 hereto establish acceptable uses within each noise zone applicable to the scope of this section. 
B.  The noise reduction level requirements, as set forth in Table 2, expressed in dBA, are established for each type of land use, the amount of interior sound level reduction necessary for the use to be compatible in the applicable aircraft noise zone and to meet structural performance standards as set forth in Table L-4 of Appendix LLand Use Compatibility Guidelines for Aircraft Noise, of the 2030 Metropolitan Council's Transportation Policy Plan. 
C.  Any construction requiring a building permit on land located within an aircraft noise zone under the scope of this section shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the noise reduction requirements in this section. The necessary reduction will be achieved through the enforcement of provisions in this section and the Builder's Guide. Where a particular structure contains different land uses, the more stringent requirements of the applicable Tables shall apply, except where it is architecturally possible to achieve the appropriate noise reduction level for each different use, and the uses are acoustically separated by a wall or partition with a minimum STC of 25.

DD.  Structure means any building or appurtenance, except aerial or underground utility pipes or lines, including, but not limited to, decks, sewer, electric, telephone, telegraph, gas, towers, poles and other supporting facilities. 
EE.  Subdivision is as defined in chapter 13 of this Code. 
FF.  Surface-water-oriented commercial use means the use of land for commercial purposes, where access to and use of a surface water feature is an integral part of the normal conductance of business. Marinas, resorts, and restaurants with transient docking facilities are examples of such use. 
GG.  Toe of the bluff means the lower point of a 50 foot segment with an average slope exceeding 18 percent. 
HH.  Top of the bluff means the higher point of a 50 foot segment with an average slope exceeding 18 percent. 
II.  Undue hardship means the property in question cannot be put to reasonable use under the conditions allowed by the official controls; the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to his property, not created by the landowner; and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship if a reasonable use for the property exists under terms of the official controls. 
JJ.  Variance has the meaning given it in this chapter. 
KK.  Wetland means a surface water feature classified as a wetland in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circular No. 39 (1971). 
Subd. 6.  Administration. 
A.  Permits required. The provisions of chapter 4 of the City Code regarding the issuance of building permits shall apply to this section. 
1.  No buildings, building additions, including fences higher than six feet, decks, signs or sewage treatment systems shall be constructed, installed or altered, and no grading or filling activities not exempted by subdivision 12(I) of this section shall be permitted without first obtaining a permit from the city. Application for a permit shall be filed with the city on the form provided by the city. The application shall include the necessary information so that the city can determine the site's suitability for the intended use and that a conforming sewage treatment system will be provided should any building permits or conditional use permits be issued. 
2.  Any permit issued hereunder shall state that an identified, existing sewage treatment system, as defined by subdivision 9, shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
3.  The general provisions of this section shall be complied with before the issuance of the permit. 
B.  Zoning compliance. Zoning compliance by the city shall be required for each activity requiring a permit as specified in subparagraph A, above. This will specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this ordinance. Any use, activity, or construction not authorized by permit shall be unlawful. 
C.  Variances. 
1.  No variance may be granted except in accordance with Minn. Stat. ch. 462 and the provisions of this chapter. A variance shall not circumvent the general purposes and intent of this section. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is located. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance with this chapter, and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In considering a variance request, the city council will also consider whether the property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the property is used seasonally or year-round, whether the variance is being requested solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics of development on adjacent properties. 
2.  The city shall hear and decide requests for variances, including variances for sewage treatment systems in shoreland districts, in accordance with the zoning provisions governing variances. When a variance is approved after the department of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the approved variance required therein shall also include the summary of the public record/testimony and the findings of facts and conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance. 
3.  For existing developments, the application for variance shall clearly demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is present for the intended use of the property. All variances granted shall require reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment system. 
D.  Notifications to the department of natural resources. 
1.  Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, amendments, planned development or conditional uses under shoreland management controls shall be sent to the DNR or the DNR's designated representative and postmarked at least ten days prior to the hearing. Notices of hearings to consider proposed preliminary plats shall include copies thereof. 
2.  A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting variances, planned developments, or conditional uses under shoreland management controls must be sent to the DNR or the DNR's designated representative and postmarked within ten days of final action. 
Subd. 7.  Shoreland classification.

Subd. 9.  General provisions. 
A.  Lots for controlled accesses. Lots used for controlled accesses to public waters or as recreation areas by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions shall meet or exceed the following standards: 
1.  Lots shall meet the minimum width and area requirements for residential lots and be suitable for the intended uses; 
2.  In the event docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than six watercraft is present on a controlled access lot, the width of the lot (keeping the same lot depth) shall be increased by 25 percent in lot frontage for each watercraft beyond six; 
3.  Lots shall be jointly or commonly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot in a manner acceptable to the city and the DNR; and 
4.  Land covenants or other equally effective legal instruments shall be executed and provide the following restrictions: 
(a)  Lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They may also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment or normal property rights of adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. 
(b)  The total number of vehicles allowed to be parked on the lot. 
(c)  The total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water. 
(d)  Centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. 
(e)  All parking areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water. 
B.  Placement and design of structures. When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots of a proposed building site, structure setbacks required for a new proposed building or an addition to an existing building may be altered without a variance to conform to the average setbacks on the adjoining lots from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or bluff impact zone. 
C.  Floodplain regulations. 
1.  Structures shall be located in accordance with the floodplain regulations of the City Code. 
2.  Accessory structures, where allowed, may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined by the procedures in floodplain regulations if the structure is constructed of flood-resistant materials to the flood elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the flood elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action, wind-driven waves and debris. 
D.  Accessory structures. Accessory structures in shoreland districts shall satisfy minimum structure setbacks required in this section and comply with the following: 
1.  The accessory structure shall not exceed ten feet in height, exclusive of safety rails; 
2.  The accessory structure shall not exceed 150 square feet in area. 
3.  Detached decks shall not exceed eight feet above grade at any point; and 
4.  The accessory structure shall not be used for human habitation nor shall it contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities. 
E.  Stairways, lifts, landings and docks. Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts shall meet the following design requirements: 
1.  The stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet in width, except stairways used in public open space recreational properties and planned developments; 
2.  The stairway and lift landings on residential lots shall not exceed 32 square feet in area, except landings used in public open space recreational properties and planned developments;

I.  Shoreland alterations. To prevent soil erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat, shoreland alterations are subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Vegetation alterations. 
(a)  Any vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, roads and parking areas regulated by this section are exempt from the regulations in this provision. 
(b)  Except for agricultural and forest management uses: 
(1)  Clearcutting and intensive vegetation clearing within the shore impact zones and on steep slopes shall be prohibited. No intensive vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas shall be conducted without first obtaining a conditional use permit. No such permit shall be issued unless a land disturbance and erosion control permit and plan is approved in accordance with the provisions of chapter four of this Code and is approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is located. 
(2)  In shore impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing or cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees and shrubs may be conducted to provide a view from the principal dwelling site to the public water and to make installation or construction of stairways, lifts, picnic areas, access paths, beach and watercraft areas and water-oriented accessory structures possible, provided that: 
(aa)  The screening for structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water is not substantially reduced; 
(bb)  Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved; and 
(cc)  In the shore impact zone, live trees larger than six inches in diameter shall not be cut, except to provide for water-oriented accessory structures or to provide a water-viewing corridor not to exceed 20 percent of the shoreline width of the lot. 
(3)  The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards. 
2.  Topographic alterations/grading and filling. 
(a)  Grading, filling and excavations for the construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways under a validly issued building permit do not require the issuance of a separate grading and filling permit but shall be subject to the provisions of this subdivision. 
(b)  Public roads and parking areas are regulated by this subdivision. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any provisions in this section to the contrary, a permit shall be required for: 
(1)  The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep slopes and within shore or bluff impact zones. 
(2)  The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones. 
(d)  The following considerations and conditions shall be adhered to during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals: 
(1)  Any filling that occurs in any type 3, 4, or 5 wetland over two and one-half acres in area shall require a permit from the DNR; 
(2)  Alterations shall be conducted in a manner in order that the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible; 
(3)  Mulch or similar material shall be used for temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover shall be established as soon as weather conditions allow; 
(4)  Soil erosion control measures shall be used; 
(5)  Altered areas shall be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation Service; 
(6)  No fill or excavated material shall be placed in a manner that creates an unstable slope or finished slopes of 30 percent or greater; 
(7)  No fill or excavated material shall be placed on steep slopes without the city engineer's review for continued slope stability; 
(8)  No fill or excavated material shall be placed in bluff impact zones; 
(9)  Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters shall be in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota Water Law (Minn. Stat. Ch. 103G); 
(10)  No alterations of topography shall be allowed, except if they are an accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties; 
(11)  No natural rock riprap shall be placed, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, unless the finished slope is not greater than 3:1 (may be increased by DNR permit), the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet; and 
(12)  The provisions of City Code Chapter 4 shall apply to excavations and fills under this section. 
(e)  Connection to public waters. No excavation shall be conducted where the intended purpose is connection to public water, including boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, without first obtaining a permit from the DNR. 
J.  The wetlands protection and management regulations set forth elsewhere in this chapter shall apply and compliance therewith shall be met. 
K.  Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking area. 
1.  Public and private roads and parking areas shall be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters. Documentation shall be provided to the city that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable technical materials. 
2.  Roads, driveways and parking areas shall meet minimum required setbacks and shall not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within these areas, provided they are constructed in a manner to minimize adverse impacts as determined by the city. 
3.  Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this subparagraph are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions of this subdivision shall be met. 
L.  Stormwater management. All developments shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters. 
2.  Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities and erosion potential that will reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods must be used to retain sediment on the site. 
3.  When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities, including diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds, shall be utilized. Stormwater management measures using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration shall be used rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities when practical and reasonably possible. Settling basins to intercept and treat urban runoff shall, at a minimum, be sized to meet Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) criteria. 
4.  Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25 percent of the lot. This may be increased provided the city has approved and implemented a community-wide stormwater management plan affecting the subject site, granted a conditional use permit permitting an increase in impervious coverage, and required the necessary water quality mitigation features to meet non-degradation standards for phosphorous for the nearest downstream recreational water body identified in the Eagan Water Quality Management Plan. 
5.  When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management, a document from a duly qualified individual shall be filed with the city. The document shall state that the constructed facilities are designed and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the local soil and water conservation district. 
6.  New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before discharge. 
M.  Special provisions for public/semipublic, agricultural, forestry and extractive uses. 
1.  Any surface-water-oriented uses and public or semipublic uses when permitted by Code which have need for access to and use of public waters may be located on parcels or lots with public waters frontage. Uses with water-oriented needs located on parcels or lots with public waters frontage shall comply with the following standards: 
(a)  Topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and structures shall be constructed and maintained; 
(b)  No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs shall be placed in or upon public waters. The city may install and maintain signs conveying information or safety messages; 
(c)  No outside lighting shall be located within the shore impact zone or over public waters unless it is used primarily to illuminate potential safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of navigational lights; and 
(d)  Commercial uses such as boat rides, on-board vendors or similar uses shall be prohibited. 
(e)  Any uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons shall be centralized and constructed in a manner to avoid obstructions to navigation and the least size reasonably necessary to meet the need; except uses without water-oriented needs unless such uses are set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography. 
2.  Agriculture use standards. 
(a)  In all lake and river shoreland areas, general cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or managed under an approved conservation plan (resource management systems) consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts of the United States Soil Conservation Service (as provided by a qualified individual or agency). The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary high water level. 
(b)  Animal feedlot and grazing operations shall be prohibited. 
3.  Forest management standards. The harvesting of timber and associated reforestation shall be conducted consistent with the provisions of the Minnesota Nonpoint Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the provisions of Water Quality in Forest Management Best Management Practices in Minnesota. 
4.  Extractive use standards. 
(a)  Site development and restoration plan. No extractive uses shall be conducted without first obtaining approval by the city. An extractive use site development and restoration plan shall be approved and followed over the course of operation of the site. The plan shall address dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation, and anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations and identify actions to be taken to mitigate adverse environmental impact, and erosion, and to rehabilitate the site after extractive activities end. 
(b)  Setbacks for processing machinery. Processing machinery shall be located consistent with setback standards for structures from ordinary high water levels of public waters and from bluffs. 
5.  Mining of metallic minerals and peat standards. Mining of metallic minerals and peat may be a permitted use in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Stat. §§ 93.4493.51. 
N.  Conditional uses. The provisions of this chapter regarding conditional use permits shall apply to all conditional uses with shoreland area, in addition to the following: 
1.  Site evaluation required. Prior to the issuance of any permit hereunder, an evaluation of the water body and the topographic, vegetation, and soil conditions on the site shall be made to ensure: 
(a)  The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public waters, both during and after construction; 
(b)  The least visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from public waters; 
(c)  The site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage treatment and public utilities are utilized when available; and 
(d)  The types, uses, and number of watercraft that the project will generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to safely accommodate these watercraft. 
2.  Conditions of conditional use permits. The city council, upon consideration of the findings of the evaluation conducted pursuant to item 1, above, and the intent and purposes of this section, may issue a conditional use permit hereunder subject to, but not limited to, the following conditions:

(b)  Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement that additional vegetation be planted; and 
(c)  Special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures, sewage treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking areas, and vehicle parking areas. 
O.  Water supply and sewage treatment. 
1.  Water supply. Any public or private supply of water for residential purposes shall meet or exceed the state department of health, county and the state pollution control agency standards for water quality. 
2.  Sewage treatment. 
(a)  All private sewage treatment systems shall meet or exceed the state pollution control agency's standards for individual sewage treatment systems contained in the document titled, "Individual Sewage Treatment Systems Standards, Chapter 7080," a copy of which is hereby adopted by the city by reference and incorporated as a part of the City Code. 
(b)  All sewage shall be connected to public systems when available. 
(c)  All on-site sewage treatment systems shall comply with the setback requirements provided in subdivision 11 of this section. 
(d)  An evaluation to determine all proposed sites suitable for individual sewage treatment systems shall be made upon consideration of the following: 
(1)  Depth to the highest known or calculated ground water table or bedrock; 
(2)  Soil conditions, properties, and permeability; 
(3)  Slope; and 
(4)  The existence of lowlands, local surface depressions, and rock outcrops. 
(5)  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient information, through either public documents or field investigations, in order for the foregoing considerations to be addressed. 
(e)  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems shall be regulated and upgraded in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of this subdivision must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement on or use of the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level. 
(2)  The city will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system identified by this program within five years. Any sewer system installed according to applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under Minn. Stat. §§ 103F.201, 103F.205, 103F.211, 103F.215 and 103F.221 and amendments thereto, in effect at the time of installation, may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods or systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than required by the state pollution control agency's chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems shall be considered nonconforming. 
(f)  All on-site sewage treatment systems shall comply with regulations in the City Code. 
P.  Subdivision provisions. 
1.  Land suitability. No preliminary plat shall be approved unless each lot, created through subdivision, including planned unit developments, is suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. In determining whether a lot is suitable by the city, the city shall consider the following: 
(a)  Susceptibility to flooding; 
(b)  Existence of wetlands; 
(c)  Soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development; 
(d)  Severe erosion potential; 
(e)  Steep topography; 
(f)  Inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities;

(h)  Important fish and wildlife habitat; 
(i)  Presence of significant historic sites; and 
(j)  Any other feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, or welfare of the city. 
2.  Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions must conform to all City Code regulations. A preliminary plat shall not be approved when a later variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose, when areas are not served by publicly owned sewer and water systems, a domestic water supply is not available or a sewage treatment system consistent with City Code is not provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements, contiguous lawn area requirements that are free of limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment systems where private sewage systems are permitted. Preliminary plat lots that would require use of holding tanks shall not be approved. 
Subd. 10.  Planned development (cluster developments). 
A.  Types of planned developments permitted. No planned developments (PDs) shall be permitted, except for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built sites, or conversions of existing buildings and land in exclusively planned development and zoning districts as classified in subdivision 7 of this section and on the official zoning map of the city. 
B.  Application for planned development. 
1.  Planned development uses shall comply with the regulations applicable in the planned development zoning district as provided in this chapter. 
2.  Any application for a planned development use in a shoreland zone shall provide the following information, in addition to the information required under Minnesota Statutes and section 11.50 of this chapter: 
(a)  Surface water features; 
(b)  Existing and proposed vegetative detail; 
(c)  Deed restrictions, covenants, or owners' association bylaws; 
(d)  Details of water-oriented uses; 
(e)  Longterm plans for preservation and maintenance of open space; 
(f)  Two-foot integral contours; 
(g)  Other information deemed necessary by the city council. 
C.  Public utilities. Public utilities, including municipal sanitary sewer and water, shall be utilized for all planned development and planned development uses (PD) in the city. 
D.  Site evaluation. Prior to the issuance of any permit under this subdivision, an evaluation of the site's suitable area, density, maintenance and design, open area, erosion, stormwater management plan, facilities, centralization, design plan and conversion shall be made in accordance with the following standards and procedures: 
1.  Site suitable area. A site's suitable area shall be evaluated using the following procedures and standards: 
(a)  Shoreland tier dimensions. The project parcel shall be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward: 
Type of Lake 	Sewered 
(feet) 
General development lakes, first tier 
(riparian) 	200 
General development lakes, second and additional tiers 	200 
Recreational development lakes 	267 
Natural environment lakes 	320 
 
(b)  Suitable area calculation. The suitable area within each tier is calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites. 
E.  Residential and commercial planned development use. The procedures for determining the base density of a planned development and density increase multipliers are as follows: 
1.  Residential planned development base density evaluation. The suitable area within each tier is divided by the minimum single residential lot size standard for lakes to determine the maximum permitted density. Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for residential planned developments are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in subparagraph G, below. 
2.  Commercial planned development base density evaluation. 
(a)  Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes shall not include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space. 
(b)  Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table: 
COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT FLOOR AREA 
RATIOS PUBLIC WATERS CLASSES 
Average Unit Floor Area 
(sq. ft.) 	General 
Development 
Lakes 	Recreational

1,400 	0.142 	0.072 	0.036 
1,500 and above 	0.150 	0.075 	0.038 
 
(c)  Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites. 
(d)  Divide the total floor area by tier, computed in item 2 above, by the average inside living area size determined in item 1 above, to determine a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier. 
(e)  Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the water body, but shall not be transferred to any other tier closer. 
3.  Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned development are then compared with the tier, density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria as provided in this division. 
F.  Density increase multipliers. 
1.  Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in this section are met or exceeded and the design criteria in subparagraph G below are satisfied. The allowable density increases in item 2, below, will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are increased to at least 50 percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the water body is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the city and the setback is at least 25 percent greater than the minimum setback. 
2.  Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for residential or commercial planned unit developments: 
Density Evaluation Tiers 	Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier 
(Percent) 
First 	50 
Second 	100 
Third 	200 
Fourth 	200 
Fifth 	200 
 
G.  Maintenance and design criteria. 
1.  Before final approval of a planned development, adequate provisions shall be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of the development. 
2.  Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means shall be provided to ensure longterm preservation and maintenance of open space. The instruments shall include all of the following protection: 
(a)  Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PDs). 
(b)  Vegetation and topographic alterations shall be prohibited except by routine maintenance. 
(c)  Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles and other materials shall be prohibited. 
(d)  Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft shall be prohibited. 
3.  Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally effective alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all residential planned developments shall use an owners' association with the following features: 
(a)  Membership shall be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site purchases and any successive purchasers; 
(b)  Each member shall pay a pro rata share of the association's expenses, and unpaid assessments shall become liens on units or sites; 
(c)  Assessments shall be adjustable to accommodate changing conditions; and 
(d)  The association shall be responsible for insurance, taxes, and maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities. 
H.  Open space standards. Planned developments shall contain open space meeting all of the following standards: 
1.  At least 50 percent of the total project area shall be preserved as open space; 
2.  Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the computation of minimum open space; 
3.  Open space shall include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries; 
4.  Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling units or sites, and by the general public; 
5.  Open space shall not include commercial facilities or uses, but may contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities; 
6.  The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation, and allowable uses, shall be preserved by use of restrictive deed covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means; and 
7.  The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, shall be included as open space. For residential PDs, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone area of existing developments or at least 70 percent of the shore impact zone area of new developments shall be preserved in its natural state. For commercial planned developments, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone must be preserved in its natural state. 
I.  Erosion control and stormwater management. Erosion control and stormwater management plans shall be developed and the PD shall: 
1.  Be designed and the construction managed to minimize the likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction. This shall be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques shall be used to minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans approved by the soil and water conservation district may be required if project size and site physical characteristics warrant; and 
2.  Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within any tier shall not exceed 25 percent of the tier area, except that for commercial PDs increased impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an approved stormwater management plan and consistency with this section. 
J.  Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design of facilities and structures shall be done in accordance with the following standards: 
1.  Planned developments shall be connected to publicly owned (municipal) water supply and sewer systems if available; 
2.  Dwelling units or sites shall be clustered into one or more groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They shall be designed and located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water level, elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from the ordinary high water level shall be increased in accordance with this subparagraph for developments with density increases; 
3.  Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to swimming areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, shall be centralized and located in suitable areas. Evaluation of suitability shall include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth to groundwater and bedrock, or relevant factors. The number of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring, or docking of watercraft shall not exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier. Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other tiers; 
4.  Structures, parking areas, and other facilities shall be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the city, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening shall be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided; 
5.  Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented accessory structures, shall meet the required principal structure setback and shall be centralized; and 
6.  Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed if they meet or exceed design standards provided in this subdivision and are centralized. 
K.  Conversions. The city shall not permit existing land uses and facilities to be converted to residential planned developments. 
L.  Existing unit conditions. Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed standards in this subdivision may be allowed to continue but shall not be allowed to be increased. 
Subd. 11.  Nonconformities. Nonconformities, as of the effective date of this section, may continue, but shall be administered according to applicable state statutes and other regulations of the city for future alterations and additions, repair or replacement after damage, discontinuance of use, and intensification of use, except that the following standards shall also apply in shoreland areas: 
A.  Construction on nonconforming lots of record. 
1.  Lots of record in the office of the county recorder on the effective date of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of subdivision 8 of this section may be allowed as building sites without variances from dimensional requirements, provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became nonconforming, the lot was in compliance with official shoreland controls in effect at the time it was created, and the lot meets all sewage treatment and setback requirements of this section are met. 
2.  A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the board of adjustment shall consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided. 
3.  If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the shoreland dimensional requirements of this section, then the lot shall not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the shoreland dimensional requirements of this section as reasonably possible. 
B.  Additions/expansions to nonconforming structures. 
1.  Any additions, enlargements or expansion to the outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure shall meet the setback, height, and other dimensional requirements of this section. Any deviation from these requirements shall be authorized by a variance as provided in this section. 
2.  Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of the following requirements are met: 
(a)  The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were established; 
(b)  A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable location for a deck which would meet or exceed the existing ordinary high water level setback of the structure; 
(c)  The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive; and 
(d)  The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or screened. 
C.  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems shall conform to the sewage treatment system regulations as provided in this section. 
D.  Public utility connections. Any new commercial or residential development permitted in any shoreland district where available shall be connected to the public utilities. 
(Ord. No. 366, 2nd series, eff. 10-7-03; Ord. No. 414, 2nd series, § 3, eff. 7-28-07; Ord. No. 338, 2nd series, § 1, eff. 2-4-08; Ord. No. 452, 2nd series, § 8, eff. 2-16-10)  
Sec. 11.66. - Floodplain Overlay Districts: Floodway District (FW) and Flood Fringe District (FF). 
Subd. 1.  Finding of facts and purposes. 
A.  A portion of the lands within the regulating jurisdiction of the city is subject to recurrent flooding by overflow of rivers and other watercourses causing a hazard to life and property, disruption of commerce and governmental services and the interruption of transportation and communications, all of which are found by the council to be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare and property of residents of the city. 
B.  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing the losses described in subparagraph A above. 
C.  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minn. Stat. chs. 103F and 462, delegated the authority to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Minn. Stat. ch. 103F further provides that communities subject to recurrent flooding must participate and maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
D.  Statement of purpose. The purpose of this section is to maintain the city's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
E.  Warning of disclaimer of liability. This section does not imply that areas outside of the floodplain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding and flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decisions lawfully made thereunder. 
Subd. 2.  Definitions. The following terms, as used in this section, shall have the meanings stated: 
Accessory use or structure means a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base sub-grade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" as used in the Flood Insurance Study for Dakota County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas. 
Floodplain means the area(s) adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or may be covered by the 100-year regional flood. For purposes of land within the city, floodplain shall consist of the floodway and the flood fringe areas delineated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) panels adopted herein. 
Floodproofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
Floodway means the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining land which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor. 
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this section, the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle. 
Regulatory flood protection elevation means a point not less than one foot above the water surface profile associated with the regional flood plus any increases in the flood heights attributable to encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. It is the elevation to which uses regulated by this section are required to be elevated or floodproofed. 
Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption provisions of this section and other similar items. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(b)  Any alteration of an "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure." For the purpose of this section, "historic structure" shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1. 
Subd. 3.  General provisions. 
A.  Adoption of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. The National Flood Insurance Program regulations as codified in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 59 to 78, and any amendments thereto established and adopted hereafter from time to time, are hereby adopted by reference as though set forth verbatim herein. 
B.  Adoption of flood insurance study and flood insurance rate maps. The Flood Insurance Study for Dakota County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Dakota County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas with Panel Nos. 27037C0080E, 27037C0081E and 27037C0090E, and the Flood Insurance Rate Map Index for Dakota County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas (Map Number 27037CIND4A), with all of the aforementioned documents having an effective date of December 2, 2011, and being developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, are hereby adopted by reference as the official floodplain zoning district map and made a part of this section. The official floodplain zoning district map shall be on file in offices of the city clerk and the city planner. 
C.  Lands to which floodplain regulations apply. Regulations in this section shall apply to all lands designated on the FIRM adopted in this section as floodplain within the jurisdiction of the city. 
D.  Map interpretation. The boundaries of the floodplain district shall be determined by scaling distances on the official floodplain district map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the floodplain district, the city shall make the necessary interpretations based on the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the city initially enacted floodplain regulations in this Code or the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map that delineated or identified a floodplain on the site, whichever is earlier, and on the regional (100-year) flood profile, if available. 
E.  Relationship to other city zoning regulations. The floodplain zoning districts shall be considered an overlay zoning district to all existing land use regulations of the city. The permitted and conditional uses set forth in this section shall be permitted only if the use is a permitted or conditional use in the established, underlying zoning district as set forth elsewhere in this chapter. The requirements of this section shall apply in addition to other legally established regulations of the city and where the floodplain regulations contained in this section impose greater restrictions, the provisions of the floodplain regulation shall apply. 
F.  Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, enlarged or extended, converted, repaired, maintained, constructed or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this section. Within the floodplain, all uses not listed as a permitted use or a conditional use in this section shall be prohibited. In addition: 
1.  Modifications, repair and maintenance, additions, structural alterations or repair after substantial damage to existing legal, nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this section and specifically the nonconforming structures and uses regulations in this chapter; and 
2.  As-built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be certified by ground surveys as provided in this section. Floodproofing techniques must be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in this section. 
Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall be unlawful and constitute a violation of this chapter. Each day that a violation of this section exists constitutes and shall be deemed as a separate violation of this section and this chapter. 
G.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall apply. 
H.  Annexations. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference hereinabove may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the jurisdiction of the city at the time of adoption of this section, as amended. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of this section, as amended, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this section immediately upon the date of annexation into the city. 
I.  Permit requirements . 
1.  No person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair (including normal maintenance and repair), improve, move, remodel or rehabilitate, or demolish any building or structure without first obtaining a separate permit for each building or structure from the protective inspection department. This provision applies to any such construction upon a nonconforming structure or any structure damaged by flood, fire, tornado, winds, or any other source. 
2.  No man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system, the placement of fill, excavation of materials or the storage of materials or equipment within the floodplain shall be commenced until a permit has been obtained from the protective inspection department for each change. 
3.  No manufactured home shall be placed on improved or unimproved real estate within a floodway and no manufactured home shall be placed on improved or unimproved real estate within a flood fringe without first obtaining a permit for each manufactured home from the protective inspection department. 
4.  To obtain a permit, the applicant shall make application, pursuant to the building/construction regulations in this Code, to the protective inspection department. No construction or other activity as identified above in this paragraph may commence until after such time that the permit has been issued, subject to the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
5.  The city's chief building official is appointed as the person responsible for receiving applications and examining the plans and specifications for the proposed construction, and the city planner is appointed as the person responsible for receiving applications and examining the plans and specifications for a proposed development or subdivision to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations adopted herein. 
6.  After reviewing the application, the responsible persons may require any additional measures, which are necessary to meet the minimum requirements of this chapter. 
7.  The responsible persons shall review proposed construction, development or subdivisions to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal, state or local laws and this Code. 
8.  The city planner shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the commissioner of the department of natural resources prior to the city authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to Minn. Stat. ch. 103G, this shall suffice as adequate notice to the commissioner of natural resources. A copy of said notification shall also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
9.  As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such supporting information becomes available concerning physical changes that increase or decrease the 100-year flood elevation, the city planner shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data. 
Subd. 4.  Districts : 
A.  Floodway district. The floodway district shall include those areas designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate map as adopted herein. 
B.  Flood fringe district . The flood fringe district shall include those areas designated as floodway fringe on the flood insurance rate map as adopted herein, as being within zone AE but being located outside of the floodway. 
Subd. 5.  Floodway district (FW) and flood fringe district (FF). 
A.  Floodway district (FW) permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted uses within the floodway district (FW), provided they are not prohibited by any other Code provision and comply with the standards for floodway permitted uses set forth herein: 
1.  Agricultural uses not involving a structure, such as: general farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting. 
2.  Any use of land which does not involve a structure, an addition to the outside dimensions to an existing structure or an obstruction or alteration to flood flows such as fill, excavation, or storage of materials or equipment. 
3.  Loading areas and parking areas for industrial and commercial uses. 
4.  Private and public recreational uses not involving a structure, such as: tennis courts, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, hunting and fishing areas, and hiking and horseback riding trails. 
5.  Residential uses not involving a structure, such as: lawns, gardens, parking areas and play areas. 
6.  Outdoor storage of recreational vehicle provided it meets the exception criteria as set forth in clause J.4.(d) of this subdivision and is otherwise permitted by the underlying zoning district. 
B.  Floodway conditional uses. The following uses shall only be permitted by conditional use permit within the floodway of the floodplain district (FP), provided they are not prohibited by any other Code provisions and comply with the standards for floodway conditional uses herein: 
1.  Structures accessory to the permitted uses within the floodway and conditional uses set forth in this paragraph. 
2.  Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials. 
3.  Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures. 
4.  Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines. 
5.  Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials. 
6.  Placement of fill or construction of fences. 
7.  Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event. 
C.  Standards for floodway permitted uses: 
1.  The use shall have a low-flood damage potential. 
2.  The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment. 
D.  Standards for conditional uses: 
1.  All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. 
2.  All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards for conditional use permits set forth in this chapter. 
3.  Land excavation or disturbance. 
(a)  Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. 
(b)  Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan. 
(c)  Dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the city council has approved a plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. 
4.  Accessory structures: 
(a)  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation. 
(b)  Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to be the least obstructive to the flow of flood waters and: 
(1)  Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and 
(2)  So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
(c)  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the state building code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards: 
(1)  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; 
(2)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and 
(3)  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
5.  Storage of materials and equipment: 
(a)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(b)  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
6.  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minn. Stat. ch. 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway. 
7.  A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
E.  Floodway district prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited in the floodway district (FW): 
1.  The placement of new or used principal buildings or structures in the floodway area, including residential structures. New residential subdivisions are also prohibited. 
2.  Recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds shall not be permitted. 
3.  Manufactured homes shall not be permitted. 
F.  Flood fringe (FF) district permitted uses. Any use permitted pursuant to the underlying zoning district is a permitted use within the flood fringe portion of the floodplain district, subject to the standards for flood fringe uses set forth herein. 
G.  Standards for flood fringe district permitted uses : 
1.  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
2.  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be floodproofed in accordance with the accessory structure requirements under the standards for floodway conditional uses herein. 
3.  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
H.  Flood fringe district conditional uses. Any structure or use that does not comply with the standards for flood fringe permitted uses shall only be permitted by a conditional use permit, provided it is permitted pursuant to the underlying zoning district and comply with all standards applicable to flood fringe uses set forth herein. 
I.  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses. 
1.  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation, subject to the following requirements: 
(a)  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
(b)  Specific standards for above-grade enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must comply with the following: 
(1)  There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and 
(2)  The enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
Alternative elevation methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. 
2.  Basements shall be subject to the following: 
(a)  A residential basement is prohibited if any part of the basement is constructed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(b)  A non-residential structure of which any part thereof is constructed below the regulatory flood protection elevation is permitted, provided the structure is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance [with] the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code, making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
3.  Storage of materials and equipment: 
(a)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(b)  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body. 
J.  Standards for all flood fringe district uses . 
1.  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the variance shall be subject to a condition that specifies limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
2.  In industrial and commercial use zones, accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the property has an operational flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
3.  Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method in accordance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) criteria for specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
4.  Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles: 
(a)  Manufactured home parks shall be permitted only if permitted in the underlying zoning district and shall be subject to consideration of all the standards for flood fringe uses. 
(b)  The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in floodplain districts will be treated as a "new structure" and shall be subject to all standards applicable to permitted and conditional flood fringe standards set forth herein. If vehicular road access for pre-existing manufactured home parks is not in accordance with the provisions herein, then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan and warning system acceptable to the city. 
(c)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(d)  Recreational vehicles shall not be permitted except for purposes of storage while not in use, provided: 
(1)  It has current licenses required for highway use. 
(2)  It is highway ready which shall mean on wheels or the internal jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and has no permanent structural type additions attached to it. 
(3)  It is permitted under the underlying zoning district. 
Recreational vehicles that would be otherwise exempt from this section as listed above are not exempt when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500.00 for a structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500.00 for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/floodproofing requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in this section. There shall be no development or improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur. 
5.  Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official floodplain zoning district map. 
Subd. 6.  Floodplain evaluation procedure. 
A.  Site evaluation. Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, conditional use permit, variance, or a new development, use or subdivision approval within the floodplain district, the city shall require the applicant to furnish sufficient site development plans. Floodway and flood fringe delineations and 100-year flood elevations that are provided in the flood insurance study and flood insurance rate map panels adopted in subdivision 3.B of this section must be utilized for making floodway and flood fringe boundary and regulatory flood protection elevation determinations 
under this section. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Rules (Technical Standards and Requirements for Floodplain Evaluation and Minimum Floodplain Management Standards for Local Ordinances) shall be followed during the technical evaluation and review of the development proposal. 
B.  Notification to DNR. The city shall submit one copy of all information required by subdivision 6.A of this section to the department of natural resources' area hydrologist for review and comment at least ten days prior to the granting of a conditional use permit, variance or zoning amendment, and at least 20 days prior to the granting of a subdivision approval by the city. The city shall notify the department of natural resources' area hydrologist within ten days after a conditional use permit, variance, subdivision or manufactured park development/subdivision is approved by the city. The city shall also provide notice to the commissioner of the department of natural resources no less than ten days prior to a hearing on the application for a conditional use permit, variance, or subdivision, if a hearing is required. 
C.  Certification of lowest floor elevations. Lowest floor elevation shall not be permitted below the regulatory flood protection elevation unless the structure is floodproofed in accordance with the provisions of this section. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this section. The community development director or project planner shall maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) for all alterations or additions, to existing structures in the floodplain district. 
Subd. 7.  Special provisions for floodplain variances. 
A.  For floodplain regulation purposes, a variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control, including this section, to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in the city's zoning provisions. 
B.  The council may authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such relief or variance from the floodplain regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in the state enabling legislation for planning and zoning for Minnesota cities. In the granting of such a variance, the council shall clearly identify in writing the specific condition that exists consistent with the criteria specified in the enabling legislation which justified the granting of the variance. The variance shall otherwise be processed in accordance with the variance regulations in this chapter. No variance shall have the effect of allowing a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection for the particular area and a variance will not be granted if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. A variance will not be granted if the proposal does not provide the least restrictive relief considering the flood hazard. 
C.  Variances shall only be granted by the city upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that the failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances. 
Subd. 8.  Subdivision of land within floodplain. 
A.  Review criteria . No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be of adequate size to provide area for the building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this section and road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents. This subdivision shall apply to the development of a manufactured home park, if otherwise permitted by the underlying zoning district regulations. 
B.  Removal of special flood hazard area designation . The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
Subd. 9.  Public utilities, railroads, roads, and bridges. 
A.  Public utilities . All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain shall be floodproofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
B.  Public transportation facilities . Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the floodplain shall comply with the provisions of the section. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety. 
C.  On-site individual sewage treatment and water supply systems . Where public utilities are not provided: 1) on-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) new or replacement individual sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any individual sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the state's current statewide standards for individual sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section. 
Subd. 10.  Nonconforming uses. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this section, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this section may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
A.  Historic structures, as defined in the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, shall be subject to the provisions of [this] subdivision. 
B.  No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
C.  A structural alteration within the inside dimensions of a nonconforming use or structure is permissible provided it utilizes flood resistant materials in accordance with any of the floodproofing classifications (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4) allowable in the state building code so as not to result in increasing the flood damage potential of that use or structure and as further restricted in subdivision 10.D and subdivision 10.F of this section. A structural addition to a structure must be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation or otherwise floodproofed in accordance with this section. 
D.  The cost of all structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure, unless the conditions of this section are satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost of labor. If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then the structure must meet the standards set forth in this section for new structures. 
E.  If any nonconforming use of a structure or land or nonconforming structure is substantially damaged, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section. The chief building official may issue a permit for reconstruction if the use is located outside the floodway and, upon reconstruction, is adequately elevated on fill or otherwise floodproofed in conformity with the provisions of this section. 
F.  If a substantial improvement is made by any combination of a building addition to the outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation, reconstruction, alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure, then the addition and the existing nonconforming structure must meet the requirements of this section for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe. 
G.  In addition to the provisions herein, all nonconforming uses within floodway and flood fringe districts shall be subject to the general zoning regulations for nonconforming structures and uses set forth elsewhere in this chapter. If any provision in this section is contrary to any provision in the general zoning regulations for nonconforming structures and uses set forth elsewhere in this chapter, the provisions in this section shall apply and control, specifically noting paragraphs D and E in this subdivision. 
Subd. 11.  Amendments to floodplain regulations. The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the commissioner of natural resources if he/she determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use. 
All amendments to this section, including amendments to the official zoning map, must be first submitted to and approved by the commissioner of natural resources. Any amendment to the floodplain designation on the official zoning map must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) technical conditions and criteria and must first receive FEMA approval. The commissioner of natural resources must be given ten days' written notice of all public hearings to consider an amendment to this section and said notice shall include a draft of the amendment or technical study under consideration. 
Subd. 12.  Administration. 
A.  State and federal permits . Prior to granting a permit or processing an application for a conditional use permit or variance, the zoning administrator shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary state and federal permits. 
B.  Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered, or nonconforming use . It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, altered, or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the zoning administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this section. 
C.  Construction and use to be as provided on applications, plans, permits, variances and certificates of zoning compliance . Permits, conditional use permits, or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this section, and punishable as provided by this Code 
D.  Certification . The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this section. Floodproofing measures shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect. 
E.  Record of first floor elevation . The chief building official shall maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain. The chief building official shall also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures or alterations and additions to structures are floodproofed. 
F.  Flood insurance notice and record keeping . The chief building official or city planner shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 2) such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. The city shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.

Sec. 11.67. - Wetlands protection and management regulations. 
Subd. 1.  Council findings and intent. 
A.  The council finds that wetlands serve a variety of beneficial functions. Wetlands maintain water quality, reduce flooding and erosion, provide food and habitat for wildlife, provide open space, and are an integral part of the city's environment. Wetlands are important physical, educational, ecological, aesthetic, recreational and economic assets to the city. They are critical to the city's stormwater management and other aspects of health, safety and general welfare. Regulating wetlands and the land uses around them is therefore in the public interest. 
B.  In order to protect wetlands, the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 (hereinafter referred to as the WCA) and any future amendments thereto are adopted by reference as though set forth verbatim herein. Any activities exempted from the provisions of the WCA are also exempted from the requirements of this section, insofar as they relate to the WCA. The provisions of this section cover all wetlands, as defined herein and including those governed by the department of natural resources. 
Subd. 2.  Purposes and implementation. 
A.  Through the adoption and enforcement of this section, the city will promote the general health, safety, and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands, and requiring sound management practices and mitigation when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands. Through the implementation of this section, the city seeks to accomplish the following: 
1.  To satisfy the requirements of the WCA and, thereby, achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city. 
2.  To streamline the city administration of the WCA by providing sequencing and varied replacement requirements based on the functional values of the wetland and resulting management classifications. 
3.  To allow appropriate usage of wetlands to preserve water quality and prevent downstream flooding. 
4.  To protect and restore wetlands adjacent to contiguous open green space. 
5.  To address potential nonpoint source impacts from future development with the establishment of wetland buffer requirements to complement existing stormwater requirements. 
6.  To enhance wildlife values of wetlands. 
7.  To identify potential wetland banking areas. 
8  Manage wetlands for their sensitivity to stormwater. 
B.  To accomplish these purposes, the city will: 
1.  Utilize and continue to complete its wetland inventory and utilize related assessment information for wetlands in Eagan. 
2.  Utilize Eagan's Water Quality and Wetland Management Plan and the provisions of this section. 
3.  Establish conservation easements over wetlands and wetland buffers that are subject to this section. 
Subd. 3.  Definitions. 
Building setback: For purposes of this section, the minimum horizontal distance between the nearest point of a building or the principal structure and the edge of the wetland buffer. 
Contiguous open green space: Interconnected natural areas that can provide adjacent upland habitat and/or provide habitat connections between wetlands that were identified and mapped in a 2002 study of Eagan's land cover by the Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation District. 
Minnesota Routine Assessment Method (MNRAM): A methodology approved by Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources that assesses wetlands based on their ability to perform desired functions, such as improving water quality, reducing flow rates, and providing fish and wildlife habitat and that evaluates characteristics such as plant community diversity and structure, connectivity to other habitat types, location in the watershed, and a wide range of other factors. 
Native vegetation: Plants original to the Twin Cities area and not introduced as a result of settlement or subsequent human activity. 
No grade zone: The portion of the wetland buffer where no grading or wetland alteration activity is permitted. 
Plant community: An interacting assemblage of plant populations sharing a given habitat. 
Principal structure: A building or structure that is the primary/principally used structure on a lot. 
Redevelopment: The removal of the principal structure to the extent of more than 50 percent of its market value or size and (2) reconstruction on the same property. It is not considered redevelopment if construction is for less than 75 percent of a principal structure that was damaged by an involuntary force, such as fire, wind, or vandalism. 
Other structure: Any non-principal structure or piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner. 
Wetland: Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. Consistent with the WCA, wetlands are to be identified and delineated using the methodology set forth in the Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (Interagency Task Force on Wetland Delineation, 1987). For purposes of this definition, wetlands must have three of the following attributes: 
1.  Contain a predominance of hydric soils; 
2.  Are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; 
3.  Under normal circumstances support a prevalence of such vegetation. 
This definition does not include wetlands created from uplands either: (1) for stormwater storage and management purposes or (2) by actions not intended to create the wetland and approved, permitted, funded or overseen by a public entity. 
Wetland alteration activity: Human-induced actions that alter the existing or natural condition of a wetland or wetland buffer, including grading, filling, and dredging; dumping, cutting, pruning, topping, and clearing native vegetation; and discharging pollutants (except stormwater). Wetland alteration activities do not include walking, passive recreation, fishing, planting that enhances native vegetation, activities that improve the existing or natural condition of a wetland or wetland buffer, or other similar activities allowed under the WCA. 
Wetland buffer: An undisturbed or re-established vegetated area between the wetland boundary and a line parallel to and a horizontal distance (in feet) from the wetland boundary. 
Wetland buffer width averaging: Buffer width averaging is allowed under circumstances as defined herein. It is used when a buffer width is below the buffer width minimum in one area and above the buffer width minimum in other areas to meet the total surface area of wetland buffer as required for the wetland as classified. 
Wetland boundary: The line delineating the outer edge of a wetland that shall be established according to the 1987 Corps of Engineers (COE) Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory, 1987). 
Wetland functions: The natural processes performed by wetlands, including providing wildlife and fisheries habitat; facilitating primary production; maintaining the availability and quality of water, such as purifying water, acting as a recharge and discharge area for groundwater aquifers and moderating surface water and stormwater flows; improving stormwater quality; providing aesthetic benefits; as well as performing other functions, including but not limited to those set out in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulations 33 CFR § 320.4(b)(2). 
Wetland management classifications: 
Protect: These wetlands are valuable for protection of rare species and have high vegetation or wildlife habitat; OR they have moderate ecological quality and are important for contiguous open green space. 
Priority: These wetlands are important for contiguous open green space. 
Priority A: These wetlands have moderate ecological quality and are important for either flood storage or water quality protection. 
Manage: These wetlands are less important for flood storage, water quality protection, or contiguous open green space than the other classifications of wetlands, but have moderate ecological quality. 
Manage A: Wetlands are important for flood storage or water quality protection but have low ecological quality. 
General use: Wetlands that have been significantly altered and degraded through past disturbance. 
Wetland management plan: The chapter of the city's water quality and wetland management plan set forth in this Code. 
Subd. 4.  General provisions. 
A.  The provisions of this section shall apply to any wetland alteration activities within delineated wetlands and designated wetland buffers. In accordance with this section, wetland buffers and setbacks from wetland buffers shall be required under any of the following circumstances: 
1.  When any parcel of land with a wetland is subdivided to create a new lot or when a new principal structure is constructed on an existing vacant parcel of land; or 
2.  When redevelopment occurs on a parcel of land with a wetland; or 
3.  When any new construction or wetland alteration activity occurs on a parcel of land with a wetland. 
In determining whether any wetland alteration activities are occurring, the city will consider the following factors: 
a.  The portion of the property disturbed by the subdivision of land, the redevelopment of land, or the new construction drains to a wetland; 
b.  City land disturbance and erosion control regulations apply; or 
c.  Activity results in a net increase in impervious surfaces that drain to a wetland, or results in the relocation of impervious surfaces closer to a wetland, or results in changes to drainage patterns (slopes, meander patterns, etc.) that increase the velocity or rate of runoff to a wetland. 
B.  Any unclassified wetland shall be assigned a management classification and incorporated onto the city maps during the city's review and approval process of proposals having wetland alteration activities as provided herein. It is the responsibility of an applicant to have an existing wetland delineated by a certified wetland delineator utilizing approved methods as stated in the WCA and to assess wetland(s) utilizing the MNRAM (Version 3.0 or later version). The city shall classify wetlands delineated and assessed accordingly based on the criteria provided in the wetland management plan. 
C.  This section establishes six wetland management classifications as defined herein.

Subd. 12. \ Landscaping. 
A.  Findings, purpose and scope. 
1.  The city council finds: 
(a)  Trees produce oxygen, a necessary element for human survival; 
(b)  Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air breathed; 
(c)  Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day, thereby purifying the air; 
(d)  Trees participate in the natural process of neutralizing wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers; 
(e)  Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control; 
(f)  Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land, particularly parking areas; and 
(g)  Trees affect the desirability of land and its property values. 
2.  Purpose. Based on the foregoing findings, the council declares that it is desirable and essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the city to protect certain existing trees and plant materials, to require new and additional plant materials and trees, to prohibit the planting of certain species and to require the maintenance of plant materials and trees as set forth in this subdivision.

6.  Roof signs. No sign mounted upon a building is allowed to project above the highest outside wall or parapet wall. 
7.  Roof signs in BP and RD districts. In BP and RD districts, no roof signs shall be allowed. 
8.  Sign area. 
(a)  No signs or combination of signs mounted upon a building shall cover in excess of ten percent of the gross area of a side in the RD and BP zoning districts, and 20 percent of the gross area of a side in all other zoning districts, where business signs are allowed. 
(b)  A sign displayed on a window or within an area 18 inches from the face of the window, as measured from the interior glass to the building interior, shall not occupy more than 60 percent of the area of the windows and/or doors on the side of the building on which the window/door sign is displayed. The area of a window/door sign shall be included in the calculation of the sign area allowed for building-mounted signs provided herein and shall not exceed the applicable sign area permitted. Window/door signs shall be allowed only on the building façade that has building-mounted signage. Any sign not exceeding a two square feet area that depicts "Open/Closed" or hours of operation shall be exempt from requirements. A sign or display inside the building which is located more than 18 inches from the inside glass face of the window glass is not deemed a "window sign" for purposes of this section. 
(c)  Any property or business that exceeds the 60 percent window/door area as of the effective date of this ordinance shall be exempt from the 60 percent window/door area restriction, provided the following conditions are met: 
1.  The property owner/occupant completes and files an "exemption registration" with the city within six months of the effective date of the ordinance. If an exemption is not timely filed with the city, the 60 percent window/door sign area regulation will apply. 
2.  The property, which is exempt from the 60 percent window/door sign area regulation, is prohibited from exceeding its registered window/door sign coverage. 
3.  Any change in sign size or type rescinds/voids the exemption and the 60% window/door sign area regulation shall apply. 
4.  Any change in business located in the subject space rescinds/voids the exemption and the 60 percent window/door sign area regulation shall apply. 
5.  Any modification to the window or door size rescinds/voids the exemption and the 60 percent window/door sign area regulation shall apply.

No pylon signs shall project more than 27 feet above the lot level, roadway level, or a specified point between the two levels as determined by the council. The level used shall be based upon visibility factors from the adjacent roadway(s). The applicant shall submit diagrams, drawings, pictures and other information requested by the city prior to action by the council upon the application. No pylon sign shall exceed 125 square feet in area per side except pylon signs authorized under subparagraph C[G], below. In the RD and BP districts, no pylon signs shall be allowed. 
3.  Major complex. When an area identification is required, such as for a shopping center, major apartment complex, or major industrial building, up to one freestanding or pylon sign may be allowed for each major adjacent street. The council shall determine the maximum size after reviewing the applicable conditions including terrain, safety factors, etc. 
4.  Freeway locations. An on-premises pylon sign for identification purposes is allowed for a business sign located directly adjacent to a freeway within the city. Any business that acquires a conditional use permit to erect a pylon sign for freeway identification may be allowed an additional freestanding ground sign to be located on the side of the property opposite of the freeway. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision restricting the number of building-mounted signs permitted, a business name sign may be displayed on the elevation facing the freeway in lieu of an on-premise pylon sign permitted in this paragraph. All signs must comply in all other respects with the provisions of this section. A freeway shall be defined as a principal arterial highway as defined in the comprehensive plan. 
5.  Multi-lot developments. In multi-lot developments, the design and placement of monument and directional signs shall be coordinated through an overall signage plan.

8.  Noncommercial signs. 
9.  Temporary signs for special civic events or garage or neighborhood sales, for a period not to exceed 20 days. 
H.  Nonconforming signs. 
1.  The protective inspections department shall order the removal of any sign erected or maintained in violation of the law as it existed prior to the effective date of this section. Removal shall be in accordance with this subdivision. 
2.  Other signs existing on the effective date of this section and not conforming to its provisions, but which did conform to previous laws, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs which may be continued if properly repaired and maintained as provided in this section and if in conformance with other provisions of the City Code. If said signs are not continued with conformance of above, they shall be removed in accordance with this subdivision. 
I.  Sign permits and fees. 
1.  Sign permits. No signs, except those specified in this subdivision, above, shall be erected or maintained anywhere in the city without first obtaining a sign permit. 
2.  Application, permit and fees. A formal application together with accompanying documents prescribed by the city shall be submitted to the city to obtain a sign permit. Permit fees are as adopted by resolution of the city council and shall accompany the permit application. If any sign is placed, erected, or installed without first obtaining a sign permit, then the permit fee shall be the amount equal to two times the permit fee. 
3.  Review of applications. The community development department shall consider approval of all sign permit applications, except that applications for approval of permits for advertising signs, pylon signs and any sign requiring a variance shall be submitted to the council for final approval. Freestanding signs exceeding seven feet in height shall require a footing and foundation inspection by the protective inspections division and all building code requirements shall be met. 
4.  Return of the fees. In the event said application shall be denied, the city shall return the applicant's permit fee, less a reasonable amount determined by the council which shall be retained as an administrative cost. 
J.  Removal. All signs which have not been removed within the designated time period may after due notice be removed by the city, and any expense incurred thereof may be charged to the sign owner or assessed against the property on which they are located. 
K.  Dynamic display signs. 
1.  Findings. Studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers. Distraction can lead to traffic accidents. Drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message, but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur. Drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look. People have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end. Additionally, drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message, such as fade-ins and fade-outs. Finally, drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message. Time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short, easily absorbed, and become inaccurate without frequent changes. 
Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages. Except as prohibited by state or federal law, sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions. The restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character. 
Local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included. Without those requirements, however, there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway. If more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road, the minimum display time becomes critical. If the display time is too short, a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement. This impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs. If dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each sign's ability to change frequently, drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload. Therefore, a longer display time is appropriate. 
A constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination. Changing messages detract from this way-finding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct through last-second lane changes, stops, or turns, which could result in traffic accidents. Accordingly, dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign. 
In conclusion, the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety. 
2.  Dynamic display sign means any sign, except governmental signs, with dynamic display characteristics that appear to have movement or that appear to change, caused by any method other than physically removing and replacing the sign or its components, whether the apparent movement or change is in the display, the sign structure itself, or any other component of the sign. This includes a display that incorporates a technology or method allowing the sign surface to change the image without having to physically or mechanically replace the sign surface or its components. This also includes any rotating, revolving, moving, flashing, blinking, or animated display and any display that incorporates rotating panels, LED lights manipulated through digital input, "digital ink" or any other method or technology that allows the sign surface to present a series of images or displays. 
3.  Dynamic display signs are allowed subject to the following conditions: 
(a)  Dynamic display signs are subordinate to off-premises signs, monument and pylon signs, and business signs. Dynamic displays must not be the predominant feature of the sign surface. The remainder of the sign must not have the capability to have dynamic displays even if not used. Dynamic display signs are allowed only on monument and pylon signs for conditionally permitted uses in residential districts and for all uses in other districts, subject to the requirements of this Section 11.70. Only one, contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a sign surface; 
(b)  A dynamic display may not change or move more often than once every one minute; 
(c)  The images and messages displayed must be static, and the transition from one static display to another must be instantaneous without any special effects; 
(d)  The images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves, without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other sign; 
(e)  Every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display must be at least seven inches in height on a road with a speed limit of 25 to 34 miles per hour, nine inches on a road with a speed limit of 35 to 44 miles per hour, 12 inches on a road with a speed limit of 45 to 54 miles per hour, and 15 inches on a road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour or more. If there is insufficient room for copy and graphics of this size in the area allowed under clause (a) above, then no dynamic display is allowed; 
(f)  Dynamic display signs must be designed and equipped to freeze the device in one position if a malfunction occurs. The displays must also be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions, and the sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards of this ordinance; 
(g)  Dynamic display signs must comply with the brightness standards contained in subdivision L. below; 
(h)  Dynamic display signs existing on October 6, 2007, must comply with the operational standards listed above. An existing dynamic display that does not meet the structural requirements in clause (b) may continue as a non-conforming use subject to the regulations governing non-conforming structures and uses set forth in this chapter. An existing dynamic display that cannot meet the minimum size requirement in clause (e) must use the largest size possible for one line of copy to fit in the available space. 
(i)  Exceptions. Recognizing that some dynamic displays, such as those used in point of sale dispensers, interactive vending machines and ATMs, often need to change images more frequently than defined by this ordinance in order to perform their intended function and that such image changes can occur in a manner in which they do not create distractions for drivers, dynamic displays with a total area of less than 160 square inches at any point of sale dispenser, interactive vending machines or ATM may be fully animated, provided they do not flash or blink in a manner clearly visible from the roadway and provided they either meet or exceed the building setbacks for the zoning district in which they are located or are at least 30 feet from the public right-of-way, whichever is greater. 
4.  Incentives. Off-premises signs do not need to serve the same way-finding function as do on-premises signs; they are restricted in number by the city; and they are in themselves distracting and their removal serves public safety. This clause is intended to provide an incentive option for the voluntary and uncompensated removal of off-premises signs in certain settings. This removal results in an overall advancement of one or more of the goals set forth in this section that should more than offset any additional burden caused by the incentives. These provisions are also based on the recognition that the incentives create an opportunity to consolidate outdoor advertising services that would otherwise remain distributed throughout the community and expand the function of off-premises signs to serve a public purpose by providing community and public service messages. 
A.  Incentive Option AReduction of Sign Surfaces. 
(a)  A person may obtain a permit for an enhanced dynamic display sign on one surface of an existing off-premises sign if the following requirements are met: 
(i)  The applicant agrees in writing to reduce its off-premises sign surfaces by one by permanently removing, within 15 days after issuance of the permit, one surface of an off-premises sign in the city that is owned or leased by the applicant and is depicted in Table A (which follows this section), which sign surface must satisfy the criteria of parts (ii) and (iii) of this subsection. This removal must include the complete removal of the structure and foundation supporting each removed sign surface. The applicant must agree that the city may remove the sign surface if the applicant does not timely do so, and the application must identify the sign surface to be removed and be accompanied by a cash deposit or letter of credit acceptable to the city attorney sufficient to pay the city's costs for that removal. The applicant must also agree that it is removing the sign surface voluntarily and that it has no right to compensation for the removed sign surface under any law. Replacement of an existing sign surface of an off-premises sign with an enhanced dynamic display sign does not constitute a removal of a sign surface. 
(ii)  The city has not previously issued a dynamic display sign permit based on the removal of the particular sign surface relied upon in this permit application. 
(iii)  If the removed sign surface is one for which a state permit is required by state law, the applicant must surrendered its permit to the state upon removal of the sign surface. The sign that is the subject of the dynamic display sign permit cannot begin to operate until proof is provided to the city that the state permit has been surrendered. 
(b)  If the applicant complies with the permit requirements noted above, the city will issue an enhanced dynamic display sign permit for the designated off-premises sign. This permit will allow a dynamic display to occupy 100 percent of the potential copy and graphic area and to change no more frequently than once every eight seconds. The designated sign must meet all other requirements of this ordinance. 
B.  Incentive Option BProvision of Community and Public Service Messaging. 
(a)  A person may obtain a permit for an enhanced dynamic display sign on one surface of an existing off-premises sign if the following requirements are met: 
(i)  The enhanced dynamic display sign replaces an existing surface of an existing off-premises sign; 
(ii)  The city has not previously issued a dynamic display sign permit based on the replacement of the particular sign surface relied upon in this permit application. 
(iii)  The applicant shall enter into an agreement with the city to provide to the city no less than five hours (2,250 eight-second spots) per month per enhanced dynamic display sign in the city for community and public service messages at such times as shall be determined by the city. 
(b)  If the applicant complies with the permit requirements noted above, the city will issue an enhanced dynamic display sign permit for the designated off-premises sign. This permit will allow a dynamic display to occupy 100 percent of the potential copy and graphic area and to change no more frequently than once every eight seconds. The designated sign must meet all other requirements of this ordinance. 
L.  Brightness standards. 
1.  All signs must meet the following brightness standards: 
(a)  No sign may be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility. 
(b)  No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance as to impair the vision of a motor vehicle driver with average eyesight or to otherwise interfere with the driver's operation of a motor vehicle. 
(c)  No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device or signal. 
2.  The person owning or controlling the sign must adjust the sign to meet the brightness standards in accordance with the city's instructions. The adjustment must be made immediately upon notice of non-compliance from the city. The person owning or controlling the sign may appeal the city's determination through the following appeal procedure: 
(a)  After making the adjustment required by the city, the person owning or controlling the sign may appeal the city's determination by delivering a written appeal to the city clerk within ten days after the city's non-compliance notice. The written appeal must include the name of a person unrelated to the person and business making the appeal, who will serve on the appeal panel. 
(b)  Within five business days after receiving the appeal, the city must name a person who is not an official or employee of the city to serve on the appeal panel. Within five business days after the city names its representative, the city's representative must contact the sign owner's representative, and the two of them must appoint a third member to the panel, who has no relationship to either party. 
(c)  The appeal panel may develop its own rules of procedure, but it must hold a hearing within five business days after the third member is appointed. The city and the sign owner must be given the opportunity to present testimony, and the panel may hold the hearing, or a portion of it, at the sign location. The panel must issue its decision on what level of brightness is needed to meet the brightness standards within five business days after the hearing commences. The decision will be binding on both parties. 
3.  All signs installed after October 6, 2007, that will have illumination by a means other than natural light must be equipped with a mechanism that automatically adjusts the brightness in response to ambient conditions. These signs must also be equipped with a means to immediately turn off the display or lighting if it malfunctions, and the sign owner or operator must immediately turn off the sign or lighting when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards in this section. 
Subd. 29.  Outdoor dining areas. 
A.  Restrictions . All outdoor dining areas shall comply with this subdivision. An outdoor dining area in conjunction with a Class I or Class II restaurant is a permitted accessory use if the restaurant is a permitted use in the zoning district and a conditional use if the restaurant is a conditional use in the zoning district. Notwithstanding that an outdoor dining area may be a permitted accessory use, an outdoor dining area that does not meet the special use setback from a residential property or that provides seating for more than 24 persons shall be subject to a conditional use permit or planned development approval as applicable. 
B.  Performance standards and requirements . 
1.  No portion of the outdoor dining area shall be located or occur within any public right-of-way, including the sidewalks/trails, boulevard areas or streets. 
2.  The outdoor dining area shall meet the following setback requirements: 20 feet from a public right-of-way, five feet from side lot line, and five feet from rear lot line. 
3.  The outdoor dining area shall not interfere with any pedestrian traffic or walkways intended for the general public. A minimum four feet wide area shall remain clear for pedestrian traffic on walkways and for entry into the restaurant building and adjacent uses. An outdoor dining area shall not be permitted to be located in or occupy any parking or other areas intended for vehicular traffic. 
4.  The outdoor dining area shall be handicap accessible and not restrict accessibility in other areas inside or outside the restaurant. 
5.  The outdoor dining area shall be used subordinate to the principal restaurant building. 
6.  The outdoor dining area shall be kept in a clean and orderly manner. No food or beverages may be stored outdoors, unless a suitable means for such storage has been reviewed and approved by the city. 
7.  The hours of operation of an outdoor dining area shall be restricted to the hours of operation within the principal restaurant's interior space. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the operation of business within an outdoor dining area shall not occur between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. If an outdoor dining area is subject to a conditional use permit or a planned development approval, the city council may be more restrictive in the hours of operation based upon the proximity of the area to residential dwelling units and upon considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare of residents, businesses, and other uses near the restaurant establishment. 
8.  The use of the outdoor dining area shall comply with all noise regulations in this Code. If an outdoor dining area is subject to a conditional use permit or planned development approval, the city council may restrict days, hours, nature and volume, and other aspects of entertainment in any outdoor dining area, including a prohibition against all forms of music, radio, television, and other entertainment, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of residents, businesses and other uses near the restaurant establishment. 
9.  A fence, constructed of color and material suitable for the intended use, surrounding the outdoor dining area shall be required if the outdoor dining area provides seating for 24 or more persons or alcoholic beverages are served within the outdoor dining area. If a fence is required, a fencing plan shall be submitted with the site plan for the outdoor dining area for review and approval by the city. 
10.  If alcoholic beverages are served in the outdoor dining area, the restaurant establishment shall have an on-sale alcohol license that specifically includes and permits the sale or service of alcoholic beverages in the outdoor dining area. All regulations in chapter 5 of the Code shall apply and compliance shall be met. 
11.  The outdoor dining area must conform to all fire and building codes related to the number and types of exits that are required. 
12.  The parking regulations related to minimum required spaces for the restaurant establishment, plus one stall for every 12 seats within the outdoor dining area of more than 24 seats, as set forth in this chapter shall apply and compliance met. 
13.  All sewer availability charges imposed as a result of additional seating in the outdoor dining area shall be paid prior to the operation of any business within the outdoor dining area. 
Subd. 30.  Zoning permit. 
A.  Purpose . The purpose for a zoning permit, as provided herein, is to assist property owners who choose to make exterior improvements to their property by ensuring the improvements meet City Code requirements prior to the installation of the improvements and to protect property owners from unnecessary costs of removing or relocating improvements that are erected or installed not in compliance with City Code, as well as to protect adjacent properties that may be adversely affected by improvements not in compliance with City Code requirements. 
B.  Zoning permit required . Prior to constructing, installing or erecting any building, structure, or other fixed improvement upon any property within the city, a zoning permit from the city shall be obtained by the property owner. A zoning permit shall not be required for any building, structure or improvement for which a building, plumbing, or mechanical permit under the Minnesota State Building Code is required or which otherwise occurs within the interior of the principal building on the property. 
This subdivision shall apply to buildings, structures, or other fixed improvements, including, but not limited to, the following: sport court; patio; sidewalks; driveway replacement or expansion; play structures; piers or docks. 
C.  Zoning permit application and action . A zoning permit application on a form provided by the city shall be submitted to the Eagan Planning Division. The application shall include a site plan depicting the property's boundary lines, the proposed location of the proposed building, structure, or other improvement, accurate measurements of the proposed building, structure, or other improvement, and the accurate distance in feet from all property lines to the nearest points of the footprint of the proposed building, structure, or other improvement at its proposed location. A zoning permit application shall be denied if the proposed building, structure, or other improvement fails to meet all requirements of this chapter or other applicable provisions of the City Code. 
D.  Zoning permit inspection fee . If the zoning permit application requires a field inspection(s) by city staff to ensure compliance with the City Code, the applicant shall pay the established inspection fee prior to the city granting the zoning permit. An inspection fee shall be set by city council resolution.

Subd. 31.  Minimum maintenance roadmaximum density permitted. If sole access to a parcel is from a minimum maintenance public road duly designated by the city, then no subdivision of the parcel nor any improvement which would allow more than one dwelling unit per parcel shall be allowed on or after the effective date of this section, unless the minimum maintenance public road is reconstructed to meet the city's public street design standards as set forth in chapter 13 of this Code or access is from another public street that meets the city's public street design standards as set forth in chapter 13 of this Code. 
Subd. 32.  Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU). 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this subdivision is to permit and regulate an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) within a single-family detached dwelling in R-1 and Estate districts only as a permitted accessory use subject to the regulations set forth herein. The minimum lot size in R-1 and Estate zoning districts ensures that additional housing will have less impact on neighboring properties. Because this use will be located in established one-family residential districts (single family home neighborhoods), the installation and use of an accessory dwelling unit must be strictly controlled to avoid adverse physical, social, economic, environmental and aesthetic impacts. By allowing only those accessory dwellings unit that are in compliance with all of the performance standards of this subdivision, the character and quality of existing neighborhoods will be protected. 
B.  Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
Accessory dwelling unit (ADU) means a subordinate habitable dwelling unit, which has its own basic requirements of shelter, heating, cooking and sanitation, added to or created within a single-family dwelling (hereinafter primary residence). 
C.  Performance standards. No property within a single-family residential district shall have more than one dwelling unit, except an ADU may be permitted as accessory use to a single family dwelling when the following requirements are met: 
1.  The primary residence must be located on a lot within an Estate or R-1 zoning district. 
2.  The property owner must reside in either the primary residence or the ADU as their permanent residence. The property owner must reside in the home not less than 185 days per calendar year, and during which period the subject property continues to be the applicant's legal and principal residence. 
3.  An ADU may not be subdivided or otherwise segregated in ownership from the primary residence structure. 
4.  An ADU's total floor area shall be no more than 960 square feet or 33 percent of the primary residence's footprint (excluding any attached improvements not constituting four-season habitable rooms), whichever is less. An ADU's total floor area shall not be less than 300 square feet. 
5.  No ADU shall be permitted if the building coverage on the lot exceeds, or will exceed with the addition of the ADU, 20 percent of the lot or parcel. 
6.  An ADU shall be designed and maintained as to be consistent with the architectural design, style, appearance and character of the primary residence as a single-family residence. An ADU shall not extend beyond the height of the primary residence. 
7.  An ADU shall be located within or attached to the primary residence and shall not be permitted in structures detached from the primary residence, including, but not limited to, accessory buildings, detached garages, or workshops.

Sec. 13.20. - General provisions. 
Subd. 1.  Model homes. Model homes or dwelling units, in a number authorized by the council, may be permitted in any residential subdivision subject to the following conditions: 
A.  The model home area shall be designated on the preliminary plat, reviewed by the planning commission, and approved by the council. Said approval shall include an approved site plan detailing the area so designated and temporary improvements such as public parking areas, nonresidential structures and/or similar improvements normally associated with a model home area. 
B.  The model home area shall exist for a time period specified in the development contract or until the project is sold out or rented out, whichever shall be sooner. At the end of said time period, the subdivider shall be required to restore the area to a normal residential character, unless a time extension is granted by the council, so that the model home may serve to advertise another area. 
C.  The city may require a bond, in an amount determined by the council, to insure restoration of a model home area. 
D.  Signs in a model home area shall be regulated by City Code section 4.20 and amendments thereto.

Said "excavation permit" shall be issued under the provisions of City Code section 4.30 and amendments thereto. Issuance of said "excavation permit" does not obligate the council, in any manner, to approve a final plat. Lot grading prior to the approval of a final plat shall be done under the requirements of section 13.30, subdivision 15, subparagraph H of this chapter. 
Subd. 3.  Effective period of preliminary plat approval. The approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year or longer, as specified by the council. The council, however, may, upon adequate cause shown, grant an extension of the approval period. At the end of this time, final plat approval on the subdivision shall have been obtained from the council.

(See section 13.10, subdivision 4.) 
Subd. 4.  Zoning regulations. Every plat shall conform with existing zoning provisions of the City Code and subdivision regulations applicable at the time of proposed final approval, except that any plat which has received preliminary approval shall be exempt from any subsequent amendments to the zoning chapter rendering the plat nonconforming, provided that final approval is obtained within the one-year or longer period, as specified by the council. Said conformance shall not be interpreted as restricting the council's authority to allow flexibility in density and dimensional requirements in areas zoned planned development (PD) as provided in the zoning chapter. 
Subd. 5.  Private ownership of multiple-dwelling lots. Where the filing of a final plat on a multiple-dwelling project is to be delayed as approved by the council until after foundations, which will form lot boundaries, are constructed, said delay in filing shall be subject to the following conditions: 
A.  All final plat procedures shall be followed and completed prior to issuance of building permits except for the preparation of final plat map, signing of the final plat, unless signature is not required by state law, and dedication of public lands shown on the plat. In place of the final plat map, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary copy of the final plat map which the council shall use in granting its approval and the city shall use in issuing building permits. 
B.  The final plat map shall be submitted, signed by the city, unless signature is not required by state law, and recorded with the county, and final plat requirements shall be met in all other respects prior to the occupancy for residential use of any dwelling unit included in the area of the final plat. 
Subd. 6.  Findings related to preliminary and final plats. In the case of all platting, the planning commission and the council shall be guided by criteria, including the following, in approving, denying or establishing conditions related thereto:

G.  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will not conflict with easements of record or with easements established by judgment of court. 
H.  That completion of the proposed development of the subdivision can be completed in a timely manner so as not to cause an economic burden upon the city for maintenance, repayment of bonds or similar burden. 
I.  That the subdivision has been properly planned for possible solar energy system use within the subdivision or as it relates to adjacent property. (Refer to city handbook on solar access.) 
J.  That the design of public improvements for the subdivision is compatible and consistent with the platting or approved preliminary plat on adjacent lands. 
K.  That the subdivision is in compliance with those standards set forth in the city's water quality and wetland management plan which is properly approved and filed in the office of the city clerk and in effect as of the date the subdivision application was received by the city, hereinafter referred to as the "water quality management plan." Said document and all of the notations, references and other information contained therein shall have the same force and effect as if fully set down herein and is hereby made a part of this chapter by reference and incorporated herein as fully as if set forth herein at length.

Subd. 8.  Public uses. 
A.  Parks, trail, recreational areas, ponding areas and other public uses. 
1.  Designation on preliminary plat. Where a proposed park, recreational facility as defined in Minn. Stat. § 471.191, playground, wetland, trail, ponding or open space area, shown on the city's comprehensive guide plan, park development guide, official map, or suitable alternate approved by the council, is located in the whole or in part in a subdivision, such area or areas shall be shown on the preliminary plat or otherwise designated to the city. The city must first reasonably determine, however, that such area or areas will need to be acquired for the purposes stated above in this subsection. The city, whether acquiring land or a cash contribution in lieu thereof, shall give due consideration to the open space, recreation or common areas and facilities open to the public that the applicant proposes to reserve for this subdivision in making such determination. Such area or areas shall also be dedicated to the city by the subdivider if the council requests such dedication under the remaining provisions of this subdivision. 
2.  Parkland dedication or cash contribution. Said dedicated land, which shall be buildable land, shall be in an amount determined to be reasonable by the council as established by resolution. The cash contribution amount shall be established pursuant to section 13.20, subd. 10 of this ordinance. The cash contribution amount shall be based on the fair market value of the land no later than at the time of final approval. 
In lieu of the conveyance of dedicated land as provided above, the owner or subdivider may, at the option of the city, pay to the city, for use in acquisition and development of parks, a cash payment. The cash payment shall be placed in a special fund to be used only for the purposes for which the payments were obtained. Cash payments received must be used only for the acquisition and development or improvement of parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space based on the approved park system's plan. Cash payments must not be used for the ongoing operation or maintenance of parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands or open space. 
Previously subdivided property, from which a park dedication has been received, that is being resubdivided with the same number of lots, is exempt from additional park dedication requirements. As a result of resubdividing the property, if the number of lots is increased, then new park dedication or per lot cash contribution shall apply to the net increase of lots. 
3.  Dedication credits for construction. Dedication credit shall not be granted for the construction of recreational facilities unless a specific agreement granting credit is approved by the council. 
4.  Dedication of wetlands and ponding areas. 
(a)  Wetlands and ponding areas, needed as a part of the overall city storm drainage plan, shall be dedicated in fee or easement at the option of the city and in a form acceptable to the city. However, no credit shall be given for park dedication unless said area meets the criteria for public parks as stated in the city's comprehensive plan and the city's park dedication resolution and is approved as such by the council. Said dedication of land or easement shall be in a form approved by the council. 
(b)  As a prerequisite to plat approval and/or a waiver of plat approval, the applicant shall dedicate wetlands and ponding areas required under the city water quality management plan and/or shall make a cash contribution to the city's water quality management fund at the city's option. Wetland and ponding area dedication shall be in an amount as determined by the council as reasonably necessary to comply with the city's water quality management plan. The cash contribution amount shall be as established pursuant to section 13.20, subd. 10 of this ordinance. 
5.  Land in excess of dedication requirements. Where land proposed for public use exceeds the amount legally and reasonably required by the city and the subdivider will not dedicate the additional amount, the council shall have a maximum of four months from the date of preliminary plat approval by the council to proceed with an option or purchase of said additional amount. Where a purchase is not initiated, the plat shall be revised to permit another use and the processing of the plat shall continue. 
6.  Timing of dedication. If a new subdivision is designed to be platted into more than one addition, all park or other public use lands contemplated under this section for each phase of the subdivision, except streets, alleys or easements other than those leading directly to such sites, shall be dedicated by the time of approval of the final plat for that phase. 
7.  Condition of areas to be dedicated. Areas to be dedicated for public use, trail, wetland or ponding shall be brought to a suitable condition by the subdivider prior to acceptance by the city. All dead and diseased trees, trash, junk, unwanted structures or similar undesirable elements shall be removed by the owner at his expense. Said condition shall also be in accordance with the city handbook on environmental protection. 
8.  As a prerequisite to plat approval and/or a waiver of plat approval, the applicant shall dedicate land required to complete the city's trail plan and/or shall make a cash contribution to the city's park trail fund, at the city's option. Land dedication shall be in an amount as determined by the council as reasonably necessary to comply with the city's trail plan in accordance with the city's trail dedication policy. The cash contribution shall be as established pursuant to section 13.20, subd. 10 of this ordinance. For residential property, the cash contribution shall be made at the time of approval of the final plat or approval of the waiver of plat in the amount as determined by the rate schedule in effect at the time of the approval. With respect to commercial, industrial, or public facility property, the cash contribution shall be made at the time of the issuance by the city of a building permit in the amount as determined by the rate schedule in effect at the time of the issuance of the permit. 
B.  Title and survey requirements. Lands so dedicated shall be accompanied by a certificate of survey or shall be designated as a lot or outlot on the plat as determined by the city. Further, such lands shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances including special assessments as evidenced by an up-to-date abstract of title or registered property abstract to be submitted at developer's cost to the city for its examination. Such dedication shall be in the form and manner as prescribed by the city attorney. 
Subd. 9.  Landlocked parcels. As a general rule, the city shall not permit landlocked parcels or parcels that are only served by private easements. However, the city may permit the following: 
A.  Landlocked parcels in a multiple-dwelling or commercial complexes provided said parcel(s) have access to a public street by an easement over another parcel within the same multiple-dwelling or commercial complex. Said landlocked parcel is permitted in this instance only for the purpose of establishing separate taxable parcels within a complex. 
B.  Landlocked parcels which are unbuildable (outlots or parcels) reserved as permanent public open spaces such as ponding areas may be permitted. 
Subd. 10.  Fees. Where fees are not specifically stated in this chapter, said fees shall be established by resolution of the council, which may revise the fee schedule from time to time. A schedule of all fees established by this chapter shall be published and available at the city hall. 
Subd. 11.  Council vote. All actions related to this chapter, including amendments, variances, waivers and plat approvals, shall require a majority vote of the members of the council present at a duly constituted council meeting. 
Subd. 12.  Planned developments. In platting areas zoned planned development (PD) districts as described in the zoning chapter, the following shall be required: 
A.  A valid "planned development agreement" shall be entered into at or prior to final plat approval by the city or said approval shall be null and void. 
B.  As a part of the approval of a plat, the council may grant any dimensional deviations from the strict dimensional requirements for each base zoning district as deemed necessary to accomplish an overall plan under the provisions of a planned development district. 
C.  Said deviation as described in the above subparagraph shall not be interpreted to automatically increase densities above those permitted in the planned development agreement. Said deviations shall relate only to dimensions. 
D.  Said dimensional deviations approved as a part of a plat in a planned development district shall not require individual variances. 
E.  Said dimensional deviations as referenced in this subdivision of this chapter shall relate to lot area, lot width, lot depth, frontage on a public street, street width, setbacks for any yard, height, setback from adjacent zoning district or use, length of culs-de-sac, length of block and radius of culs-de-sac. 
F.  Said dimensional deviations shall be clearly stated and documented at the time of approval by the council before they shall have full form and effect. 
Subd. 13.  Plat approved without variances. Where a plat has been approved by the city and recorded with the county which contains a lot or lots which do not meet the minimum required dimensions as stated in this chapter or in the zoning chapter, said lots shall have the following status: 
A.  Said lot(s) shall be considered conforming lots and be entitled to all rights normally expected with a conforming lot under the circumstances of subparagraphs B and C below. 
B.  Said lot(s) shall not be entitled to any special consideration for other variances and no other dimensional variances other than those existing on the plat shall be automatically accrued. 
C.  Deviations from the zoning chapter are noted in subdivision 12 of this section. 
Subd. 14.  Building permits prior to public and private services. 
A.  No permits until contract awarded. In plats that are to be served by municipal water and sanitary sewer, the city shall not issue building permits until a contract has been awarded for the installation of said water and sewer by the city or by the developer and as approved by the city.

Failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceeding, provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this subdivision has been made. 
Subd. 5.  Fees. The required fees to be paid for each petition required under this chapter shall be established by separate resolution of the council, and the fee schedule may be revised from time to time. Where said fees do not cover costs incurred by the city in the processing of the petition, the petitioner shall be required to pay additional fees upon receipt of an itemized invoice from the city. 
Subd. 6.  Amendments.
