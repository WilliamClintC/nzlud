(c) 	
Certification for collection with taxes. 

(1) 	
Unpaid charges on water, sewer, and other utility services shall not be certified to the county auditor until notice for a hearing has been provided to the owner of the premises involved. The notice shall be sent by first class mail and shall state that if payment is not made by September 25, the entire amount unpaid plus a penalty of ten percent will be certified to the county auditor for collection as other taxes are collected. The notice shall also state that the occupant may, before such certification date, attend or schedule a hearing on the matter to object to certification of unpaid utility charges. 

(2) 	
The owner of the property shall have the option of paying the balance due on the account by September 25. After this date, the certified roll will be finalized. After the date the certified roll is finalized, payments will still be accepted but will include the ten percent penalty. 

(3) 	
A hearing shall be heard on the matter by the city council.   Property owners with unpaid utility charges shall have the opportunity to object to the certification of unpaid charges to be collected as taxes are collected. If, after the hearing, the city council finds that the amounts claimed as delinquent are actually due and unpaid and that there is no legal reason why the unpaid charges should not be certified for collection with taxes in accordance with this section, the city may certify the unpaid charges to the county auditor for collection as other taxes are collected. 

(4) 	
For each certification sustained, the property owner shall have the following options after the hearing:

Subd. 4. Maintenance, Repair and Replacement. The city shall maintain and repair at its expense any meter that has become unserviceable through ordinary wear and tear and shall replace it if necessary. Where, however, any replacement or repair or adjustment of any meter is necessary because of damage from hot water backup, damage from freezing water, or damage from any act, carelessness or negligence of the owner or occupants of any premises, any expense incurred by the city to repair the damage will be added to the water consumer’s bill for water service. Delinquencies in paying such expenses will be handled in the manner provided by the Loretto city code for handling delinquent water accounts.  (Added, 5/16/89)

If the test shows the meter over reads the amount of water consumed by five percent or more, the deposit shall be refunded, an accurate meter shall be installed, and the bill shall be adjusted accordingly. Such adjustment shall not extend back more than one service period from the date of the written request.  The minimum charge shall not be affected. If the test shows an accurate measurement of water, the amount deposited shall be retained by the city to cover the expenses of making the test. If the test shows that the meter under reads the amount of water consumed, the amount deposited shall be retained by the city to cover the costs of making the test and an accurate meter shall be installed.

If an owner or occupant fails to complete and return a meter reading card by the due date, the water usage for the premises will be estimated by the city clerk.  If an owner or occupant fails to timely complete and return the meter reading card for two or more consecutive months, the city clerk may direct an authorized meter reader to read the meter on the premises, and the owner or occupant will be billed for a meter reading charge in an amount as established from time to time by resolution of the city council.  (Added, 5/16/89; Amended, 5/24/89) 
Subd. 8. Unauthorized Tampering with Meter. No person not authorized by the city shall connect, disconnect, take apart, or in any manner change or interfere with any such meter or its use.

Discharges in Violation of Industrial or Construction Activity NPDES Storm Water Discharge Permit. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the public works administrator prior to or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, or development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause.  
(h) 	Suspension of MS4 Access. Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States.  If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. (Added, Ord. 2005-12) 
Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. 
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city. 
(i) 	
Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges.  Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Added, Ord. 2005-12)

The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm water system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.  Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Added, Ord. 2005-12) 

(l) 	
Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 


(Added, Ord. 2005-12) 
(m) 	Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm water system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.  In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

Section 413. FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT. (Added, Ord. No. 2016-03, Deleted Ord. No. 2004-05) 
Section 413:00. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE. 
Subdivision. 1. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Loretto, Minnesota, does ordain as follows. 
Subd. 2. Purpose. 
(a) 	
This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the city of Loretto.  These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. 

(b) 	
National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 

(c) 	
This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 


Section 413:05. GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
Subdivision 1.  How to Use This Ordinance: This ordinance adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the city of Loretto and includes three floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain. 
(a) 	
Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in Sections 413:15 or 413:20 will apply, depending on the location of a property. 

(b) 	
Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within the General Floodplain district, the Floodway District standards in Section 413:15 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in Section 413:25. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District standards in Section 413:20 may apply outside the floodway. 


Subd. 2. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies.  This ordinance applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of Loretto shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain Districts. 
(a) 	The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this ordinance. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply. 
Subd. 3.  Incorporation of Maps by Reference: The following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the Official Zoning Map and this ordinance. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016 and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016, all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the City Clerk’s office.   
Effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panels: 27053C0142F. 
Subd. 4. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
Subd. 5. Interpretation:  The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.   
(a) 	
Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The City Engineer must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data. 

(b) 	
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council and to submit technical evidence. 


Subd. 6. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
Subd. 7. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of the city of Loretto or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
Subd. 8. Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.

(s) 	
Obstruction – any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 

(t) 	
One Hundred Year Floodplain – lands inundated by the “Regional Flood” (see definition). 

(u) 	
Principal Use or Structure – all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 

(v) 	
Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 

(w) 	
Recreational Vehicle – a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this ordinance, the term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.” 

(x) 	
Regional Flood – a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1% chance or 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. 

(y) 	
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) - an elevation not less than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 

(z)

(aa) 	Special Flood Hazard Area – a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with “One Hundred Year Floodplain.” 
(bb) 	Start of Construction – includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit’s expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(cc) 	Structure -anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in Section 413:40, Subd. 2(b) and other similar items. 
(dd) 	Substantial Damage -means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(ee) 	Substantial Improvement -within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes 
structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1) 	
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 

(2) 	
Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.” For the purpose of this ordinance, “historic structure” is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.

(a) 	
Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Floodplain District, the City Engineer must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source. 

(b) 	
If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in Section 413:25, Subd. 2(c) below. 

(c) 	
The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following components, as applicable:  

(1) 	
Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood. 

(2) 	
Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 

(3) 	
Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 



(d) 	
The City Engineer will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The City Engineer may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the City Engineer may recommend approval or denial of the application by the City Council. 

(e) 	
Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been determined, the City Clerk must process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Sections 413:15 and 413:20 of this ordinance.

(c) 	
Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied: 

(1) 	
Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 

(2) 	
Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 

(3) 	
Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 



(d) 	
Flood Insurance Notice. The City Clerk must notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and 2) Such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 

(e) 	
General Considerations. The community may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains: 

(1) 	
The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments; 

(2) 	
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others; 

(3) 	
The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions; 

(4) 	
The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 

(5) 	
The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the community; 

(6) 	
The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location; 

(7) 	
The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding; 

(8) 	
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;  

(9) 	
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and flood plain management program for the area;  

(10) 	
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 

(11) 	
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 



(f) 	
Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  The City Clerk must submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’ notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 

(g) 	
Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 

(h) 	
Record-Keeping.  The City Clerk must maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

flexibility in land development and redevelopment in order to utilize new techniques of building design, construction and land development; 

(b) 	
compliance with the city’s affordable housing goals; 

(c) 	
energy conservation through the use of more efficient building designs and sitings and the clustering of structures and land uses; 

(d) 	
preservation of desirable site characteristics and open space and protection of sensitive environmental features; 

(e) 	
efficient and effective use of land, open space and public facilities through mixing of land uses and assembly and development of land in larger parcels; 

(f) 	
use of design standards of high quality and compatible with surrounding land uses; and 

(g) 	
development which is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 


(Added, Ord. 98-10) 
Subd. 2.  Allowed Uses. Within the PUD district all permitted uses and accessory uses allowed within any zoning district are permitted. Within the PUD district all uses allowed by conditional use permit within any district are allowed by conditional use permit. Uses allowed by conditional use permit must be reviewed for compliance with the conditional use permit standards specified in this code.  
Subd. 3. Development Standards. Within the PUD district all development must be in compliance with the following: 
(a) 	
Each PUD must contain a minimum area of two acres; 

(b) 	
The use or uses allowed in a PUD must be consistent with the comprehensive plan designation for the area included within the PUD; 

(c) 	
A residential PUD or the residential portion of a mixed use PUD may have a unit density of to ten percent greater than the density which would be permitted if the area were developed without a PUD; 

(d) 	
Within a PUD the building setbacks from the outside boundaries of the PUD shall not be less than 30 feet. Building setbacks from internal streets shall not be less than 20 feet. All other setbacks shall be a specified in the development plan; 

(e) 	
More than one building may be placed on a platted or recorded lot in a PUD; 

(f)

Property to be included within a PUD must be under unified ownership or control or subject to such legal restrictions or covenants as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the approved development plan and final site and building plan; 

(h) 	
Signs are restricted to those permitted in the development plan; 

(i) 	
A PUD which involves a single land use type or housing type may be permitted provided that it is otherwise consistent with the objectives of this chapter and the comprehensive plan; 

(j) 	
The uniqueness of each PUD requires that specifications and standards for streets, utilities, public facilities and subdivisions may be subject to modification from the applicable ordinances ordinarily governing them.  The city council may approve streets, utilities, public facilities and land subdivisions which are not in compliance with usual specifications or ordinance requirements if it finds that strict adherence to such standards or requirements is not required to meet the intent of this chapter or to protect the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the PUD, the surrounding area or the city as a whole; and 

(k) 	
No building or other permits shall be issued for any work on property included within a proposed or approved PUD nor may any work occur therein unless such work is in compliance with the proposed or approved development plan.

After the expiration of such period or periods, approval of the development plan shall be void. 

(b) 	
If application has not been made for a final site and building plan approval pursuant to the approved development plan prior to the time approval of the development plan becomes void, the city council may rezone the property to the original zoning classification at the time of the PUD application or to a zoning classification consistent with the comprehensive plan. 

(c) 	
If construction on the property included within an approved development plan has not commenced within one year following the date on which the final site and building plan is approved, the city council may rezone the property to the original zoning classification at the time of the PUD application or to a zoning classification consistent with the comprehensive plan.

If the public works administrator finds that a sidewalk is in need of repairs or reconstruction, written notice will be given to the record owner of the abutting property specifying the type of repair or reconstruction necessary and the estimated costs for the work to be completed. Such notice shall order completion of the work within 30 days after receipt of the notice and state that if the owner fails to do so, the public works administrator will cause the work to be done on behalf of the city, that 50% of the expense must be paid by the owner, and that if unpaid, it will be made a special assessment against the property affected. Where in the opinion of the public works administrator, an emergency exists, such notice may require completion of the work within a lesser period of time that is reasonable under the circumstances. 
Subd. 2. Repair by Owner. If the owner undertakes to do the sidewalk repair or reconstruction, all work must be done in strict compliance with the specifications of the public works administrator and only after the owner has obtained all necessary permits.

The city clerk shall, prior to October 1 of each year, certify the list of unpaid costs to the county auditor for collection along with current taxes in the following year, in a single installment.

Section 520.  TREE DISEASES. 
Section 520:00. DECLARATION OF POLICY. The city council determines that the health of the elm and oak trees within the municipal limits is threatened by fatal diseases known as Dutch elm and oak wilt diseases, and other trees may be threatened by other epidemic diseases of shade trees. It further determines that the loss of elm, oak and other trees growing upon public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of property within the city and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public.  It is declared to be the intention of the council to control and prevent the spread of those diseases and this chapter is enacted for that purpose. 
Section 520:05. FORESTER. The city council may assign a forester to administer tree disease enforcement activities. It is the duty of the forester to coordinate, under the direction and control of the council, all activities of the municipality relating to the control and prevention of Dutch elm disease and oak wilt disease and other epidemic diseases of shade trees. Forester shall recommend to the council the details of a program for the control of such disease; and perform the duties incident to such a program adopted by the council. 
Section 520:10. EPIDEMIC DISEASE PROGRAM. It is the intention of the council to conduct a program of plant pest control pursuant to all the powers of this city including the authority granted by Minnesota Statutes, section 18.022. This program is concentrated on, but not limited to, the control and elimination of Dutch elm disease fungus, elm bark beetles and the oak wilt fungus and is undertaken at the recommendation of the commissioner of agriculture. The forester shall act as coordinator between the commissioner of agriculture and the council in the conduct of this program.

Section 830. ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS. 
(Added, Ord. 2003-02) 
Section 830:00. Purpose and Intent. 
Subdivision 1. Purpose and Intent. Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American Planning Association and cities such as St. Paul; Indianapolis; Alexandria, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; Seattle, Washington; have studied the impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These studies have concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods. Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. The city council of the city of Loretto makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate adult establishments. The findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located, as studied by the city council and city staff. Based on these studies and findings, the city council concludes: 
(a) 	
Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above. 

(b) 	
The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments are governed by locational requirements, licensing requirements and health requirements. 

(c) 	
It is not the intent of the city council to prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city. 

(d) 	
Minnesota Statutes, section 462.357, allows the city to adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. 

(e) 	
The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments. 

(f) 	
Adult establishments can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in which such businesses are located, taxing city crime-prevention 


programs and law enforcement services. 

Loretto City Code 830:00, Subd. 2 (Rev. 2003) 
(g) 	
Adult establishments can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity. The experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses can, however, minimize this risk, provided the owners and operators of such facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures. 

(h) 	
Adult establishments can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases including but not limited to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for which currently there is no cure.  Experiences of other cities indicate that such businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also the general public. 

(i) 	
Adult establishments can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on the same premises. 

(j) 	
The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can be minimized through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein. 


Subd. 2. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate adult establishments to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to: 
(a) 	
Prevent additional criminal activity within the city,  

(b) 	
Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood; 

(c) 	
To locate adult establishments away from residential areas, schools, churches, libraries, parks, and playgrounds; 

(d) 	
Prevent concentration of adult establishments within certain areas of the city. 


Subd. 3. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to adult oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended market.

The abatement order will be enforced by mandatory or prohibitory injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
Section 830:75. Severability.
