Appendix A
Dog Tethering Recommendations
In recognition of the danger of unregulated, prolonged tethering, the City of Easthampton (“City”) finds importance in enacting legislation (see City Ordinances, Chapter 11, Sec.11-18) that will enhance public safety and animal welfare. Several authorities have acknowledged the cruelty involved with prolonged tethering, as well as the negative effect it has on a dog, making it three-times more likely to bite. Dogs are social, pack animals by nature, requiring closeness and interaction to be content; thus, prolonged tethering or confinement deprives them of their basic social and instinctual needs. They are also den animals, preferring a safe and quiet place to rest, such as your house. A dog who resides more in a home than in the yard is a much happier and trainable animal, because of the security of a den and the companionship of the (human) “pack”.
Dogs that are tethered for prolonged periods of time are also more likely to exhibit signs of stress or being anxious (digging, barking, howling or whining, chewing, and hyperactivity). Walking a dog on a leash, playing, and spending time with it in the house can relieve these symptoms. Keep in mind, dogs that are usually tethered when outside will be more likely pull on
11-8
a leash when walked because they are used to the tension of the tether and pull against it. It may take some training and patience to get them used to walks on leashes.
Recommendations
• When tethered, the dog is in visual range of the responsible party. As dogs may cause a nuisance, become injured, or knock over water bowls, it is advisable for the responsible party to be available to take immediate action for such situations.
• Dogs have a buckle-type collar made of nylon or leather, with current dog license and ID tag attached, when connected to a tether. This type of collar is less likely to cause injury to the neck. There should be enough room between the collar and the dog’s throat through which two adult fingers may fit.
• Dogs are tethered to a pulley, running line, or trolley system as opposed to a stationary object. The tether will be less likely to knock over water and food bowls and gives the dog more ample space for exercise.
• The dog is at least six months of age when being tethered.
• In the winter months, use heated water bowls outside to prevent drinking water from freezing. Heated water bowls are available at most major pet supplies stores.
• Consider putting up a mesh fence around your yard, instead of tethering. It is one the simplest and cheapest types of fencing available.

The applicant may request, and the authorized permitting agency may grant, a waiver from any information requirements it judges to be unnecessary to the review of a particular plan. Note that for projects that involve a Notice of Intent to the Conservation Commission, submission of the Stormwater Report and Plan under the Notice of Intent shall suffice as the submission for said stormwater management permit, provided that it contains all information required under this Ordinance.
c. Procedures for review and approval of stormwater permits
1. A Stormwater Management Plan (or an application for waiver) shall be submitted to the authorized permitting agency for review and approval for any proposed development specified in Section 12-78. Eight copies of the Stormwater Management Plan shall be submitted (along with all other documents required for any zoning or subdivision permits/approvals when required).
12-28
2. The procedures for review and approval of Stormwater Management Plans shall be consistent with review procedures of the authorized permitting agency, as appropriate to the use.
3. The authorized permitting agency shall refer copies of the Stormwater Management Plan to other appropriate city departments for review, and shall consider any comments submitted by said departments during the review period.
4. The authorized permitting agency need not hold a public hearing for projects or activities outside the currently regulated jurisdictions of existing city boards, commissions, and/or departments. For stormwater permit applications that are included as part of applications for activities and projects that require other permit approvals within the currently regulated jurisdictions of existing town boards, commissions, and/or departments, a public hearing will be held in accordance with established procedures for these other permits. A public hearing shall be held when requested by at least five members of the public.
d. Criteria for review of Stormwater Management Plans.
In addition to other criteria used by the authorized permitting agency in making permit decisions, for the uses specified in this Ordinance, said authorized permitting agency must also find that the Stormwater Management Plan submitted with the permit application meets the following criteria:
1. The Stormwater Management Plan is consistent with the purposes and objectives of Section 12-76;
2. The Stormwater Management Plan meets the performance standards described in Section 12-81; and,
3. The Stormwater Management Plan meets the design requirements in Section 12-81.
E. Authorized permitting agency action.
The authorized permitting agency's action, rendered in writing, shall consist of either:
1. Approval of the stormwater management permit application based upon determination that the proposed Stormwater Management Plan meets the purposes in Section 12-76, the standards in Section 12-81, and is in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Ordinance; or,
2. Approval of the stormwater management permit application subject to any conditions, modifications or restrictions required by the board which will ensure that the project meets the purposes in Section 12-76 and the performance standards in Section 12-81; or,
3. Disapproval of the stormwater management permit application based upon a determination that the proposed Stormwater Management Plan, as submitted, does not meet the purposes in Section 12-76 and the performance standards in Section 12-81 to adequately protect water resources, as set forth in this Ordinance.
Failure of the authorized permitting agency to take final action upon a complete application within 45 days shall be deemed to be approval of said application, unless the stormwater permit application is part of other permit approvals in which case already established time frames for the other permits shall take precedence. Upon certification by the city clerk that the allowed time has passed without authorized permitting agency action, the authorized permitting agency must issue a stormwater management permit.
12-29
f. Inspections
No plan will be approved without adequate provision for inspection of the property before development activity commences. The applicant shall arrange with the authorized permitting agency (or its appointed agent) for scheduling inspections, or upon request by the authorized permitting agency, shall have a qualified third party as determined by the City Engineer perform the inspections and submit a detailed report as to their findings. Inspections may include the following:
1. Initial inspection prior to approval of any plan;
2. Erosion control inspections after site clearing, rough grading and final grading to ensure erosion control practices are in accord with the plan;
3. Bury inspection prior to backfilling of any underground drainage or stormwater conveyance structures; and,
4. Final inspection when all work, including construction of stormwater management facilities and landscaping have been completed.
For construction activities disturbing less than 1 acre of land, but more than 10,000 square feet that are not part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb greater than one acre, inspection activities may be limited at the discretion of the City Engineer to an erosion control inspection (number 2 above) and a final inspection (number 4 above).
Inspection reporting shall either approve it or notify the applicant in writing in what respects there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of the approved plan. Any portion of the work which does not comply shall be promptly corrected by the applicant or the applicant will be subject to the bonding provisions of Section 12-81(g) or the penalty provisions of Section 12-81(h). The authorized permitting agency or its agent may conduct random inspections to ensure effective control of erosion and sedimentation during all phases of construction.
G. Right of entry for inspection.
The filing of a Stormwater Management Permit application or the filing of an application form with the Building Inspector for activities defined in Section 12-78(c), shall be deemed as the property owner's permission to the authorized permitting agency, or its agent, for the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of the inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this Ordinance is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction a violation.
h. Fees.
For construction projects disturbing an acre or more of land, a non-refundable Permit Application Fee of $300.00 must accompany the application.
For construction projects disturbing less than an acre of land, but more than 10,000 square feet that are not part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb greater than one acre, a non-refundable Permit Application Fee of $100.00 must accompany the application form.
This fee schedule is reasonably related to the costs of processing, reviewing, acting upon the application, and conducting inspections. The fee shall be made payable to the City of Easthampton and shall accompany the permit application. The City may require an additional fee for review of any change in or alteration from an approved permit.
12-30
Said fee shall be paid into a special account set up by the City Treasurer and may be expended by the authorized permitting and enforcement agencies for the purpose allocated without further appropriation in accordance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 53E 1/2.

Sec. 12-81. Stormwater Management Performance Standards.
a. Minimum control requirements for construction activities disturbing one acre or more.
Projects that require a permit under this Ordinance, and that involve construction activities that disturb one acre or more, must meet the following standards:
1. No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.
2. On sites that have not been previously developed (including agricultural sites and sites that have not been previously improved with buildings or impervious surfaces), stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development peak discharge rates do not exceed predevelopment peak discharge rates.
3. Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of infiltration measures, including but not limited to environmentally sensitive site design, low impact development techniques, stormwater best management practices, and good operation and maintenance, to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from the post-development site should approximate the annual recharge rate from the predevelopment or existing site conditions, based on soil types.
4. Stormwater management systems must be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual load (post development conditions) of total suspended solids (TSS).
5. For land uses with higher potential pollutant loads, source control and pollution prevention shall be implemented in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook to eliminate or reduce the discharge of stormwater runoff from such land uses to the maximum extent practicable. The use of infiltration practices without pretreatment is prohibited.
6. Stormwater discharges within the Zone II or Interim Wellhead Protection Area of a public water supply, and stormwater discharges near or to any other critical area, require the use of the specific source control and pollution prevention measures and the specific structural stormwater best management practices determined to be suitable for managing discharges to such area, as provided by the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook. Stormwater discharges to a Zone 1 or Zone A are prohibited unless essential to the operation of the public water supply.
7. Redevelopment projects must meet stormwater management standards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the maximum extent practicable. For projects other than Transportation Projects, determination of ‘maximum extent practicable’ shall result from completion of an alternatives analysis that conforms to Section 12-80(b), #15. Transportation Projects shall conform to requirements of the Mass Highway Stormwater Handbook. A redevelopment project must comply with all other requirements of the stormwater management standards and improve existing conditions. Components of redevelopment projects that include development of previously undeveloped areas must meet all the stormwater management standards.
8. Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to prevent impacts during disturbance and construction activities.
9. All stormwater management systems must have an operation and maintenance plan to ensure that systems function as designed (see Section 12-81f of this Ordinance).
12-34
When the proposed discharge may have an impact upon a sensitive receptor, including streams, wetlands, vernal pools, storm sewers, and/or combined sewers, the authorized permitting agency may require an increase in these minimum requirements, based on existing stormwater system capacity.
b. Minimum control requirements for construction activities disturbing less than one acre of land, but more than 10,000 square feet that are not part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb greater than one acre.
Projects that involve construction activities that disturb less than one acre of land, but more than 10,000 square feet and are not part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb greater than one acre must meet the following standards:
1. No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.
2. On sites that have not been previously developed (including agricultural sites and sites that have not been previously improved with buildings or impervious surfaces), stormwater management and low impact development measures must be designed so that runoff from at least one half of the impervious areas at the site are directed toward grassy or vegetated areas, or are infiltrated, treated, or retained using rain gardens, cisterns, drywells, or other measures included in the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook.
3. Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of infiltration measures, including but not limited to environmentally sensitive site design, low impact development techniques, and stormwater best management practices to the maximum extent practicable.
4. Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to prevent impacts during disturbance and construction activities.
5. All stormwater management systems must have an operation and maintenance plan to ensure that systems function as designed (see Section 12-81f of this Ordinance).
c. Stormwater management measures
1. Stormwater management measures shall be required to satisfy the minimum control requirements and shall be implemented in the following order of preference:
a. Infiltration, flow attenuation, and pollutant removal of runoff on site to existing areas with grass, trees, and similar vegetation and through the use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions;
b. Use of stormwater on site to replace water used in industrial processes or for irrigation;
c. Stormwater detention structures for the temporary storage of runoff which is designed so as not to create a permanent pool of water; and
d. Stormwater retention structures for the permanent storage of runoff by means of a permanent pool of water; and,
e. Detention and evaporation of stormwater on rooftops or in parking lots.
2. Infiltration practices shall be utilized to reduce runoff volume increases. A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control requirements.
3. Best management practices shall be employed to minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff prior to discharge into a separate storm drainage system or water body.
12-35
4. All stormwater management facilities shall be designed to provide an emergency overflow system, and incorporate measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along its length and at any outfall.
5. The designed release rate of any stormwater structure shall be modified if any increase in flooding or stream channel erosion would result at a downstream dam, highway, structure, or normal point of restricted stream flow.
6. Stormwater best management practices that mimic natural hydrology (i.e., nonstructural and small-scale upland management approaches) should be considered as first-line practices. Given appropriate soils and conditions, all opportunities to use nonstructural and small-scale upland management designs must be exhausted prior to exploring end-of-pipe stormwater management approaches.
d. Specific design criteria.
Additional policy, criteria, and information including specifications and design standards may be found in the stormwater design manual.
1. All projects subject to this Ordinance must consider the following environmentally sensitive site design and Low Impact Development (LID) techniques:
a. Identify, map and preserve the site’s natural features and environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, native vegetation, mature trees, slopes, drainage ways, permeable soils, flood plains, woodlands, and prime agricultural soils to the maximum extent practicable;
B. Minimize grading and clearing;
c. Delineate potential building envelopes, avoiding environmental resource areas and appropriate buffers by clustering buildings and reducing building footprints;
d. Develop methods to minimize impervious surfaces, and protect and preserve open space. Reduce impervious surfaces where ever possible through alternative street design, such as omission of curbs and use of narrower streets, shared driveways and through the use of shared parking areas;
e. Manage runoff using smaller, decentralized, low-tech stormwater management techniques to treat and recharge stormwater close to the source; lengthen flow paths and maximize sheet flow;
f. Use nonstructural, low-tech methods including open drainage systems, disconnection of roof runoff and street sweeping where possible;
g. Use native plant vegetation in buffer strips and in rain gardens (small planted depressions that can trap and filter runoff);
h. Use of vegetation that does not require irrigation during periods of drought; and,
i. Integrate the following techniques into the site design to create a hydrologically functional site, including but not limited to the following:
i. Grass swales along roads;
ii. Rain gardens;
iii. Buffer strips;
Iv. Use of roof gardens where practicable;
v. Use of amended soils that will store, filter and infiltrate runoff;

d. Infiltration systems designed to handle runoff from commercial or industrial impervious parking areas shall be a minimum of 100 feet from any drinking water supply well;
e. Infiltration systems shall not be used as sediment control basins during construction unless specific plans are included to restore or improve the basin surface;
f. Infiltration basins shall be constructed with a three foot minimum separation between the bottom of the structure and the seasonal high groundwater elevation, as determined by a certified soil evaluator; and,
g. Provisions shall be made for safe overflow passage, in the event of a storm which exceeds the capacity of an infiltration system.
3. Retention and detention ponds
Retention and detention ponds shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria of the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook: Volume 2 Technical Guide for Compliance with Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standard (Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, February 2008), as updated or amended.
4. Natural topography and land cover
The applicant shall give consideration in any plan to incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as natural swales, and depressions as they exist prior to development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of water.
5. Swales
The authorized permitting agency shall give preference to the use of swales in place of the traditional use of curbs and gutters based on a case by case review of Stormwater Management Plans by the city engineer and authorized permitting agency.
6. Public Safety
The applicant shall consider public safety in the design of any stormwater facilities. The banks of detention, retention, and infiltration basins shall be sloped at a gentle grade into the water as a safeguard against personal injury, to encourage the growth of vegetation and to allow the alternate flooding and exposure of areas along the shore. Basins shall have a four-to-one slope to a depth two feet below the control elevation. Side slopes must be stabilized and planted with vegetation to prevent erosion and provide pollutant removal. The banks of detention and retention areas shall be designed with sinuous rather than straight shorelines so that the length of the shoreline is maximized, thus offering more space for the growth of vegetation;
7. Where a Stormwater Management Plan involves direction of some or all runoff off of the site, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain from adjacent property owners any easements or other necessary property interests concerning flowage of water. Approval of a Stormwater Management Plan does not create or affect any such rights.
8. All applicants for projects which involve the storage or use of hazardous chemicals shall incorporate handling and storage "best management practices" that prevent such chemicals from contaminating runoff discharged from a site into infiltration systems, receiving water bodies or storm drains, and shall include a list of such chemicals in the application and the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each listed chemical.
12-37
9. Runoff from parking lots and streets shall be treated by oil and water separators or other controls to remove oil and sediment;
10. The basic design criteria methodologies and construction specifications, subject to the approval of the authorized permitting agency and review and recommendation of the city engineer, shall be those generally found in the most current edition of the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook: Volume 2 Technical Guide for Compliance with Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standard (Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, February 2008), as updated or amended.
e. Design requirements for construction related activities.

If the amount due is not received by the expiration of the time in which to file a protest or within 30 days following a decision of the Board of Public Works affirming or reducing the costs, or from a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the costs shall become a special assessment against the property owner and shall constitute a lien on the owner's property for the amount of said costs. Interest shall begin to accrue on any unpaid costs at the statutory rate provided in M.G.L.A. c. 59, § 57 after the 31st day at which the costs first become due.

12-44
accordance with Section 10 of Chapter 83 of the Massachusetts General Laws, be subject to a civil penalty of $5,000 for each day such violation occurs or continues, which may be assessed in an action brought on behalf of the City of Easthampton in any court of competent jurisdiction together with such equitable relief as is appropriate.

This resolution demonstrates the City's ongoing practice of providing a welcoming community for all residents, visitors, and those who work in our City.

 All privately owned hedges, walls or other enclosures shall be no closer to the sidewalk, street right-of-way, or property lines than three feet.  All fences in residential zones can be located up to, but not on any property line.  For agricultural uses on parcels greater than five acres, or where abutting property owners agree, a fence may closer to the property line or along the property line.   (Amended by City Council 01-19-1999; approved by Mayor on 01-20-1999.  Further amended by the City Council on 04-06-2004; approved by the Mayor on 04-07-2004).

7.0 AQUIFER PROTECTION DISTRICT 
 
7.01 Purpose of the District 
 
To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the community and to protect and preserve the groundwater resources of the city from adverse development and land use practices that might reduce the quality or quantity of water that is now, and in the future will be, available for use by municipalities, individuals and industries. 
 
7.02 Scope of Authority 
 
The Aquifer Protection District is an overlay district and shall be super-imposed on the other zoning districts.  All provisions of the zoning ordinance of the City of Easthampton applying to the district so overlaid shall remain valid and in full force and effect. 
 
7.03 Establishment and Delineation of Aquifer Protection District 
 
a. For the purposes of this district, there is hereby established within the city, an aquifer recharge area, which has been defined by standard geologic and hydrologic investigations.  This district consists of lands lying within the primary and secondary aquifer recharge of groundwater aquifers or within one-half mile radius of wells which now, or may in the future, provide public water supply within the boundaries of the City of Easthampton. 
 
b. The boundaries of this district are delineated on a map at a scale of one inch to eight hundred (800) feet entitled, "Aquifer Protection District," City of Easthampton, on file in the office of the City Clerk. 
 
c. Where the bounds as delineated are in doubt or in dispute, the burden of proof shall be upon the owner(s) of the land in question to show where they should be properly located.  At the request of the owner(s), the city may engage a professional geologist, hydrogeologist, soil scientist or engineer trained and experienced in hydrogeology, to determine more accurately the location and extent of an aquifer or recharge area, and may charge the owner(s) for all or part of the investigation. 
 
7.04 Definitions 
 
 Aquifer:  A geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that contains sufficient saturated permeable material to yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs. 
 
 Artificial recharge:  Recharge at a rate greater than natural, resulting from deliberate or incidental actions of man.

g. In accordance with the State Plumbing Code, all vehicle maintenance facilities must have floor drains, unless they receive a variance from the State Plumbing Board, which must be connected to a municipal sewer system or to a state-approved holding tanks in unsewered areas.  All other facilities which use, store or maintain hazardous materials or wastes must, with state approval, seal floor drains or connect them to a sewer system or holding tank. 
 
h. With the exception of bridges, the area within 75 feet of Broad Brook shall be kept in a natural vegetated condition and not altered in any way. 
 
i. The following standards for urban stormwater run-off control apply: 
 
(1) For commercial and industrial uses, to the extent feasible, run-off from impervious surface shall be recharged on the site by stormwater infiltration basins or similar systems covered with natural vegetation.  Such run-off shall not be discharged directly to rivers, streams, or other surface water bodies.  Dry wells shall be used only where other methods are infeasible.  All such basins and wells shall be preceded by oil, grease and sediment traps to facilitate removal of contamination.  All recharge areas shall be permanently maintained in full working order by the owner(s).  Infiltration systems greater than three-feet deep shall be located at least one hundred feet from drinking water wells, and shall be situated at least ten-feet down-gradient and one hundred-feet up-gradient from building foundations to avoid seepage problems.  Infiltration basins and trenches shall be constructed with a three-foot minimum separation between the bottom of the structure and maximum groundwater elevation. 
 
 (2) For commercial or industrial projects which will render impervious, by any means:  (a) more than ten (10) percent or up to twenty (20) percent of any single lot, or; (b) more than five (5) percent or up to ten (10) percent of lots of thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet or more; a system of artificial aquifer recharge of precipitation must be developed to retain stormwater runoff within the confines of the lot.  The management of stormwater and any artificial recharge systems developed shall be designed so as not to result in the degradation of groundwater.  A stormwater management plan shall be developed which provides for the artificial recharge of precipitation to groundwater, where feasible.  Recharge shall be attained through site design that incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation, and through the use of stormwater infiltration basins, infiltration trenches, porous pavement or similar systems.  All infiltration practices shall be preceded by oil, grease, and sediment traps or other best management practices to facilitate removal of contamination. 
 
(3) For residential uses, to the extent feasible, recharge shall be attained through site design that incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation.  To the extent possible, stormwater run-off from rooftops, driveways, roadways and other 
impervious surfaces shall be routed through areas of natural vegetation and/or devices such as infiltration basins, infiltration trenches or similar systems. 
 
(4) Infiltration practices shall be utilized to reduce run-off volume increases to the extent possible as determined in accordance with infiltration standards and specifications established by the Soil Conservation Service.  A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the desired control requirements.  Justification shall be provided by the person developing land for rejecting each practice based on site conditions.  Any and all recharge areas shall be permanently maintained in full working order by the owner.  Provisions for maintenance shall be described in the stormwater management plan. 
 
j. The application of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers for non-domestic or non-agricultural uses must be approved by the Board of Health. 
 
7.06 Procedures for Issuance of a Special Permit

Such nonconforming uses may be extended or altered, as specified in M.G.L. Ch. 40A, Sec. 6, and in compliance with Section 7.053 herein, provided that there is a finding by the Planning Board that such change does not increase the danger of surface or groundwater pollution from such use. 
 
7.1 FLOODPLAIN AND MANHAN RIVER PROTECTION DISTRICTS 
 
7.11 Purpose of the District 
 
The purposes of the Floodplain and Manhan River Protection Districts are to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, to protect human life and property from the hazards of periodic flooding, to reduce public costs resulting from unwise individual choices of land use, to preserve the natural flood control characteristics, and the flood storage of the floodplain, and to preserve and maintain the groundwater table and water recharge areas within the floodplain, to preserve the scenic qualities, fisheries and wildlife habitat along the Manhan River and to prevent water pollution. 
 
7.12 District Delineation 
 
a. The Floodplain District is herein established as an overlay district: 
 
(1) The general boundaries of the floodplain district are shown on the Easthampton Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), dated August 15, 1979, as Zones A, A1 through 30, to indicate the one hundred-year flood.  The exact boundaries of the district are defined by the one hundred-year water surface elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the flood profiles contained in the flood insurance study, dated February 1979.  The floodway boundaries are delineated on the Easthampton Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM), dated August 15, 1979, and further defined by the floodway data tables contained in the flood insurance study.  These two (2) maps as well as the accompanying study are incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the City Clerk, Planning Board, Building Inspector and the Conservation Commission. 
 
(2) Within Zone A, where the one hundred-year flood elevation is not provided on the FIRM the developer/applicant shall obtain any existing flood elevation data and it shall be reviewed by the conservation committee.  If the data is sufficiently detailed and accurate, it shall be relied upon to require compliance with this ordinance and the state building code. 
 
(3) In Zone A, the best available federal, state, local, or other floodway data shall be used to prohibit encroachments in floodways which would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  In Zones A1-A30 and AE, along water courses that have not had a regulatory floodway designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development shall be permitted unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood.  In Zones A1-A30 and AE, along water courses that have regulatory floodways designated on the Easthampton FIRM encroachments are prohibited in the regulatory floodway which would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
 
b. The Manhan River Protection District is herein established as an overlay district: 
 
(1) The area subject to the ordinance shall be the entire length of the Manhan River in Easthampton.  The Manhan River Protection District shall encompass those floodplain areas designated as Zones A or Zone A 1-30 on the City of Easthampton Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for the Manhan River.

that all plans referred to in the decision are on file with the PAA.  If twenty (20) days have elapsed after the decision has been filed in the office of the City Clerk without an appeal having been filed or if such appeal, having been filed, is dismissed or denied, the City Clerk shall so certify on a copy of the decision. If a plan is approved by reason of the failure of the PAA to timely act, the City Clerk shall make such certification on a copy of the application.  A copy of the decision or application bearing such certification shall be recorded in the registry of deeds for the county and district in which the land is located and indexed in the grantor index under the name of the owner of record or recorded and noted on the owner's certificate of title. The fee for recording or registering shall be paid by the applicant. 
 
7.4116  Validity of Decision. A Plan Approval shall remain valid and shall run with the land indefinitely, provided that construction has commenced within two years after the decision is issued, which time shall be extended by the time required to adjudicate any appeal from such approval and which time shall also be extended if the Project proponent is actively pursuing other required permits for the Project or there is other good cause for the failure to commence construction, or as may be provided in a Plan Approval for a multi-phase Project.

Such minor changes must be submitted to the PAA on redlined prints of the approved plan, reflecting the proposed change, and on application forms provided by the PAA.  The PAA may authorize such changes at any regularly scheduled meeting, without the need to hold a public hearing.  The PAA shall set forth any decision to approve or deny such minor change by motion and written decision, and provide a  copy to the applicant for filing with the City Clerk. 
 
7.4122  Major Change. Those changes deemed by the PAA to constitute a major change in a Project because of the nature of the change in relation to the prior approved plan, or because such change cannot be appropriately characterized as a minor change as described above, shall be processed by the PAA as a new application for Plan Approval pursuant to Sections 7.49 - through 7.413. 
 
 
7.413     DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
7.4131  Adoption and Amendment of Design Standards.

c. Housing constructed by a public agency or nonprofit corporation using a federal, state or local housing assistance program may adhere to the requirements set forth by the funding agency provided that the intent of these regulations are met. 
 
d. Affordable housing units shall be geographically dispersed throughout the development. 
 
9.1.6 OSR Development Design Guidelines 
 
9.1.6.1 Vehicular and Pedestrian Circulation 
 
a. Primary routes shall be clearly differentiated from secondary routes and driveways; conflicts shall be minimized between vehicular routes and pedestrian routes and recreation areas. 
 
b. Roadways shall be laid out so as to minimize long vistas of pavement and monotonous linear arrangements of buildings. 
 
9.1.6.2 Screening and Buffers 
 
a. Layout and design shall respond to needs for privacy between and around dwelling units; structures shall be arranged to maximize the preservation of existing trees and tree groves. 
 
b. All residential structures and accessory uses within the development shall be set back from the boundaries of the development by a buffer strip of at least fifty (50) feet in width.  A buffer of one hundred (100) feet in width from existing roads which shall be kept in a natural or landscaped condition. 
 
9.1.6.3 Open Space/Common Land 
 
a. The total area of open space required shall be at least fifty (50) percent of the total parcel area, of which at least seventy-five (75) percent shall be neither bordering vegetated wetlands (as defined in M.G.L. Ch. 131, Section 40, the Wetlands Protection Act and 310 CMR), shall be set aside as Common Open Space.  A functional relationship shall exist between the Common Open Space areas and the proposed residential clusters in an OSR Development. 
 
(1) Such Common Open Space shall be restricted to open space agricultural uses, recreational uses such as tot-lot, park, playground, play field, golf course or conservation. 
 
(2) Such Common Open Space shall have suitable access to and from the development's street(s). 
 
(3) Such Common Open Space shall be placed under a Conservation Restriction/Easement in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 184, Sections 31-33 as amended.  Such common land shall be either deeded to (1) a corporation or trust comprising a home association whose membership includes the owners of all lots or units contained in the tract.  The developer shall include in the deed to owners of individual lots beneficial rights in said open land, and shall grant a conservation restriction to the City of Easthampton over such land pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 184, section 31-33, to insure that such land be kept in an open or natural state and not be built upon the residential use or developed for accessory uses such as parking or roadways; (2) to a non-profit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space.  The developer or charity shall grant a conservation restriction as set out in (1) above; or (3) to the Conservation Commission of the city for park or open space use, subject to the approval of the selectmen, with a trust clause insuring that it will be maintained as 
open space.  A homes association organization shall be created by covenants running with the land, and such covenants shall be included with the submitted development plan and shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board. 
 
Such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open space by sale or otherwise (except to an organization conceived and organized to own and maintain the common open space), without first offering to dedicate the same to the city. 
 
Covenants creating such organization shall provide that in the event the organization established to own and maintain common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time after establishment of the development fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the development plan, the city may serve notice in writing upon such organization or upon the residents of the development setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall contain a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a public hearing thereon which shall be held within twenty (20) days of the notice.  At such hearing the city may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may grant an extension of time within which they shall be cured.  If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be cured within said thirty (30) days or any extension thereof, the city in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and maintain the same for one year.  Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common open space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners.  Before the expiration of said one-year period, the city shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization therefore responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon notice in writing to such organization or to the residents of such development, to be held by the Planning Board, at which hearing the organization shall show cause why such maintenance by the city shall not continue for a succeeding one-year period.  The Planning Board shall send recommendations for further action, if any, to the City Council. 
 
If the Planning Board determines that such organization is ready and able to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition at the end of said one-year period, the organization shall maintain the property.  If the Planning Board determines that such organization is not ready and able to maintain the common open space in a reasonable condition, the city may, in its discretion, continue to maintain the common open space during the next succeeding year, and subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year thereafter.  The covenants creating such organization shall further provide that the cost of such maintenance by the city shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a charge of said properties, and such charge shall be paid by the owners of said properties within thirty (30) days after receipt of a statement therefore. 
 
The covenants shall provide that each dwelling unit shall have an equal say in determining the affairs of the organization; that costs shall be assessed equally to each dwelling unit; and that the organization shall be retained in the control of the 
developer no longer than until a majority of dwelling units are conveyed to permanent owners. 
 
Where appropriate, and with the approval of the City Council, by virtue of the large size of a development or of the diversity of uses or dwelling types therein, more than one separate and distinct organization may be created.  Separate organizations may not be created, however, where one might be too small (in terms of the number of lots included) to operate efficiently, or where one has a responsibility for too large or costly (to maintain) parcel of open space in proportion to that under the responsibility of other organizations within the same development. 
 
(4) Open space liens:  Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of organization costs, and the assessments levied by the association can become a lien upon the property. 
 
b. The majority of the common land shall consist of large blocks of contiguous areas easily accessible to most residents of the development from streets, cul-de-sacs and other open areas and linkages between different sections of common land shall be clearly shown; physical and visual access to the common land from the dwelling units, the preservation of the original land form and existing vegetation shall be maximized. 
 
c. Where the proposed development abuts a body of water, a portion of the shoreline, as well as reasonable access to it, shall be a part of the residual common land. 
 
9.1.6.4 Utilities and Services 
 
a. Dumpsters, if applicable, shall be located in convenient locations, visually screened and shall not impede pedestrian or vehicular circulation. 
 
b. The installation and location of drainage systems shall not impede access to common land. 
 
9.1.6.5 Protection of Environmentally Sensitive Areas 
 
a. The Planning Board may reduce the number of lots otherwise allowed for the protection of aquifers, wetlands, or other environmentally sensitive areas. 
 
b. Wildlife habitats of species listed as endangered, threatened or of special concern by the Massachusetts Natural Heritage Program will be protected. 
 
c. Historic and prehistoric sites and their environs will be preserved. 
  
9.1.6.6 Building Lot Layout and Siting 
 
a. The Planning Board may request the establishment of building envelopes for buildings in particularly sensitive areas within the OSR development. 
 
b. Residences should be grouped in locations so that the greatest number of units can be designed to take advantage of solar heating opportunities; scenic views and long vistas will remain unblocked particularly as seen from public roads, special places or scenic roads. 
 
c. In areas within two hundred (200) feet from open bodies of water (reservoirs, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams), lots shall be laid out, to the greatest extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives: 
 
(1) On a portion of the site that will most likely conserve shoreline vegetation and the integrity of the buffer strip. 
 
(2) Integrated into the existing landscape through features such as vegetative buffers and through retention of the natural shorelines. 
 
(3) Will not result in erosion or sedimentation. 
 
(4) Will not result in water pollution. 
 
(5) Prevent any disruptions to the natural flow of the water course. 
 
(6) Protect fisheries and wildlife habitat within and along the water course. 
 
(7) Enhance and preserve existing agricultural lands, floodplain and other environmentally sensitive areas along the shoreline. 
 
(8) An uncut buffer strip of native vegetation shall be maintained fifty (50) feet back from the bank of any affected water course, within which limited limb removal may be permitted to create filtered views and within which unpaved woodland paths may be created subject to Conservation Commission approval. 
 
(9) Minimum set-backs from the bank for structures shall be one hundred (100) feet. 
 
d. In areas of greater than ten to fifteen (10-15) percent average slope or upon hilltops or ridgelines, lots shall be laid out, to the greatest extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives: 
 
(1) Building sites shall be located so that building silhouettes will be below the ridgeline or hilltop or if the site is heavily wooded, the building silhouettes shall be at least ten (10) feet lower than the average canopy height of trees on the ridge or hilltop. 
 
(2) The placement of buildings, structures, or signs shall not detract from the site's scenic qualities or obstruct significant views, and shall blend with the natural landscape. 
(3) Where public views will be unavoidably affected by the proposed use, architectural and landscaped measures shall be employed so as to minimize significant degradation of the existing scenic or aesthetic qualities of the site. 
 
(4) Foundations shall be constructed to reflect the natural slope of the terrain. 
 
(5) Preference should be given to exterior facades that utilize building materials which blend with the natural wooded landscape, both in texture and darker color. 
 
(6) The removal of native vegetation or trees shall be minimized to the extent feasible in clearing sites for new structures and roads.  In landscaping, preference shall be given to native trees and plants in order to maintain the natural character. 
 
(7) Any grading or earth-moving operation in conjunction with the proposed development shall be planned and executed in such a manner that the final contours are consistent with the existing terrain, both on and adjacent to the site. 
 
(8) Safeguards shall be employed where needed to mitigate against environmental degradation from erosion, sedimentation, water pollution or flooding. 
 
(9) The siting of roads, utilities and buildings shall be laid out to minimize the alteration of the existing surficial geography. 
 
e. In agricultural areas, lots shall be laid out, to the greatest extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives (listed in order of priority, as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any given site): 
 
(1) On the most suitable soils for subsurface septic disposal (in areas not served by municipal or private waste treatment facilities only); 
 
(2) On the least fertile areas for agricultural uses, and in a manner which maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural uses; 
 
(3) Within any woodland contained in the parcel, or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland (to reduce impact upon agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind, and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features); 
 
(4) In such a manner that the common boundary between the new house lots and the preserved farmland is designed to reduce potential conflict situations; 
 
(5) In locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas, as seen from the public roadway(s); 
 
(6) Provide buffers between all dwelling units and non-agricultural structures as much as practicable to minimize conflicts between farming operations and residents.

9.32  Transfer of Development Rights: 
 
a.  Transfer of Development Rights provides for increased density of residential and commercial development in the designated Receiving Area, when suitable open space land in the Sending Area, is permanently preserved from development.  The transfer of development rights is accomplished by the execution of a Conservation Restriction, and the increased density is permitted by the issuance of a Special Permit, both as hereinafter provided.  The Transfer of Development Rights shall conform in all respects to Section 6.10 of this ordinance, and in no event shall a Receiving Area be allowed to exceed the limitations set forth therein.  (Subsection 9.32 amended by the City Council on June 17, 2015; approved by the Mayor on June 18, 2015). 
 
9.33  Eligibility:  
 
a.   All lots shown on a plan, or described in a deed, recorded at the Registry of Deeds in the Sending Area are eligible to apply for a Special Permit from the Planning Board to transfer all or part of the development rights on the lot to a lot in the Receiving Area.  
 
9.34  Establishment of Sending Area and Receiving Area: 
 
a.   The following districts are hereby established: 
(1) Sending Area; 
(2) Receiving Area. 
These districts are delineated on the Transfer of Development Rights Map of Easthampton, which is incorporated by reference as part of the Zoning Ordinance. 
 
9.35  Special Permit Process for Transfer of Development Rights: 
 
a.   The applicant proposing to develop specified land in the Receiving Area at a density allowed by this ordinance with transfer of development rights shall make an application to the Planning Board for a Special Permit.

(2) Subtracting 5% of the total remaining parcel acreage, to account for land which would be used for roads if the parcel had been developed. 
(3) After determining the remaining land area, determining the number of lots allowable in the Sending Area based on a conceptual development plan; 
c.   The Planning Board shall review the applicant’s assessment of acreage eligible for transfer, and shall make a final determination of such acreage eligible for transfer. 
 
d.   The applicant shall also file with the Planning Board a preliminary development plan for the parcel in the Receiving Area, illustrating lots created using the transferred development rights, and illustrating all wetland and floodplain areas.  
 
e.

9.36  Receiving Area Regulations: 
 
1.  The Planning Board shall not approve a Special Permit for Transfer of Development Rights for a project which is not served by public sewer and water lines in the Receiving Area. 
 
9.37  Dimensional and Density Regulations Allowed By the Transfer of Development Rights: 
 
a.   Each residential building lot within the Sending Area is equivalent to one of the development rights in the Receiving Area shown in the Table of Exchange Standards for Transfer of Development Rights, found below in this section. 
 
Table 1.   EXCHANGE STANDARDS FOR TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS 
 
Sending Area 
 Receiving Area 
 Notes 
 
1 residential building lot equals 
 2000 s.f. of additional commercial or industrial floor area, plus a 5% increase in building coverage for a single commercial or industrial lot, or 
 1) “Additional commercial or industrial floor area” shall be defined as floor area above that which would normally be permitted in the underlying district, under Table 6-2 the Easthampton Zoning Ordinance.  The Planning Board may allow an increase in building coverage from the maximum building coverage required in Table 6-2, up to a maximum 75% building coverage for commercial or industrial uses.    
 
 
 
 1.2 residential building units, plus a 5% increase in building coverage, or 
 2) An additional 10% increase in the number of units may be allowed if the development provides for affordable home ownership.  Affordable housing shall be as defined in Section 8.69 and controlled by deed. 
 
 
 1 neighborhood commercial building lot 
 3) See Section 9.42 for commercial uses allowed on a neighborhood building lot within a Traditional Neighborhood Development.  Only one “neighborhood commercial building lot” may be approved per ten residential building lots within a TND. 
 

 
b.  For development rights purchased for every one (1) lot meeting minimum dimensional requirements for the underlying Rural Residential District within the Sending Area, the developer can add 1.2 residential lots or one neighborhood commercial lot in a Traditional Neighborhood Development in the Receiving Area above what could normally be built under Residential A standards, provided the dimensional requirements indicated in Section 9.37, Table 2, of this Ordinance and other requirements of the ordinance are met. Fractions of building lots cannot be rounded up to the next whole number.   
 
For example, if a developer buys the development rights to 14 buildable lots in the Sending Area, the developer is entitled to: 
   14 lots x 1.2 = 16.8 lots  
in addition to the underlying density in the Receiving Area.  However, since fractional lots cannot be built on, the developer can construct only 16 units (above what could normally be built under Residential A standards). 
 
c.   When a landowner wishes to sell less than the total number of development rights available to a tax parcel, the landowner may do so provided that the tax parcel is subdivided. 
 
d.   The maximum limits on density, building coverage, and parking reductions permitted to be developed by Special Permit in the Receiving Area shall be determined by reference to the Table of TDR Dimensional Standards for Receiving Areas found below in this section.

10.0 SIGNS 
 
10.01  Purposes 
The purposes of these sign regulations are:  to protect public health, safety and welfare: to encourage effect the effective use of signs as a means of communication in Easthampton; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and Easthampton’s ability to attract sources of economic development; to protect property values; and to reduce potential traffic hazards to motorists and pedestrians, and to allow on-premise sign owners the ability to adequately identify their locations and promote their goods, services and/or products. 
 
10.02  Applicability 
a.  The provisions of this section shall apply to the construction, erection, alteration, use, location, and maintenance of all signs located out of doors. 
 
b.   No sign shall be permitted except those which refer to a permitted use or an approved accessory use as set forth in Table 5-1 (Easthampton Table of Use Regulations) of this ordinance, provided such signs conform to the provisions of this Section. 
 
c.   A sign permit application including building and sign dimensions, colors, and attachment methods, may be made at the same time of application for a building permit.  When a building permit is not required, a sign permit may be issued in conjunction with an application for a Certificate of Occupancy. 
 
d.   Street and apartment numbers are not regulated under this ordinance. 
 
e.   Permits will be issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and permit fees shall be recommended  by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and approved by the Mayor.

impacts should be carefully documented and fully
referenced (see Appendix J) . Each of the sections of
said analysis (traffic, water, sewer, etc.) shall be
presented as a separate document so that it can be
forwarded by the Board to the appropriate Town
department in assessing the cumulative impact of
development on the Town. Regardless of the above, the
Board's decision shall be based on criteria set in
Section 1.02.
In order to insure the protection of the general public
against any possible undesirable impact of the

Detention Basin Design and Management
Detention Pond Policy
Town of Easthampton
Whereas detention basins or ponds are an increasingly popular
method of holding storrnwater for commercial and residential
developments, and
Whereas the Town of Easthampton recognizes the importance of the
use of detention basins in reducing water runoff; and
Whereas detention basins require some amount of maintenance to
ensure long-term effectiveness
The Town of Easthampton hereby establishes the following policy
for the maintenance and ownership of water detention basins and
ponds:
l?URPOSE
Due to recent policies desiring "no net site runoff", detention
basins have become a preferred method of stormwater management.
Basins are depressions in the land designed to hold the runoff
from a particular site during the 100-year storm. Water then
drains slowly to ground sources or slowly joins open streams.
Drainage systems shall conform to the follCMi.ng general drainage
principles: (1) maximize recharge, (2) minimize runoff, (3)
m1n1m1ze clearing for drainage, (4) m1n1m1ze erosion and
siltation, (5) minimize cost of the drainage system, and (6)
maintain the integrity of the natural drainage system (for
example, swales, kettle holes, and intermittent streams).
The purpose of this policy is to provide design guidelines as
well as to establish the short and long-term ownership and
maintenance responsibilities of the basins.
84
DESIGN
I. Soil Tests and Results
As required in the Development Impact Statement (DIS), soil
tests will be performed to determine the type of soil in the
proposed subdivision and the permeability of the soil. This
information is to be used to determine the design of the
stormwater detention/drainage system.
over permeable soils, generally, storrnwater shall be
detained so that it infiltrates the soil at or near the source,
and there is no net runoff from the site. over impermeable
soils, stormwater drainage systems shall be designed to maximize
the loss of pollutants and sedimentation prior to water
infiltrating or running off the site. Where both soil types are
present, the stormwater system should be designed such that the
retention systems drain to the detention areas where topography
allows; or two separate systems may be required.
II. Design Standards for Permeable Soils
1. To the extent possible, stormwater detention areas
shall make use of existing natural features including
topography and vegetation.
2. Vegetation and natural materials such as, but not
limited to, grasses, wetland plants, stone, and timbers
are preferred over concrete, "rip-rap", and other manmade
materials.
3. Detention areas shall be designed for the 100-year
storm.
4. Detention areas shall not allow standing water higher
than eighteen (18) inches for more than three days.
5. The side slopes of any detention area shall not exceed
a 1:4 slope.
III. Design Standards for Impermeable Soils
1. To the extent possible, storrnwater retention areas and
irrigation systems shall make use of existing natural
features.
2. Vegetation and natural materials such as, but not
limited to, grasses, wetland plants, stone, and timbers
are preferred over concrete, "rip-rap", and other manmade
materials.
85
3. Retention systems shall be designed for the 100-year
stonn.
4. Stormwater systems shall be designed as a series of
smaller retention/diversion areas rather than a single
large pond.
5. Retention areas shall have an overflow mechanism.
Dl. Interaction with other Recharge Methods
Detention areasjretention systems may be used in conjunction
with other recharge methods. These include, but are not limited
to, gabion weirs, rooftop pending, retention parking areas, dutch
drains, porous asphalt paving, lattice concrete blocks and
bricks, terraces, diversions, runoff spreaders, swales in series,
andjor seepage pits or beds.
OWNERSHIP
I. Commercial and Industrial Development
Detention basins in commercial or industrial developments
shall be owned by the developer, an individual owner, or a
group of owners on a separate parcel.
II. Residential Development
In residential developments, detention basins larger than
1,000 square feet shall be placed on their own lot(s) which
shall not be buildable. Access by way of a twenty foot
easement shall be provided to the detention pond lots.
These detention basins shall be owned by the developer until
such time as all the building lots are sold. At that time,
the ownership shall be placed with a homeowners association
established for this or other purposes.
Detention ponds which are smaller than 1,000 square feet may
be included as part of other building lots. OVmership of
the detention ponds is, therefore, conveyed with the lot.
An easement for access must still be provided to the Town.
MAINTENANCE
Regular maintenance is an important part in the long-tenn
continued effectiveness. A plan for maintenance of the detention
basin(s) and associated structures shall be included in the
submittal of any plan. This plan should include schedules for
mowing andjor trap cleaning, for example.
86
All detention basins shall have easements to the Town of
Easthampton in the event that the Town must provide additional
maintenance.
The responsibility of maintaining detention basins within a
development, commercial or residential, shall lie with the
developer until the infrastructure has been put in place and
all the lots have been sold.
At such time the detention basin maintenance shall either
remain the responsibility of the developer or shall be
transferred to a homeowners association.
The homeowners association may petition the Town to accept
the maintenance responsibility of the basin(s). This
request shall be brought to the Planning Board and must be
approved by the Planning Board and the Department of Public
Works.
INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT
The Town of Easthampton shall be responsible for ensuring that
the detention areas are being maintained. Toward this end, the
Town has the right to inspect the detention basins and to issue
requests that maintenance be performed.
In the event the maintenance is not performed, the Town may issue
fines of up to $100 per day per basin until the maintenance is
complete. If the Town must perform the maintenance itself, the
Town may bill the responsible party for the cost of labor.
