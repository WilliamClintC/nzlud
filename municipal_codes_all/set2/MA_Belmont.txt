This By-Law shall not apply to uses or structures lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or Special Permit issued, before the first publication of notice of the public hearing required by G.L. c. 40A, s. 5 at which this By-Law, or any relevant part thereof, was adopted.  No modification of a lawfully existing nonconforming use or structure is allowed except as authorized hereunder. 
1.5.2 Nonconforming Uses 
The Board of Appeals may grant a Special Permit to change or extend a nonconforming use only if it determines that such change or extension shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood and that it shall be in keeping with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located.  The following types of changes to nonconforming uses may be considered by the Board of Appeals: 
a. 	
Change or substantial extension of the use; 

b. 	
Change from one nonconforming use to another, not substantially more detrimental, nonconforming use. 


Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use through the exercise of a Building Permit, there is no authority to allow the property to revert to a nonconforming use. 
1.5.3 Nonconforming Structures 
The Building Commissioner may issue a Building Permit for a change in use of a pre­existing, nonconforming structure to any permitted use. 
The Building Commissioner may issue a Building Permit for an interior renovation, interior alteration or interior reconstruction of a pre-existing, nonconforming structure that does not extend the nonconformity or create a new nonconformity. 
The Board of Appeals may grant a Special Permit to reconstruct, extend, alter, or change a nonconforming structure only if it determines that such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure or create a new nonconformity and shall not be substantially more detrimental than the 
existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood and that it shall be in keeping with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located.  The following types of changes to nonconforming structures may be considered by the Board of Appeals: 
a. 	
A reconstruction, extension or structural change; 

b. 	
An alteration to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent. 


1.5.4 Nonconforming Single and Two-Family Residential Structures 
A. General Residence Zoning Districts 
(1) 
In the General Residence Zoning District, as provided in Massachusetts General Law Chapter 40A, Section 6, preexisting non-conforming structures may be extended or altered with a Special Permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals, provided that no such extension or alteration shall be permitted unless there is a finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that such extension or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, dormers that comply with Section 4.2.2, Linear Requirements, shall be allowed without review by the Zoning Board of Appeals. 

(2) 
If the Building Commissioner determines that such proposed alteration or structural change increases the gross floor area of the nonconforming structure by more than 300 square feet either as: 


a) 	a standalone application, in and of itself, or 
b) 	when combined with the gross floor area added to the structure during the five-year period preceding the date of the pending application, 
then the proposed alteration or structural change shall require a Special Permit from the Planning Board pursuant to Section 6D of this Zoning By-Law. 
(3) On lots that do not comply with the minimum area requirements of this Zoning By-Law (including the minimum lot area per dwelling unit), preexisting non-conforming single-and two-family structures may not be voluntarily demolished and reconstructed except in accordance with a Special Permit issued by the Planning Board under Section 6D of this Zoning By-Law. 
Note: §1.5.4 was amended by Article 4 at the 2018 Annual Town Meeting. §1.5.4 was amended by Article 14 at the 2014 Annual Town Meeting. 
B. Single Residence C Zoning Districts 
(1) In the Single Residence C Zoning Districts, a nonconforming single-and two-family residential structure may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the Building Commissioner that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or structural change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. 
The Building Commissioner may issue a Building Permit under any of the following circumstances: 
a) 	An alteration to a structure which complies with all current setbacks, open space, lot coverage and building height. This clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot complies with the current area and/or frontage requirements; 
b) 	An alteration to a structure which encroaches upon one or more required setbacks, where the alteration will comply with all current setbacks, open space, lot coverage and building height requirements.  This clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot complies with the current area and/or frontage requirements; 
c) 	A half-story addition to a nonconforming structure, that will not increase the footprint of the existing structure, create a new dimensional nonconformity or extend an existing dimensional nonconformity, provided that the existing height restrictions shall not be exceeded.  This clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot complies with the current area and/or frontage requirements. 
If the Building Commissioner determines that the proposed alteration or structural change does not meet any of the clauses listed above, a Special Permit shall be required from the Board of Appeals. 
(2) If the Building Commissioner determines that such proposed alteration or structural change increases the gross floor area of the nonconforming structure by more than thirty percent (30%) either as: 
a) 	A standalone application, in and of itself, or 
b) 	When combined with the gross floor area added to the structure during the five-year period preceding the date of the pending application 
then the proposed alteration or structural changes shall require a Special Permit from the Planning Board. 
(3) A nonconforming single-or two-family structure may be reconstructed after voluntary demolition if the building as reconstructed will be located on the same footprint as the original nonconforming structure, and will be no greater in volume or gross floor area as the original nonconforming structure. 
If the Building Commissioner determines that the proposed reconstruction would: 
a) 	cause the structure to exceed the volume or gross floor area of the original nonconforming structure or 
b) 	cause the structure to be located other than on the original footprint, 
then a Special Permit shall be required from the Planning Board prior to such 
reconstruction. 

(4) 
The Planning Board may grant a Special Permit under this Section 1.5.4.B. (2) or (3) if it finds that the enlarged building: a) Is generally in harmony with the neighborhood; b) Will neither generate excessive traffic, parking, noise or density impacts on the abutters, nor create other detrimental effects on the neighborhood; c) Is appropriate in scale and mass for the neighborhood, with particular consideration of abutting properties; d) Will not increase the existing nonconforming lot coverage, if it exists; and, 

e) 	Will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming building to the neighborhood. 

(5) 
In making any Special Permit decision pursuant to this Section 1.5.4.B. (2) or (3), the Planning Board shall consider the following: a) Scale and design of the structure; b) The siting of the structure and driveway; 


c) Walkway, driveway and parking circulation; 
d) Exterior lighting; 

e) 	Open space and screening; and, 
f) 	Drainage. 
(6) For the purposes of this Section 1.5.4.B., a nonconforming single-and two-family structure shall be defined as a single-and two-family structure on a lot that does not comply with the existing minimum lot area and/or frontage requirements and/or the single-and two-family structure encroaches or otherwise does not comply with one or more setbacks, open space, lot coverage or building height requirements. 
An application for a Special Permit under this Section 1.5.4.B. shall comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 7.4 of the Zoning By-Law. 
Note: §1.5.4 was amended by Article 6 at the 2016 Annual Town Meeting. 
C. All Other Districts 
In all other districts, nonconforming single and two-family residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the Building Commissioner that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or structural change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. The Building Commissioner may issue a Building Permit under the following circumstances: 
1) 	An alteration to a structure which complies with all current setbacks, open space, lot coverage and building height requirements but is located on a lot with insufficient area and/or frontage; 
2) 	An alteration to a structure which encroaches upon one or more required setbacks, where the alteration will comply with all current setbacks, open space, lot coverage and building height requirements. This clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot complies with the current area and/or frontage requirements; 
3) 	A half-story addition to a nonconforming structure, that will not increase the footprint of the existing structure, create a new dimensional nonconformity or extend an existing dimensional nonconformity, provided that the existing height restrictions shall not be exceeded.  This clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot complies with the current area and/or frontage requirements. 
1.5.5 Restoration 
A structure which has been damaged by fire or other casualty to an extent less than 50% of the fair market value of the structure on the date of the damage may be restored to its original condition and square footage, regardless of any nonconformity of the structure or its use. 
A structure damaged to a greater extent, if dimensionally nonconforming or containing a nonconforming use, may be restored to the previous nonconforming configuration or use only provided such work is started within two (2) years of the damage and completed within three (3) years of the date of the damage and where there is no increase in nonconformance with setback requirements. Any proposed change of use is subject to the provisions of this Section 1.5. 
1.5.6 Abandonment 
A nonconforming use of a structure or land, that has been abandoned or not used for a period of two (2) years, shall not be reestablished and all future use(s) shall conform with this By-Law. 
1.6 Variation 
Where this By-Law imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises than is imposed by existing provisions of law or other By-Laws, the provisions of this By-Law shall control. Where a provision of this By-Law may be in conflict with any other provision or provisions of this By-Law, the more stringent or greater requirements shall control.

3.5 Major Development 
3.5.1 Applicability 
Business developments as authorized in Section 3.3, Schedule of Use Regulations, require Concept Plan approval by Town Meeting under provisions of this Section prior to submittal for a Special Permit by the Board of Appeals, if resulting in more than 40,000 square feet gross floor area in any one or more business uses (as categorized in Section 3.3) on a lot or set of contiguous lots in the same ownership at any time subsequent to June 1, 1987, except for individual additions or alterations totaling less than 10% of the resultant gross floor area on the lot or set of lots. 
3.5.2 Concept Plan Approval 
Concept Plan Approval shall be by two-thirds vote of the Town Meeting, approving the Plan and a finding that the Plan, subject to such conditions or limitations as the Town Meeting may stipulate, provides benefits to the Town which outweigh any adverse effects for the Town or the vicinity, after consideration of the criteria specified in Section 7.4.3. 
Special Permits shall then be required, and shall be approved by the Board of Appeals only upon determination by that Board that the proposal is consistent with the approved Concept Plan, or in the event of an inconsistency, that the departure is necessitated by changed conditions or earlier error, and that the inconsistency does not result in less beneficial development, based on the considerations of Section 7.4.3, Special Permit Criteria. 
3.5.3 Procedures 
a) 	Submittal.  Five copies of the Concept Plan shall be filed with the Planning Board at least 60 days prior to the date of Town Meeting vote. 
b) 	Concept Plan Contents. A Concept Plan shall consist of the following: 
1) 	A schematic development plan, indicating boundaries of the lot, buildings, roads, drives, parking, reserved open space, existing topography and proposed grading, areas of retained vegetation and proposed planting areas, and a locus plan showing relation to nearby streets, zoning district boundaries, and water bodies. 
2) 	Floor plans and elevations of all existing and proposed structures. 
3) 	Materials indicating the proposed ultimate floor area in each use; time schedule for development; service improvements proposed at the developers and those anticipated at the Towns expense. 
4) 	An estimate of peak hour vehicle trips onto and off of the site. 
5) 	Analysis indicating degree of consistency with each of the considerations of Section 7.4.3, Special Permit Criteria. 
c) Study Model.  Applicants are encouraged to provide a study model of the proposal for display prior to and at hearings and the Town Meeting. 
3.5.4 Pre-Town Meeting Hearing 
Prior to Town Meeting action, the Planning Board shall hold a public hearing on the Concept Plan with timing, notice and procedures the same as those required for a hearing on a Special Permit.  In addition, the applicant shall be required to post conspicuous notice on the premises indicating the nature of the proposal and time and place of the hearing. The Planning Board shall report its recommendation to the Town Meeting, with a copy of the Concept Plan and the recommendation to be filed with the Town Clerk not less than 14 days prior to the Town Meeting vote on the Concept Plan. 
3.5.5 Special Permit 
Application for an initial Special Permit must be made not more than 12 months after the Town Meeting approval of the Concept Plan.

5.1.1 Number of Spaces 
a) 	Off-street parking must be provided to service all increases in parking demand resulting from new construction, additions, or change of use to one requiring more parking, without counting any existing spaces needed to meet requirements for the existing building and use. The number of spaces indicated in Section 5.1.2, Schedule of Requirements, shall be the basis for determining adequacy of provisions. Any existing spaces removed shall be replaced in kind unless they are either in excess of the number required or removed at the request of the Town. Parking spaces also serving as loading areas shall not be credited. 
b) 	The number of spaces may be reduced to less than that stipulated below if, in acting on Design and Site Plan Review, the Planning Board determines that a smaller number would be adequate for all parking needs because of such special circumstances as: 
1. 	
shared parking for uses having peak parking demands at different times, 

2. 	
unusual age or other characteristics of site users, or 

3. 	
user sponsored demand reduction devices such as carpooling. 


c) 	In the Local Business III Districts, legal on-street parking may be credited towards meeting these requirements if located between the premises side lot lines on the same side of the street. 
5.1.2 Schedule of Requirements 
a) 	Dwellings:  two parking spaces for each dwelling unit therein, except one parking space for each dwelling unit having fewer than two bedrooms.

Proposed amendments to approvals under this Section shall follow the procedures set forth for initial applications.  
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 6G to the contrary, Design and Site Plan Review shall not be required for alterations or repairs to an existing building in a previously approved SPSOD development project that do not increase the height, bulk, or footprint thereof, that are not being performed to provide for its use for a substantially different purpose, and that do not violate the conditions contained within any prior Design and Site Plan Approval applicable to such building. 
6G.5.2 	Special Permit Application 
All applications for Special Permits in the SPSOD shall follow the sections of the Town of Belmont Zoning By-Law that are applicable to the application procedures. 
6G.5.3 	Additional Special Permit Conditions for Age-Restricted Housing Developments and Assisted Living Facilities 
In granting a Special Permit under this Section, the Planning Board may impose such other conditions, safeguards, and limitations on time or use that it determines to be in compliance with the applicable criteria set forth in this Section including, but not limited to the following conditions: 
a) Deed Restrictions 
All dwellings in the development shall be subject to an age restriction described in a deed/deed rider, restrictive covenant, the deed of the trust, master deed or articles of incorporation, or other document approved by the Planning Board that shall be recorded in the chain of title with the Registry of Deeds or Land Court.  The age restriction shall limit the dwelling units to occupancy by seniors, age 55 or older; or their spouses of any age; provide for reasonable time-limit guest visitation rights; and may authorize special exceptions that allow persons of all ages to live in the dwelling unit together with a senior resident, if the Planning Board so approves and specifies in its Special Permit. Except in the event of the death of the qualifying occupant of a dwelling unit, or foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of a dwelling unit, a two-year exemption shall be allowed to facilitate the transfer of dwelling units to another eligible household. Deed restrictions, including age restrictions, shall run with the land in perpetuity and shall be enforceable by an association of owners or any owner(s) of dwelling units in the Development and by the Town of Belmont.  
Furthermore, the continuing observance and enforcement of the age restriction described herein shall be a condition of compliance with the SPSOD. Exceptions to this requirement shall be allowed only in the case where eligible residents are deceased, and there is no surviving eligible residents, and the units are owned and occupied by the deceased eligible residents surviving spouse. 
b) Local Preference 
The Planning Board shall require that Belmont residents be given preference in the purchase or rental of dwelling units within the SPSOD. Such preference shall be for thirty percent of the dwelling units in the development and shall be for at least one year from the issuance of the first Certificate of Occupancy for any residential building or portion thereof. 
6G.5.4 	Coordination with Other Provisions of By-Law

 	
Appeals -To hear and decide an appeal taken by any person aggrieved by reason of his (her) inability to obtain a permit or enforcement action from the Building Inspector under the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40A and/or this By-Law, by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council or by any person including an officer or board of the Town of Belmont or of an abutting town aggrieved by an order or decision of the Building Inspector in violation of any provision of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40A or of this By-Law. 

 	
Special Permits -To hear and decide on application for Special Permits as provided in this By-Law in cases where the Board of Appeals is designated as Special Permit Granting Authority.

8.6.1 Design and Site Plan Review 
The Planning Board shall promulgate rules and regulations requiring an applicant for Design and Site Plan Review under this Section to pay a review fee in an amount to be determined by the Planning Board to cover the reasonable costs of the Planning Board for the employment of any independent consultants determined to be needed to assist in the review of the application for Design and Site Plan Review.  Such consultants shall be qualified professionals in the relevant fields of expertise as determined by the Planning Board. 
Review of a submitted application shall follow the procedures below and as specified in Section 7.3.3 of the Zoning By-Laws. Where there is a conflict in procedures, those specified below shall prevail.  The Planning Board, or its designee, shall review a submitted application for completeness and shall notify the Applicant within thirty (30) days of its submission whether the application is complete or, if not, what items are missing.  If the Planning Board fails to so notify the Applicant within such time, the application shall be deemed complete; provided that nothing herein shall be interpreted to limit the ability of the Planning Board to require additional information.  The time for holding a public hearing shall not commence until the Planning Board has received a complete application. 
An application for Design and Site Plan Review hereunder shall be approved if such application, as affected by such reasonable conditions as the Planning Board may impose, is consistent with the objectives in this Section and all other requirements of this By-Law.  The Planning Board may impose such reasonable conditions on its approval as it shall deem appropriate to assure the continuing consistency of the development project with the purposes of Section 8. 
An application may be denied where: 
a) 	An application is incomplete; or 
b) 	No reasonable conditions will ensure that the proposed development is consistent with the standards and criteria set forth in Section 8.3.  Such a denial shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for denial. 
Any proposed amendment to an Approval under this Section shall follow the procedures set forth herein for an initial application. 
Notwithstanding any provisions hereof to the contrary, Design and Site Plan Review shall not be required for alterations or repairs to an existing building in a previously approved CSOD development project which do not increase the height, bulk, or footprint thereof, which are not being performed to provide for its use for a substantially different purpose and which do not violate the conditions contained within any prior Design and Site Plan Approval applicable to such building.
