Prior to allowing such a reduction in lot coverage, the Code Enforcement Officer shall make a finding that:

a)	Strict conformity with the lot coverage standards will result in a deck or accessory structure that is so small or irregular in shape that it would be substantially unusable or impractical; and

b)	His/her determination that compliance would result in a deck or accessory structure substantially unusable or impractical is based upon the average person standard and not the personal taste or desires of the applicant.

Prior to allowing such a reduction in required setbacks, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall make a finding that the reduction will not result in any two structures, principal or accessory, on opposite sides of the side lot line or rear lot line being closer to each other than the setback for a single structure established in Section IV.D of this Ordinance.

3.	CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

The Code Enforcement Officer and the Board of Appeals may in approving requests for a reduction in lot coverage or setbacks, attach such reasonable and appropriate terms and conditions, in addition to those required elsewhere in this Ordinance, that they find necessary to further the purposes of this Ordinance.

The term “undue hardship” shall mean all of the following:

a)	The land in question can not yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;

b)	That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;

c)	That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and

d)	That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.

4.	The Board may grant a variance to a property owner for the purpose of making that property accessible to a person with a disability who is living on the property.  The Board shall  restrict any variance granted under this sub-section solely to the installation of equipment  or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the property by the person with the disability.  The Board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives on the property.  For the purposes of this sub-section, a disability has the same meaning as a physical or mental handicap under Title 5, Section 4553.





5.	The Board shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to insure conformance with the purposes and provisions of this Ordinance to the greatest extent possible, and in doing so may impose such conditions to a variance as it   deems necessary.  The party receiving the variance shall comply with any conditions imposed.

SECTION VIII: PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURES/SKETCH PLAN REVIEW


SECTION USER'S GUIDE:  This section contains provisions related to the procedures to be followed and submissions required during the Pre-Application/Sketch  Plan Review stage of the subdivision review process provided by this Ordinance.



A.	GENERAL

All applicants shall meet with the Planning Board and otherwise comply with the pre-application procedures set forth below prior to the formal submission of a subdivision plan. All subdivision applications submitted to the Holden Planning Board shall be conservation subdivisions. See explanation in paragraph C, below, Section XVl.E., Retention of Open Spaces and Natural or Historic Features, and Section XX, Requirements for Conservation Subdivisions.

B.	PURPOSE OF PRE-APPLICATION  PROCESS

The purpose of the pre-application process is for the applicant to present general information regarding the proposed subdivision to the Code Enforcement Officer/Planner (CEO/Planner) and Planning Board and receive the CEO/Planner's and Planning Board's comments prior to the expenditure of substantial sums of money on surveying, engineering, and the preparation of a subdivision application by the applicant.

C.	EXPLANATION OF CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION

A conservation subdivision is a technique that concentrates development in one or more compact areas on the site in exchange for conserving open space and natural areas elsewhere on the site. The minimum lot sizes, setbacks and frontage requirements for the zone are relaxed in order to create open space on the site. The municipal ordinance typically permits the same amount of development that is already permitted. The key difference is that this technique requires new construction to be located on only a portion - typically half - of the parcel. This new construction should incorporate buffers, landscaping and design features to preserve the rural character of the zone in which it is located. The remaining open space is permanently protected under a conservation easement held by a land trust, the municipality itself, or under such terms as the parties may agree.

 
 

Traditional subdivision - development of entire parcel with lots
 

Conservation subdivision - development of portion of site with same # of lots

D.	PRE-APPLICATION   PROCEDURE

The pre-application phase consists of the following three activities:

1.	The submission to and review by the Planning Board of a Site Inventory and Analysis (see paragraph E, below)

2.	Planning Board site inspection (see paragraph F, below)

3.    A pre-application conference (see paragraph G, below)

E.	SUBMISSION OF SITE INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS

All applicants for subdivision approval shall submit a Site Inventory and Analysis to the Code Enforcement Officer/Planner. This requirement shall apply to new subdivisions, amendments to existing subdivision and re-subdivision of land within an existing subdivision. Submission of the site inventory and analysis shall not cause the plan to be a pending application or proceeding under Title 1 M.R.S.A. §302.

1.	PURPOSE

The Site Inventory and Analysis is intended to provide the applicant, the Planning Board, and the CEO/Planner with a better understanding of the site and the opportunities and constraints imposed on its use by both the natural and built environments, and to provide a complete and factual reference for the Planning Board in making its site inspection. It is anticipated that this analysis will result in a subdivision plan that reflects the conditions of the site; those areas most suitable for conservation and open space will be preserved to the maximum extent possible, and those areas most suitable for the proposed use will be utilized. Therefore, the submission requirements provide that the applicant submit basic information about the site. The Planning Board's focus during this phase will be primarily on the location of open space.

2.	SUBMISSION  REQUIREMENTS

The Site Inventory and Analysis shall include the following information:

a.	The name of the property owner and the name of the applicant, if different.

b.	Evidence that the applicant has right, title or interest in the property.

c.	An aerial photograph enlarged to a scale not less detailed than I inch = 400 feet, to show the relationship of the proposed area to be subdivided to adjacent properties and to the total areas owned in whole or in part by the applicant. The aerial photograph shall include:

1)	Property boundaries in the area;
2)	Locations and names of existing streets;
3)	Boundaries and designations of zoning districts;
4)	Wetlands, regardless of size, prepared by a State Certified Soil Scientist or Geologist registered in the State of Maine, based on an on-site investigation, streams or ponds located in whole or in part on the parcel proposed to be subdivided.
5)	The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain;
6)	Public land, and
7)	Land protected under conservation easements.

d.	One or more maps of the site at the same scale as the aerial photograph showing:

1)	Topographic, physical and cultural features including fields, pastures, meadows, wooded areas, trees with a diameter of 15 inches or more, steep slopes over 20%, rock outcrops, soil types, ponds, ditches, drains, streams
 

2)	Cultural features such as all structures, foundations, walls, wells, trails and abandoned roads

e.	Names and addresses of abutters.

3.	REVIEW OF SITE INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS  BY CEO/PLANNER

Upon receipt of a Site Inventory and Analysis, the Code Enforcement Officer/Planner (CEO/Planner) shall give the applicant a dated receipt. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a site inventory and analysis submission, the CEO/Planner shall review the material and determine whether the submission is complete. If the submission is determined to be complete, the
applicant shall provide ten (10) copies of the Site Inventory and Analysis to the Code Enforcement Officer. Following receipt of the 10 copies, the Code Enforcement Officer/Planner shall place the item on the agenda for review by the Planning Board at the next available meeting.

If the submission is determined to be incomplete, the CEO/Planner shall notify the applicant in writing of this finding and shall specify the additional material required to make the submission complete. The CEO/Planner shall advise the applicant that, unless the applicant applies for a waiver or reduction of the submission requirements, the application will not be considered by the Board until the additional information is submitted. These steps shall be repeated until the application is found to be complete. When the submission is determined to be complete, or when the applicant has submitted a written, signed request for a waiver or reduction of submission requirements, the Code Enforcement Officer/Planner shall place the item on the agenda for review by the Planning Board at the next available meeting. The Planning Board shall have the final say on the completeness of the Site Inventory and Analysis and/or whether or not to grant a waiver or reduction of requirements.

4.	WAIVER OR REDUCTION OF SITE INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Upon written appeal by the applicant, the Planning Board may waive the submission requirements set forth in E.2., above, or reduce the amount of information required for the
revision of previously approved plans, upon a finding that the analysis provided by this process is not necessary due to the scale of the project and the absence of any significant natural resources or development constraints on the site. Requests for waivers from a submission requirement
must be submitted in writing by the applicant. Unless waived by the Board, this review must be completed prior to the preparation and submission of a subdivision application and supporting documentation.

5.	REVIEW OF SITE INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS  BY PLANNING BOARD

Unless the requirements for a Site Inventory and Analysis are waived or reduced, the Planning Board shall review the Site Inventory and Analysis with the applicant to determine if the information provides a clear understanding of the site and identifies opportunities and constraints that will help determine how it should be used, areas that are appropriate for conservation areas, and areas that are appropriate for development.

F.  SITE INSPECTION

The Planning Board may conduct an on-site inspection of the site, and may invite members of the Conservation Commission and/or abutters to be present during the inspection. Applicants, their site designers, and the landowner(s) are encouraged to accompany the Planning Board. The purpose of the visit is to familiarize local officials with the property's existing conditions and special features, to identify potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to discuss the general layout of land to be preserved as open space (if applicable). Comments made by the Planning Board, the CEO/Planner, and other local officials shall be interpreted as being only suggestions. It shall be understood by all parties that no formal recommendations can be offered, and no official decisions
 

can be made, at the site inspection. The site inspection shall not cause the plan to be a pending application or proceeding under Title 1 M.R.S.A. §302.

If a review is pending during a period when there is snow cover, the deadline by which the Planning Board shall take final action on the site inventory and analysis may be extended, which extension shall not exceed thirty (30) days after the Board is able to conduct an on-site inspection.

Review of the Site Inventory and Analysis shall be considered complete upon a finding by the Planning Board that the appropriate areas have been determined for conservation or open space.

G.	PRE-APPLICATION  CONFERENCE

B.	RELATIONSHIP TO MUNICIPAL SERVICES

The proposed development shall not have an unreasonable adverse impact on the municipal services including municipal road systems, fire department, police department, sewer and water systems, solid waste program, schools, open spaces, recreational programs and facilities, and other municipal services and facilities.

C.	PRESERVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE LANDSCAPE

The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as reasonably practicable by minimizing tree removal, disturbance of soil, and retaining existing vegetation during construction.  After construction is completed, landscaping shall be planted that will define, soften or screen the appearance of off-street parking areas, buildings and other structures from the public right-of-way and abutting properties in order to enhance the physical design of the proposed development, and to minimize the encroachment of the proposed uses on neighboring land uses.

D.	RELATIONSHIP TO SCENIC CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

Proposed buildings, structures and roads shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings and structures in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed subdivision, so they will not have an unreasonable adverse effect on the scenic character of the surrounding area, or on scenic resources identified in the 2007 Comprehensive  Plan.

E.	RETENTION OF OPEN SPACES AND NATURAL OR HISTORIC FEATURES

All subdivisions in the Town of Holden shall be Conservation Subdivisions as described in Section
VIII.	See also Section XX: Requirements for Conservation Subdivisions

1.	Rural Area Requirement: In rural areas including portions of the R1 Zone as described in the Comprehensive Plan, and all areas within R2 and R3 Zones, at least 50% of the land suitable for development in proposed subdivisions shall be preserved as open space.

2.	Growth Area Requirement: In growth areas as described in the Comprehensive Plan, the applicant shall provide at least ten (10) percent of his total area as usable open space.  In any subdivision twenty (20) acres or less, or containing ten (10) lots or dwelling units or less, the Board may grant a waiver for all or a portion of this requirement.  It is desirable that areas reserved for recreation be at least two (2) acres in size and easily accessible from all lots within the subdivision.

3.	Land reserved for open space purposes shall be of a character, configuration, and location suitable for the particular use intended.  For example a site intended to be used for active recreation purposes, such as a playground or a play field, should be relatively level and dry, have a total frontage on one or more roads of at least two hundred (200) feet, and have no major dimensions of less than two hundred (200) feet.  Sites selected primarily for scenic or passive recreation purposes shall have such access as the Board may deem suitable and no less than
 

twenty-five (25) feet of road frontage.  The configuration of such sites shall be deemed adequate by the Board with regard to scenic attributes to be preserved, together with sufficient areas for trails, lookouts, etc. where necessary and appropriate.

4.	Where the proposed subdivision is located on a lake, pond, river or stream, a portion of the waterfront area, shall be included in the reserved land.  The land so reserved shall be at least 200 feet wide measured perpendicularly from the normal high water mark.

5.	If the Planning Board determines that the reservation of land for open space purposes would be inappropriate or that the land is not suitable or is insufficient in amount, the Board may waive the requirement of open space on the condition that the Applicant offer suitable land, as determined by the Planning Board, in another location or deposit a cash payment in lieu of land reservation in an amount determined by the Planning Board, with the Town Clerk.  Such a payment shall be placed in a trust fund to be used exclusively for the purchase and development of neighborhood sites for open space purposes.  In growth areas, the amount of such payment shall be not more than 25% of the estimated market value, including the value attributable to the proposed subdivision improvements (such as roads, drainage facilities, utility services as defined in 33
M.R.S. § 458, etc.), for each lot approved on the final plan. In rural areas, the amount of such payment shall not be more than 75% of the estimated market value, including improvements (such as roads, drainage facilities, utility services as defined in 33 M.R.S. §458, etc.), for each lot approved on the final plan. The estimated market values shall be determined by the Town Tax Assessor.  If the Applicant disagrees with the Assessor's determinations of value, the Applicant may submit an appraisal prepared by a duly certified appraiser under Maine law for the Board's consideration.

6.	The Board may require that the development plans include a landscape plan that will show the preservation whenever  practicable of any existing trees larger than twenty-four (24) inches diameter 4 feet from the ground, the replacement of trees and vegetation, graded contours, streams and the preservation of scenic, historic or environmentally significant areas.  Cutting of trees on the northerly borders of lots should be avoided as far as possible, to retain a natural wind buffer.

A.	GENERAL  REQUIREMENTS

In approving applications submitted pursuant to this Ordinance, the following requirements shall apply:

1.	The proposed development shall provide for safe access to and from public and private roads.
Safe access shall be assured by providing an adequate number and location of access points with respect to sight distances, intersections, schools and other traffic generators.

2.	Curb cuts shall be limited to the absolute minimum number and widths necessary for safe entering and exiting.  The proposed development shall not have an unreasonable adverse impact on the town road system and shall assure safe interior circulation within its site by separating pedestrian and vehicular traffic and providing adequate parking and loading areas.

3.	Provisions shall be made for providing and maintaining convenient and safe emergency vehicle access to all buildings and structures at all times.

4.	The Board shall not approve any development plan unless proposed roads are designed in accordance with the specifications contained in this Ordinance. Pavement, but not base standards, may be waived in the Rural Resource/Residential (R-3) and Shoreland Residential (R-4) Zones, provided that the developer enters into a legally binding arrangement preventing such gravel road from becoming the responsibility of the Town without three affirmative votes of the Town Council and prior paving to Town standards.  Approval of a Final Plan by the Board, shall not be deemed to constitute or be evidence of acceptance by the Town of any road or easement.

5.	On any public road within one-half mile of an access to the Route 1-395 Connector, the development shall be designed to comply with the access management standards promulgated by the Maine Department of Transportation  (www.maine.gov/mdot,  look under transportation planning, planning-process-programs).  If the public road is not an arterial as defined in the rules, it shall be regarded as an arterial for the purposes of complying with this requirement.

B.	ROAD DESIGN STANDARDS

1.	These design standards shall be met by all roads within subdivisions reviewed under this Ordinance, and shall control the roadway, shoulders, curbs, sidewalks, drainage systems, culverts, and other appurtenances.

3.	Where a development borders an existing narrow road (not meeting the width requirements of the standards for roads in this Ordinance), or when the Comprehensive Plan indicates plans for realignment or widening of a road that would require use of some of the land in the development, the Planning Board may require that the development plan indicate reserved areas for widening
or realigning the road marked "Reserved for Road Realignment (Widening) Purposes." Land reserved for such purposes may not be included in computing lot area or setback requirements of this Ordinance. When such widening or realignment is indicated on the Official Map, the reserve area shall not be included in any lot, but shall be reserved to be deeded to the Town or State.

4.	Where a Major subdivision abuts or contains an existing and a proposed Town Way, no residential lot may have vehicular access directly on to the existing Town Way. This requirement shall be noted on the Plan and in the deeds of any lot with frontage on the Town Way.
 

5.	Any development containing ten (10) or more dwelling units or lots shall have at least two (2) road connections with existing public roads, roads shown on an Official Map, or roads on an approved development plan for which performance guarantees have been filed and accepted.

2.	Buffers shall be considered in or for the following areas and purposes:

a.	Along property lines, to shield various uses from each other;

b.	Along interior roads running parallel to roads exterior to the site, to prevent confusion, particularly at night;

c.	Parking areas, garbage collection areas, and loading and unloading areas; and

d.	To block prevailing wind patterns and to stop wind-borne debris from leaving the site.

3.	Buffers shall be sufficient to shield structures and uses from the view of incompatible abutting properties and public road ways, and to otherwise prevent any nuisances.

4.	Exposed storage areas, service areas, exposed machinery installation, sand and gravel extraction operations, truck-loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and areas used for the storage or collection of discarded automobiles, auto parts, metals or any other articles of salvage or refuse, and similar accessory areas and structures, shall have sufficient setbacks and screening to provide an audio/visual buffer sufficient to minimize their adverse impact on other land uses within the development site and surrounding properties, such as a stockade fence or a dense evergreen hedge six (6) feet or more in height.

5.	Where a potential safety hazard to children would be likely to arise, physical screening sufficient to deter small children from entering the premises shall be provided and shall be maintained in good condition.

6.	Natural features shall be maintained wherever possible to provide a buffer between the proposed development and incompatible abutting properties and public roadways.  When natural features such as topography, gullies, stands of trees, shrubbery, or rock outcrops do not exist or are insufficient to provide a buffer, other kinds of buffers shall be considered.

7.	Evergreens can be used as buffers, provided they are planted in two (2) or three (3) rows of staggered plantings.  The rows should be seven (7) feet apart and the evergreens planted six (6) feet on center.

8.	Fencing and screening shall be durable and properly maintained at all times by the owner.

Prior to issuance of any permit, the applicant shall furnish to the Town of Holden a bond, letter of credit, or other form of security approved by the Board, equal to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the value of all plantings required under this subsection.  The bond shall be binding for a minimum of three (3) years and shall be subject to the condition that required plantings be maintained in accordance with the terms of the Board's approval and in a good and healthy condition. Notwithstanding the requirement of a bond from the applicant, the owner of any premises approved
 
SECTION XVIII:   BUFFER AND SCREENING STANDARDS (continued)

by the Board under any section of this Ordinance shall have a continuing obligation to maintain required plantings in accordance with the terms of the Board's approval and in a good and healthy condition.
 
SECTION XIX: STORM DRAINAGE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS


SECTION   USER'S  GUIDE:	This  section  contains  specific   standards   relating  to  the  design  and construction of storm water management systems.



A.	GENERAL  PROVISIONS

In approving applications submitted pursuant to this Ordinance, the Board shall require the applicant to meet the following storm drainage design and construction standards:

1.	The storm drainage system will not adversely affect neighboring properties, downstream water quality, or cause soil erosion.  Whenever possible, on-site absorption and/or evaporation of
run-off waters shall be utilized to minimize discharges from the site.

2.	Surface water runoff shall be minimized and detained on-site if possible or practicable.   If it is not practicable to detain water on site, downstream improvements to the channel may be required of the developer to prevent flooding caused by his project.  The natural state of watercourses, swales, floodway or rights-of-way shall be maintained as nearly as possible.  The design basis is a twenty-five (25) year storm.

B.	STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN STANDARDS

1.	Adequate provision shall be made for disposal of all storm water generated within the development and any drained ground water through a management system of swales, culverts, under drain, and water courses.  The storm water management system shall be designed to conduct storm water flows to existing watercourses.

2.	All components of the storm water management system shall be designed to meet the criteria of a twenty-five (25) year storm based on rainfall data for the closest reporting station to Holden, Maine.

3.	The minimum pipe size for any storm drainage pipe shall be fifteen (15) inches in diameter.  The minimum and maximum lengths, shall be based upon common engineering practices that take into account frost protection and future maintenance.   Maximum trench width at the pipe crown shall be the outside diameter of the pipe plus two (2) feet.  Pipe shall be bedded in a fine granular material, containing no stones larger than three (3) inches, lumps of clay, or organic matter, reaching a minimum of six (6) inches below the bottom of the pipe extending to six (6) inches above the top of the pipe.

4.	Catch basins shall be installed where necessary and located at the curb line.

5.	Inlets and outlets shall be stabilized against soil erosion by stone rip-rap or other suitable materials to reduce storm water velocity.

6.	The storm water management system shall be designed to accommodate complete watershed drainage, taking into account existing conditions and approved or planned developments not yet built and shall include a surplus design capacity factor of twenty-five (25) percent for potential increases in upstream runoff.

7.	Downstream drainage requirements shall be studied to determine the effect of the proposed development.  The storm drainage shall not overload existing or future planned storm drainage systems downstream from the development.  The developer shall be responsible for financing any improvements to existing drainage systems required to handle the increased storm flows.

8.	Where soils require a subsurface drainage system, the drains shall be installed and maintained separately from the storm water drainage system.

SECTION XX: REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS

SECTION USER'S GUIDE:  This section sets forth the minimum requirements for conservation subdivisions.  All subdivisions applications submitted to the Town of Holden Planning Board shall be conservation subdivisions.


A.	POLICY

It is the policy of the Town of Holden to require the use of conservation subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space, provide for sustainable agriculture and forestry as well as recreational land, preserve other resources identified in the Town of Holden Comprehensive  Plan, and harmonize new development with the traditional open, wooded, agricultural, rural and village landscapes of the Town.

This performance standard is intended to implement that policy by providing incentives that afford flexibility to landowners in road and lot layout and design and road frontage requirements and by allowing the Planning Board to expedite procedure and to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and provisions of this Subdivision Ordinance.  These incentives are designed to encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing and environmental design for the development of single and multi-family residential areas that will promote the most appropriate use of land and will preserve, as permanent open space, agricultural or forestry land, important natural features, wildlife habitat, water resources, ecological systems, and historic and scenic areas for the benefit of present and future residents.

B.	PURPOSES

To qualify for approval as a conservation subdivision, the Planning Board must find that the proposed conservation subdivision will achieve the following purposes that are applicable to its specific circumstances:

1.	Long term protection and conservation of existing natural and other resources and landscapes identified in the Comprehensive Plan including but not limited to:

a.	State-defined critical areas, and unique natural features located on the parcel to be subdivided;

b.	Historic land use patterns and historic structures;

c.	Points of visual access to or from water bodies, scenic vistas, and points of access to water bodies;

d.	Contiguous stands of mature trees; or

e.	Other significant open space areas.

2.	Maintenance or establishment of compatibility with surrounding land uses and the overall rural character of the Town as envisioned by the Comprehensive Plan;

3.	Provision of adequate buffers for adjoining properties where needed;

4.	Contribution to Town-wide open space planning by creating a system of permanently preserved open space, both within large parcels of land and among such parcels throughout the Town, and by encouraging linkages between open space areas;

5.	Conservation of land suitable or actively used for agriculture and forestry uses, particularly where the conservation subdivision borders active agricultural or forestry land or land suitable for the same;

6.	Conservation of traditional land uses;
 

7.	Creation of choices in the type of environment (business or residential) and type of housing available that will be a long-term asset to the Town of Holden;

8.	Construction of affordable housing;

9.	Provision of recreation facilities, including active and passive recreational space, in the most suitable locations for use consistent with the other purposes of this performance standard;

10.	Attainment of planned variety and coordination in the location of structures, and building forms and relationships; and

11.	Avoidance of strip development along the Town's road networks.

C.	GROUPING  CONTIGUOUS  PARCELS

In order to increase design flexibility, two or more contiguous parcels of land under the same or different ownership, including parcels separated by a public or private road, may be grouped together as one conservation subdivision, if the Planning Board finds that such grouping will benefit the Town and that it helps achieve the purposes set forth in Paragraph B.

D.	MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LOTS ALLOWED (see also Section XX., paragraph F) The maximum number of lots allowed shall be calculated in the following manner:
1.	Determine the land suitable for development of the parcel according to Section XVI, General Performance Standards, Subsection F, "Land Not Suitable for Development," of the Town of Holden Subdivision Ordinance; then

2.	Divide the land suitable for development by the minimum lot size required in the Zoning Ordinance to obtain the maximum number of lots allowed; then

3.	Subtract the land area that would be needed for internal roads if it were not a Conservation Subdivision and recalculate the maximum allowable number of lots by:

a.	Multiplying the required frontage in the zone by the gross number of lots determined in #2 above, divide by two (this method assumes a double-loaded street) and multiply by the 50- foot right of way. For example:

If the required frontage is 300 feet and the gross number of lots is 1O:

300 x 10 = 3,000 (multiply the required frontage by the gross number of lots) 3,000/2 = 1,500 (divide the result, 3,000, by 2 to account for double-frontage lots)
1,500 x 50 = 75,000 square feet (multiply the result, 1,500, by the frontage to get 75,000)

b.	Subtract the resulting square footage obtained in 3.a., above, from the land suitable for development; and

c.	Divide the revised land suitable for development figure by the lot size requirement in the zone to obtain the maximum number of lots allowable.

4.	DENSITY BONUS: When the Planning Board determines that a density bonus is warranted, multiply the result obtained in 3.c by:

1.15 if the proposed development will provide for one of the following (4.a. or 4. b., below), or
1.20 if the proposed development will provide for both of the following (4.a. and 4.b., below), and round to the nearest whole number. A density bonus may be allowed by the Planning Board for:
 

a.	Affordable housing acceptable to the Town that meets the standards for affordable housing contained in the current affordability index for the Town of Holden prepared by the Maine State Housing Authority, when at least 10% of the housing units in the proposed subdivision or provided by the subdivider elsewhere in town will be affordable and mechanisms acceptable to the town are proposed to ensure that such units remain affordable; and/or

b.	Public access to usable open space provided by the developer acceptable to the Town such as, but not limited to, public access to trails, recreation areas or water bodies; or dedication of land to the Town of Holden to meet a public purpose. This provision shall not be met by offerings or dedication of land for roads, utilities and similar facilities serving the development.

5.	A lot for a dwelling unit created as part of a conservation subdivision shall not be further subdivided.

6.	A lot or parcel of land created as part of a conservation subdivision that has within its bounds designated open space shall not be further subdivided unless the original approved plan shall have reserved future development of such lot, but any such further subdivision shall only be  made in accordance with this performance standard.

E.	LAYOUT AND SITING STANDARDS

In planning the location and sitting of residential or business structures in a conservation subdivision, lot dimension and frontage should not be the primary considerations.   Priority should be given to the preservation of the open space for its natural resource value, with human habitation and business activity located and sited on the lower valued natural resource portion of a parcel, taking into account the contours of the land and the reasonableness of slopes.

The building lots on a parcel shall be laid out and the residence and business structures shall be sited so as to maximize the following principles.  The Board in its discretion shall resolve conflicts between these principles as applied to a particular site.

1.	On buildable land.

2.	In the least suitable agricultural soils and in a manner which maximizes the useable area remaining for the designated open space use, where agricultural, forestry, or recreational, existing or future uses, are particularly sought to be preserved;

3.	In locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic, historic, and traditional land use views, as seen from public roadways and great ponds;

4.	Within woodlands, or along the far edges of open agricultural fields adjacent to any woodland to reduce encroachment upon agricultural soils, to provide shade in the summer, and shelter as well as solar gain in the winter, and to enable new residential development to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features;

5.	In such manner that the boundaries between residential or business lots and active agricultural or forestry land are well buffered by vegetation, topography, roads, or other barriers to minimize potential conflict between residential or business and agricultural or forestry uses;

6.	In locations where buildings may be oriented with respect to scenic vistas, natural landscape features, topography, and natural drainage areas, in accordance with an overall plan for site development;

7.	In locations that provide compatibility in terms of physical size, visual impact, intensity of use, proximity to other structures, and density of development with other permitted uses within the land use district;
 
8.	In locations such that diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building, street, parking layout are encouraged; and

9.	So that individual lots, buildings, street and parking areas shall be designed and situated to minimize alterations of the natural site, to avoid the adverse effects of shadows, noise and traffic on the residents of the site, to conserve energy and natural resources, and to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and of buildings.

F.	SPACE STANDARDS (see also Section XX., paragraph D)

1.	Shore frontage and shore setback requirements shall not be reduced below the minimum shore frontage or shore setback required in the land use district.

2.	In R-2 and R-3 districts outside of the shoreland zone, the required minimum lot size or minimum land area per dwelling unit for the building envelope may be reduced in conservation subdivisions to no less than one-half acre.  In all districts outside the shoreland zone, if the lot area is reduced, the total open space in the development shall equal or exceed the sum of the areas by which the building lots are reduced below the minimum lot area normally required in the Zoning Ordinance as modified, if any, by paragraph D, above. If individual lot sizes are reduced, in no case shall the total number of lots exceed the maximum number of lots allowed in paragraph D, above.

3.	Minimum road frontage requirements of the Zoning Ordinance may be waived or modified by the Planning Board provided that:

a.	Any applicable provisions regarding roads in the Subdivision Ordinance are satisfied.

b.	Adequate access and turnaround to and from all parcels by fire trucks, ambulances, police cars and other emergency vehicles can be ensured by private roads and /or common driveways.

4.	A reduction of required setback distances other than required shoreland zoning setbacks may be allowed at the discretion of the Board to achieve the purposes of this Section.

5.	The designated open space shall include at least 50% of the land suitable for development in rural areas as described in the Comprehensive Plan, and 10% in growth areas as described in
the Comprehensive Plan. Any land not suitable for development that is designated as open space shall not be counted toward this 50% or 10% requirement.

6.	The setbacks of all structures shall be shown on the subdivision plan.

G.	UTILITIES

At the discretion of the Planning Board, in order to achieve the most appropriate design and layout of lots and open space, utilities, including individual wells and septic systems, may be located on designated portions of the open space, if necessary, provided the same shall not unreasonably interfere with the open space purposes to be achieved under this performance standard and for the particular parcel(s) that is the subject of the application for conservation subdivision approval.

1.	The Planning Board may waive or modify the requirement for hydrogeological reviews or studies, if the applicant demonstrates that due to the specific placement of wells and septic systems:

a.	Adequate groundwater is available at all locations proposed for individual water systems; and that

b.	There is no reasonable likelihood that the domestic water supply for any proposed lot will exceed 1Omg/I of nitrates.
 

The Planning Board may also waive or modify the requirement for hydrogeological reviews or studies if the development will be served by a public water system or a centralized water system.

2.	If a private collection septic system is proposed for a single family or multi-family conservation subdivision, the applicant must show either that at least one (1) designated site for each lot, in the open space or on the lot, has adequate soils and land area suitable for subsurface waste disposal for each lot in accordance with the minimum standards set forth in the Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules, and that a second designated site on the parcel has the size,
location and soil characteristics, to accommodate a system similar to the one originally proposed.

3.	If a private central collection system is proposed, the system shall be maintained by a homeowners association or under an agreement of the lot or unit owners in the same fashion required for maintenance of the open space by a homeowners association or the lot or unit owners in common and written evidence of said maintenance agreement shall be submitted to the Planning Board.

H.	OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS

In the review and approval of a conservation subdivision, the following requirements shall apply and shall supersede any inconsistent or more restrictive provisions of this Subdivision Ordinance or the Zoning Ordinance.

Open space set aside in a conservation subdivision shall be permanently preserved as required by this performance standard, except as allowed under this provision for flexible open space and the substitution for and/or the addition to the same, or where open space is dedicated by a landowner under contract with the Town for a term of years as set forth below.  Land set aside as permanent open space may, but need not be, a separate tax parcel.  Such land may be included as a portion of one or more large parcels on which dwellings are permitted, provided that a conservation easement or a declaration of covenants and restrictions is placed on such land pursuant to paragraph H.3 and provided that the Planning Board approves such configuration of the open space.

1.	OPEN SPACE USES

On all parcels, open space uses shall be appropriate to the site.  Open space shall include natural features located on the parcel(s) such as, but not limited to, stream beds, significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, agricultural land, forested acreage, wildlife habitat, rock outcroppings and historic features and sites.  Open space shall be preserved and maintained subject to the following, as applicable:

a.	On parcels that contain significant portions of land suited to agricultural production, open space shall be conserved for agriculture or other consistent open space uses such as forestry, recreation (active or passive), and resource conservation.

b.

c.	Open space areas shall be contiguous, where possible, to allow linking of open space areas throughout the Town.

d.	If the open space is to be devoted, at least in part to a productive land use, such as agriculture or forestry, the developer shall submit to the Planning Board a plan of how such use is to be fostered in the future.  Such plan may include, for example, a long-term timber management plan.

e.	The Planning Board may limit the use of any open space at the time of final plan approval where the Board deems it necessary to protect adjacent properties or uses, or to protect
 

sensitive natural features or resources.  A proposed change in use of open space land, other than that specified at the time of plan approval, shall be reviewed by the Planning Board as an amendment to the approved plan.

f.	Further subdivision of open space or its use for other than agriculture, forestry, recreation or conservation, except for easements for underground utilities, shall be prohibited and shall be so stated as a condition of plat approval in the Planning Board order and by deed restrictions except as provided in paragraph H.3.  Structures and buildings accessory to agriculture, recreation or conservation uses may be erected on open space, subject to Planning Board approval of these provisions for conservation subdivisions.

2.	NOTATIONS ON PLAN

Open space must be clearly labeled on the Final Plan as to its use or uses with respect to the portions of the open space that such use or uses apply, ownership, management, method of preservation, and the rights, if any, of the owners in the subdivision to such land or portions thereof. The Plan shall clearly show that the open space land is permanently reserved for open space purposes, indicating the book and page of any conservation easements or deed restrictions required to be recorded to implement such reservations or restrictions.

3.	PRESERVATION  IN PERPETUITY

An owner of a parcel of land may designate all or a portion of the parcel for open space use in perpetuity if the purposes set forth in paragraph B are achieved and all other requirements of this performance standard are met subject to the following conditions:

a.	A draft perpetual conservation easement, or declaration of covenants and restrictions, restricting development of the open space land must be included in the conservation subdivision application.

b.	The conservation easement may be granted to or the declarations may be for the benefit of a private party, third party or other entity, the Town, with the approval of the Town Council, or to a qualified not-for-profit conservation organization acceptable to the Planning Board.

c.	Such conservation easement or declaration of covenants and restrictions shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board and be required as a condition of plan approval hereunder.

d.	The Planning Board may require that such conservation easement, or declaration of covenants and restrictions, be enforceable by the Town of Holden if the Town is not the holder of the conservation easement or beneficiary of the declarations.

e.	The conservation easement or declarations shall prohibit residential, industrial, or commercial use of such open space land (except in connection with agriculture, forestry, and recreation), and shall not be amendable to permit such use.

f.	The conservation easement or declarations shall be recorded in the Penobscot County Registry of Deeds prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the conservation subdivision final plan in the Penobscot County Registry of Deeds.

4.	OWNERSHIP OF OPEN SPACE LAND

Open space land may be held in private ownership including an appropriate third party not the applicant; or owned in common by a homeowner's association (HOA); dedicated to the Town, County or State governments or agencies; transferred to a non-profit organization such as a conservation trust acceptable to the Planning Board; or held in such other form of ownership as the Planning Board finds adequate to achieve the purposes set forth in paragraph B and under the other requirements of this Ordinance.
 

The appropriate form of ownership shall be determined based upon the purpose of the open space reservation as stated pursuant to section paragraph H.1 above. Unless so determined, or unless deeded to the Town of Holden and accepted by the citizens of the Town at Town Meeting, common open space shall be owned in common by the owners of the lots or units in the development. Covenants for mandatory membership in the association setting forth the owners' rights and interest and privileges in the association and the common land, shall be approved by the Planning Board and included in the deed for each lot.

A.	CONSTRUCTION OF LANGUAGE

In this Ordinance, certain terms and words shall be interpreted as follows:

1.	The words "persons" and "applicant" includes individuals, firms, associations, corporations, organizations, and similar entities;

2.	Words used or defined in one tense or form shall include other tenses or derivative forms;

3.	Words in the singular number shall include the plural number and words in the plural shall include the singular number;

4.	The masculine gender shall include the feminine and the feminine shall include the masculine;

5.	The word "shall" is mandatory;

6.	The word "may" is permissive;

7.	In case of difference of meaning or implication between the text of this Ordinance and any map, illustration, or table, the text shall control.

B.	DEFINITIONS

For the purpose of interpreting this Ordinance, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein.

1.	APPLICANT

The assessed owner or owners of land to be subdivided or person with documented right, title, or interest in the land to be subdivided.

2.	COMPLETE APPLICATION

4.	CONSERVATION  SUBDIVISION

A technique that concentrates development in one or more compact areas on the site in exchange for conserving open space and natural areas elsewhere on the site.

The municipal ordinance typically permits the same amount of development that is already permitted. The key difference is that this technique requires new construction to be located on only a portion - typically half - of the parcel. This new construction should incorporate buffers, landscaping and design features to preserve the rural character of the zone in which it is located. The remaining open space is permanently protected under a conservation easement  held by a land trust, the municipality itself, or under such terms as the parties may agree.

107	AMENDMENTS TO ORDINANCE AND OFFICIAL ZONING MAP

The process for amending the Ordinance and Official Zoning Map is as follows:

107.1	INITIATION

A proposal to amend this Ordinance or the Official Zoning Map may be initiated by:

107.1.1	The Planning Board, by majority vote;

107.1.2	The Town Council, through a request to the Planning Board; or

107.1.3	Any 5 qualified voters may begin initiative proceedings by a request in writing to the Town Clerk. The Clerk shall provide the appropriate petition blanks within 5 days of when they are requested.  The complete text of the proposed amendment shall be included in the request.  All papers of the petition shall be uniform in size and style and shall be assembled as one instrument for filing. They shall contain or have attached thereto throughout their circulation the full text of the proposed amendment. These 5 qualified voters shall be referred to as the Requesting
Committee during the initiative procedure. The Requesting Committee shall have 30 days from the acceptance date of the request by the Town Clerk to cause the petitions to be signed by 5% of the number of votes cast in the Town at the last gubernatorial election but not fewer than 70 voters.  Any voter of Holden may circulate the petition.  The petition shall be signed only once by qualified voters of the Town and each voter's signature shall be followed by his/her address. An affidavit-of-the-circulator,
 

similar to that which is required in MRSA Title 30-A, Section 2102(3) (b)(3), as amended, will be required.

Petitioners may present their petitions to the Clerk at any time during the circulation period within 7 days after the   petition circulation period ends, the clerk shall certify to the Town Council and notify the Requesting Committee that the petition has been signed by 5% of the total of qualified voters who cast votes in the last gubernatorial Election but not fewer than 70 voters.

Should fewer qualified voters than required by this Ordinance sign the petition in the specific time, the petition shall have no further force or effect, and all proceedings thereon shall be terminated.  A request to inititiate the same amendment may not be accepted by the Clerk until 120 days after the expiration of the previous filing period.

Upon receipt of certification, the Planning Board shall within 30 days hold a public hearing, notice of which shall be given at least 7 days in advance by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the Town of Holden and by posting a notice at the Municipal Building and another public place in Holden, and shall within 60 days after said public hearing hold a municipal election for the purpose of submitting to vote
the question of adopting such amendment.

Any such proposed amendment shall be examined by the town attorney before being circulated for signatures.  The town attorney is authorized to edit the form of such proposed amendment for the purpose of avoiding repetitions, illegalities, and unconstitutional provisions, and to assure accuracy in its text and references, and clarity and precision in its phraseology, but he/she shall not materially change its meaning and effect.  If the town attorney cannot edit or correct the proposed amendment, he/she shall so advise the requesting committee who may revise the proposed amendment.  If not revised, the town attorney shall advise the voters at the public hearing of the shortcomings of the proposed amendment.

When an amendment to this Ordinance is proposed by other than the municipal officers or Planning Board, a fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250 plus public hearing costs) shall accompany the proposal to cover the cost of review, hearings, and advertisements.  This fee is non-refundable.

It is further the intention and direction of this Section that if this Ordinance is, for any reason, held to be invalid or void in its entirety, that the Ordinances repealed by this Section shall be automatically revived.
 

201	NON-CONFORMITY DEFINED

A legally existing (grandfathered) non-conforming lot, structure, sign, or use that lawfully existed immediately prior to the enactment of the Ordinance, or any subsequent amendment hereto, and which, as a result of the enactment or subsequent amendment, fails to comply with any of the requirements of this Ordinance.  Such requirements shall include, but are not limited to, the use restrictions and lot standards for the zone in which it is located, or any Land Use Standards set forth in Articles 5 and 6.  An illegal non-conformity is any lot, structure, sign, or use that fails to comply with
any of the requirements of this Ordinance or its amendments.

202	GENERAL  PROVISIONS

The following provisions apply to non-conformities generally:

202.1	NORMAL REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

The normal upkeep and maintenance of non-conforming structures including repairs or renovations which do not involve expansion of the non-conforming use or structure, and such other changes in a non-conforming use or structure as Federal, State, or local building and safety codes may require are permitted.

202.2	TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP

Any legal non-conformity may be transferred and the new owner may, subject strictly to the requirements of this Section, continue such non-conformity, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit any person or entity to occupy or use any lot or structure or to continue any use in violation of any other Federal, State, or Municipal statute, ordinance, or regulation.

202.3	ILLEGAL NON-CONFORMITY

Any illegal non-conformity shall cease or be corrected immediately. Any continuation of an illegal non-conformity is a violation of this Ordinance.

202.4	BURDEN OF PROOF RELATED TO ESTABLISHING LEGAL NON-CONFORMITY

The burden of establishing that any non-conformity is a legal non-conformity shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such non-conformity and not upon the Town of Holden.

202.5	CONVERSION TO CONFORMITY ENCOURAGED

All non-conformities shall be encouraged to convert to conformity whenever possible and, when required by this Ordinance, shall convert to conformity.

202.6	REVERSION TO NON-CONFORMITY  PROHIBITED

Once converted to conformity, no lot, structure, or use shall revert to non-conformity.

203	NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES

The following provision shall apply to non-conforming structures:

203.1	EXPANSION OF NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES

A non-conforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority identified in Article 4, as that for a new structure, if such addition or
 

expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the structure.   Such expansion is further limited as follows:

203.1.1	After January 1, 1989 if any portion of a structure is less than the required setback from the normal high-water line of a water body or tributary stream or the upland edge of a wetland, that portion of the structure shall not be expanded in floor area or volume, by thirty percent (30%) or more, during the lifetime of the structure. If a replacement structure conforms with the requirements of Section 203.3, and is less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland, the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on January 1, 1989, had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since that date.

203.1.2	Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a non­ conforming structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria specified in
Section 203.2, Relocation, below if;

203.1.2.1	the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure except for expansion in conformity with Section 203.1, above; and

203.1.2.2	the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the structure (from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.

203.1.3	No structure which is less than the required setback from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland shall be expanded toward the water body, tributary stream or wetland.

203.2	RELOCATION OF NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES

A non-conforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee, and  provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State Law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater  Disposal Rules or that a new system can be installed in a manner that causes the system to be less
non-conforming.

In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the "greatest practical extent", the Planning Board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as follows:

203.2.1	Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
 

Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be re-established within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.

203.2.2	Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel, the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees or a combination thereof.

203.3	RECONSTRUCTION  OR REPLACEMENT OF NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES:

Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland, or from the property line, or which otherwise fails to meet the dimensional requirements of the Ordinance, and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of cause, by more than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced within
eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body, tributary stream, wetland, or property line setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance.  In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to Section 203.1, above, as determined by the non-conforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be replaced in accordance with Section 203.2, above.

Any structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, wetland, or property line and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value, or damaged or destroyed by fifty percent (50%) or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repairs, may be repaired or reconstructed in place within eighteen (18) months of such damage or destruction, with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer.

In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets setbacks to the "greatest practical extent" the Planning Board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in Section 203.2 above, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.  It is not the intent of this Section to require the destruction of functional concrete or block foundations in order to meet setback requirements.

203.4	CHANGE OF USE OF A NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURE IN THE SHORELAND AREA

The use of a non-conforming structure in the Shoreland Area may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will not have a greater adverse impact on the water body, tributary stream or wetland, or on the property on which it is located or on adjacent properties and resources than the existing use.

In determining that "no greater adverse impact" will occur, the Planning Board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, flood plain management, archaeological and historic resources, and other functionally water-dependent  uses.
 

204	EXISTING NON-CONFORMING  MOBILE HOMES

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, the lawful use of a mobile home as a single­ family dwelling, in any zone, which use legally existed on the date of the enactment of this Ordinance may be continued, except that the mobile home shall not be:

204.1	Rebuilt, altered, or repaired after being damaged in excess of fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at the time of destruction as determined by the Code Enforcement Officer, except that such mobile home may be replaced as provided in the exception contained in Section 204.2 below, or may be rebuilt or repaired to its original condition if the mobile home had, before destruction, been certified or excluded as provided in said exception; or

204.2	Replaced with a different mobile home, unless the new mobile home is certified, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sub-Section 5415, as amended, as conforming to all applicable Federal
manufactured home construction and safety standards, or is excluded from the coverage of 42
U.S.C. Sub-Section 5401 et seq. Any mobile home lawfully used as a single-family dwelling may be improved by the addition of a foundation or by other new construction, alteration, or repair, subject to the requirements of any applicable building code or other law, and subject to
the other provisions of Articles 5 and 6.

205	NON-CONFORMING  USES

The following provisions shall apply to non-conforming uses:

205.1	EXPANSION

Expansion of non-conforming uses is prohibited.

205.2	RESUMPTION  PROHIBITED

A lot, building, or structure in or on which a non-conforming use ceases to be actively pursued for a period exceeding one (1) year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a non-conforming use.

206.2	CONTIGUOUS BUilT LOTS

If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional
requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot, the non­ conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. sections 4807-A through 4807-D) and the Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.

Within the shoreland zone only, if two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this Ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules are complied with.  When such lots are divided each lot thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.

206.3	CONTIGUOUS LOTS - VACANT OR PARTIALLY BUILT

If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principal structure the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirements.
 
 
 

301	ZONES ESTABLISHED

For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Town of Holden is hereby divided into the following Zones:

Growth Zones

301.1	General Commercial Zone (GC).
301.2	Limited Commercial Zone (LC).
301.3	Community Service/Institutional Zone (CS/I).
301.4	Village Center Zone (VC)
301.5	High Density Residential Growth Zone (R1G)

Rural Zones

 
301.6
301.7
301.8
301.9
301.10
301.11
301.12
301.13
 
High Density Residential Zone (R1). Low Density Residential Zone (R2). Rural Resource/Residential Zone (R3). Shoreland Residential Zone (R4). Resource Protection Zone (RP). Stream Protection Overlay Zone (SP) Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone (AP)
Telecommunications  Overlay Zone (TC)
 

302	STANDARDS  ESTABLISHING ZONES

Growth Zones

302.1	GENERAL COMMERCIAL ZONE (GC)

The General Commercial Zone is established to provide locations for business activities requiring large scale buildings, large outdoor display areas and wholesale areas, and extensive site development providing employment and service beyond the immediate neighborhood or community.

302.2	LIMITED COMMERCIAL ZONE (LC)

The Limited Commercial Zone is established to provide locations for the traditional retail and service needs of the local community and adjacent neighborhoods.  The scale of commercial development in these areas is intended to be in keeping with the residential character of these areas.  The intent is to limit larger outdoor display areas and wholesale businesses.

302.3	COMMUNITY SERVICE/INSTITUTIONAL  ZONE (CS/I)

The Community Service/Institutional Zone is established to provide locations for a range of public, semi-public, and institutional activities, as well as limited private retail and service uses, all established to serve the local community or neighborhood.  Such uses should be compatible with the traditional village setting and of a scale in keeping with the residential development of these areas.

302.4	VILLAGE CENTER ZONE (VC)

The Village Center Zone is established to encourage a new TownNillage Center as shown on the Zoning Map. The minimum lot size and frontage requirements are smaller in order to encourage a greater density of development than in other parts of the community, and uses are limited to those which would be compatible with a traditional village center.
 

302.5	HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL GROWTH ZONE (R1G)

The High Density Residential Growth Zone is established to encourage high density residential growth within the center of the community. The R1G Zone is the same as the R1 Zone except that in the RIG Zone, an additional dwelling is allowed in the same structure without an increase in the required minimum lot size (see Section 508 of this Ordinance).

Rural Zones

302.6	HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL ZONE (R1)

Encompassing most of the older reside·ntial neighborhoods and located within convenient reach of the business facilities, the R-1 Zones are expected to contain most of the multi­ family or apartment type dwellings likely to be needed by the community.  However, in harmony with the established neighborhoods, the predominant land use will probably continue to be single-family residences.  As in the R-2 Zones, certain additional uses which contribute to balanced neighborhoods and enhance the attractiveness of the community are permitted.

302.7	LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL ZONE (R2)

The R-2 Zone is established as a zone primarily for single-family dwellings.  Other uses permitted in the zone are those which are harmonious with the traditional pattern and character of these residential neighborhoods.

302.8	RURAL RESOURCE/RESIDENTIAL ZONE (R3)

Encompassing most of the area outside the settled areas, the R-3 Zones are intended for the kinds of uses which have traditionally predominated in rural New England, forestry and farming, farm residence, and a scattering of varied uses not inconsistent with a generally open, non-intensive pattern of land use.
The minimum lot size requirement is high in order to prevent over-development where a full
range of Town services cannot be provided economically.

302.9	SHORELAND RESIDENTIAL ZONE (R4)

The Shoreland Residential Zone is established to provide locations for recreational residences in shmefront areas. Such areas are intended for limited non-permanent habitation.

302.10	RESOURCE PROTECTION ZONE (RP)

The Resource Protection Zone includes:

302.10.1	Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of freshwater wetlands and wetlands associated with great ponds, which are rated "moderate" or "high" value waterfowl and wading bird habitat, including nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) that  are depicted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer maintained by either MDIF& W or the Department as of December 31, 2008. For the purposes of this paragraph, "wetlands associated with great ponds" shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation and hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond, and have a surface elevation at or below the water level of the great pond during the period of normal high water. "Wetlands associated with great ponds" are considered to be part of that great pond.
 

302.10.2	Shoreland areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of twenty percent (20%) or greater.

302.10.3	Shoreland areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric soils, which are not part of a freshwater wetland as defined, and which are not sufficiently connected to a water body during the period of normal high water.

302.11	STREAM PROTECTION OVERLAY ZONE (SP)

The land within seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a stream. Land uses and activities in the Stream Protection Overlay Zone must comply with the Shoreland Standards of Article 6 of this Ordinance, in addition to the standards applicable to the Zone which is overlayed.

302.12	AQUIFER PROTECTION OVERLAY ZONE (AP)

The Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone applies as an overlay zone to the land within the boundaries of the Town's identified sand and gravel aquifers, plus the land within 500 feet of those aquifers.  In addition to uses prohibited in the underlying district, specific additional uses that could adversely impact the aquifer are prohibited, and there are additional requirements for other uses requiring Site Plan Review.

302.13	TELECOMMUNICATIONS  OVERLAY ZONE (TC)

The Telecommunications Overlay Zone is the only zone outside of the General Commercial Zone in which telecommunications towers are permitted. By limiting towers to these zones, the Ordinance seeks to comply with the requirements of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, while preserving the scenic beauty of the Town. Certain landscaping, buffering, fencing, and aesthetic requirements apply as additional requirements for Site Plan Approval of telecommunications towers in the Telecommunications  Overlay Zone.

303	OFFICIAL ZONING MAP

Zones established by this Ordinance are defined and bounded as shown on the official "Zoning Map of Holden, Maine" which, together with its notations and amendments, from time to time, is hereby made a part of this Ordinance.

The official copy of the map shall be that map which bears the certification that it is true and correct, signed by the Chairman of the Planning Board and attested by the Town Clerk, and on file in the office of the Town Clerk.

304	INTERPRETATION OF ZONE BOUNDARIES

Where uncertainty exists as to boundary lines of Zones as shown on the official "Zoning Map of Holden, Maine," the following rules of interpretation shall apply:

304.1	Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways, public utilities or right-of-ways shall be construed as following such center lines;

304.2	Boundaries indicated as approximately following property lines shall be construed as following property lines;

304.3	Boundaries indicated as approximately following shore lines of any lake or pond shall be construed as following the normal high water mark;

304.4	Boundaries indicated as being the extension of center lines of streets shall be construed to be the extension of such center lines;
 

304.5	Boundaries indicated as being the extension of property lines shall be construed to be extensions of such property lines;

304.6	Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following the channel center line of such watercourses;

304.7	Boundaries indicated as being parallel to or extension of features listed above shall be so construed.  Distances not specifically indicated on the official map shall be determined by the scale of the map; and

304.8	Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official map, or in other circumstances where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of a boundary, the Code Enforcement Officer shall interpret the zone boundaries.

	GROUNDWATER  IMPACT ANALYSIS

For projects requiring Site Plan Review, the Planning Board shall require submittal by the applicant of a Groundwater Impact Analysis.  The Analysis shall be prepared by a State of Maine Certified Geologist with experience in hydrogeology.  The Analysis shall contain the following components unless waived by a specific vote of the Board.  (The Board expects the detail of this Analysis to vary with the intensity of the development.)

	A map showing: (1) soil types and (2) surficial geology on the property (3) the recommended sites for subsurface waste disposal systems and wells in the development; and (4) direction of ground water flow.

	The relationship of surface drainage conditions to ground water conditions.

	Documentation of existing ground water quality for the site.

	A nitrate analysis or other contaminant analysis as applicable including calculation of levels at the property line(s) and wells on the property.

	For water intensive uses, analysis of the effects of aquifer drawdown on the quantity and quality of water available for other water supplies or potential water supplies.

	The Planning Board may require installation and regular sampling of water quality monitoring wells for any use or proposed use deemed to be a significant actual or potential source of pollutants or excessive drawdown.  The number, location and depth of monitoring wells shall be determined as part of the Hydrogeologic Study, and wells shall be installed and sampled in accordance with "Guidelines for Monitoring Well Installation and Sampling" (Tolman, Maine Geologic Survey, 1983). Water quality sample results from monitoring wells shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer with evidence showing that contaminant concentrations meet the performance standard for pollution levels.

	A list of assumptions made to produce the required information.

	CONDITIONS/STANDARDS

In addition to the Site Plan Review Standards, the following standards shall be met:
 

	Sanitary Waste Water Disposal

	No use including home occupations shall dispose of other than normal domestic waste water on-site.  Disposal of waste water shall be in strict compliance with the State Plumbing Code and other relevant state and local laws, rules and ordinances.

	No more than 900 gallons per day of sanitary waste shall be discharged to any one subsurface wastewater disposal system.

	PETROLEUM STORAGE:  For above ground or indoor storage, an impermeable diked area shall be provided; the diked areas must be roofed to prevent accumulation of rainwater in the diked area and shall be properly ventilated.  There shall be no drains in the facility.  All concrete, whether walls or pads, shall be reinforced concrete and shall be designed by a Professional Engineer Registered in the State of Maine. Where required by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection a "Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure Plan (SPCC)" shall be prepared and submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer.

	EXCAVATION OR MINING FILL, SAND, GRAVEL AND OTHER MINERALS:
Excavation shall not be allowed below five feet above the average seasonal high water.  The water table shall not be artificially lowered by ditches, trenches, pumping or other methods.

408	TELECOMMUNICATIONS  TOWERS

	LOCATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS  OVERLAY ZONE

The Telecommunications  Overlay Zone shall encompass the land as shown on the Zoning Map of Holden, Maine.

	ADDITIONAL  REQUIREMENTS

The following requirements apply to Site Plan Approval of telecommunications towers. These requirements are established in addition to the performance standards of Article 5. Where the performance standards of Article 5 and this section conflict, this section controls.

	Towers shall be of galvanized steel finish or be painted a neutral color, so as to minimize their visual presence.

	All telecommunications towers, guys and any accessory structures, shall maintain the required setbacks as undisturbed vegetative buffers, except for the access road. The Planning Board may require additional plantings in the buffer area to maximize the effectiveness of the buffer area. The size, spacing, and types of plantings shall be subject to Planning Board approval. Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.

	All structures at the tower site shall use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will cause the tower and all related structures to blend into the natural environment to the maximum possible extent.

	Towers shall not be lighted unless required by state and federal law. If lighting is required, the Planning Board may select the lighting scheme it deems most appropriate from the alternatives acceptable under the law.

	Road access to the tower site shall be a minimum width necessary to allow safe and reasonable access to the site.
 

	A security fence of not less than eight feet (8') in height above finished grade shall surround the tower. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate.

	Co-location of telecommunications  equipment on an existing tower or a single new tower shall be encouraged prior to the approval of a new telecommunications towers.

	VARIANCES  FROM HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS  TOWERS

408.3.1.    All telecommunications towers located outside of the General Commercial Zone are subject to a height limit of one hundred twenty feet (120'). The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a variance to that height limit subject to the procedures and criteria for variances and Article 12 of this ordinance, except that the term "undue hardship" shall mean that denying the variance shall have the effect of prohibiting all personal wireless services within the Town of Holden, and no alternate sites, towers or structures are available to provide such services. See Article 13 for the definition of "personal wireless services."

408.3.2	Telecommunication Towers and antennas within the General Commercial Zone shall be exempt from lot area, coverage, height and frontage requirements of the General Commercial Zone, and shall be located no closer than 2,500 feet from any other telecommunication towers. Additional Screening from abutting property owners may be required. Where visible to abutting properties or public right of ways, such buildings and structures must be architecturally similar to the surrounding buildings or structures.

	REMOVAL OF ABANDONED ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.

Any antenna or tower that is not operated during continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned regardless of the intent of the owner or operator, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Code Enforcement Officer notifying the owner of such abandonment.  If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the Code Enforcement Officer may initiate action
to remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense.
 
 
 

501    GENERAL

	PURPOSE

The purpose of the regulations contained in this section is to allow maximum utilization of land while assuring against adverse impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public interest.  This assurance is provided by separating the area of the Town of Holden into zones and permitting specific land uses within each, provided that a use meets all the additional criteria specified in this Ordinance.

	GENERAL STANDARDS

The following Land Use Standards shall govern all Permits and Approvals issued by the Code Enforcement Officer and the Planning Board.

Shoreland Standards are included in Article 6, which applies to land uses within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the normal high-water line of any great pond or river, within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the upland edges of a wetland, and seventy five feet (75') from a stream.  These shoreland standards are those mandated by the State of Maine as part of the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Law (Title 38, MRSA, Sections 435-446).

In reviewing applications submitted pursuant to this Ordinance, the Code Enforcement Officer or the Planning Board shall consider the following performance standards prior to issuing final approval.  In all instances the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant.

502   ACCESS TO THE SITE

	CAPACITY OF OFF-SITE ROADS

Vehicular access to the site shall be on roads which have adequate capacity to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the development.   Intersections on major access routes to the site within one-half (1/2) mile of any entrance road which are functioning at a Level of Service of C or better prior to the development shall function at a minimum at Level of Service C after development.   If any intersection is functioning at a Level of Service Dor lower prior to the development, the project shall not reduce the current Level of Service.

The Planning Board may approve a development not meeting this requirement if the applicant demonstrates that:

	A public agency has committed funds to construct the improvements necessary to bring the level of access to the required standard; or

	The applicant will assume financial responsibility for the improvements necessary to bring the level of service to the required standard and will guarantee the completion of the improvements within one (1) year of approval of the project.

	VEHICULAR ACCESS

The following standards apply to design and construction of vehicular access to properties provided that if there is a conflict between these standards and access management rules adopted by the Maine Department of Transportation, the stricter standard shall prevail:

	Each property shall be provided with vehicular access to the property by abutting private or public ways, provided that along Route 1A, owners of adjacent properties shall be encouraged to construct a single shared driveway meeting the standards of this Ordinance (see Section 502.3.4).  Private right-of-ways shall be protected by permanent easements.
 

	The following criteria shall be followed for entrances and/or driveways to any use other than single and two-family dwellings:

	All entrance and exit driveways shall be located and designed in profile and  grading to afford safety to traffic, provide for safe and convenient ingress and egress, to and from the site, and to minimize conflict with the flow of traffic.

	The dimensions of driveways shall be designed to adequately accommodate the volume and character of vehicles anticipated to be attracted daily.

	Provision shall be made for convenient and safe emergency vehicle access to all buildings and structures at all times.

	For a distance of twenty feet (20') from the intersection of any two (2) streets along street lines no wall, fence, sign, or other structure and no hedges, trees, or other growth shall be planted or erected in such a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of two and one­ half (2 1/2) and ten feet (1O') above street level.

	Any exit driveway or driveway lane shall be so designed in profile and grading and so located as to provide the following minimum sight distance measured in each direction.  The measurements shall be from the driver's seat of a vehicle standing on that portion of the exit driveway with the front of the vehicle a minimum of ten feet (1O') behind the curbline or edge of shoulder.

NOTE:		Medium Volume Driveways - Driveways with a traffic volume of less than 1,500 vehicle trips per day or less than 150 vehicle trips per peak hour.

High Volume Driveways - Driveways with a traffic volume of 1,500 or more vehicle tips per day and more than 150 vehicle trips per peak hour.

	Where a site occupies a corner of two (2) intersecting roads, no driveway entrance or exit shall be located with fifty feet (50') of the point of tangency of the existing or proposed curb radius of that site.  Access to the lot shall be provided across the frontage and to the street where there is less potential for traffic congestion and for hazards to traffic and pedestrians.
 

	The intersection of any access drive or proposed street shall function at a Level of Service of C following development if the project will generate four hundred (400) or more vehicle trips per twenty-four (24) hour period or at a level which shall allow safe access into and out of the project if less than four hundred (400) trips are generated. Projects generating
four hundred (400) or more vehicle trips per twenty-four (24) hour period shall provide two (2) or more separate points of vehicular access into and out of the site. (see Section 502.3.4)

	In all Zones where two (2) or more driveways connect on a single site to any one (1) road, a minimum clear distance of one hundred feet (100') measured along the right-of-way shall separate the closest edges of any two (2) such driveways, unless the driveways are one way only, then the minimum clear distance shall be no less than fifty feet (50'). (see Sections 502.3.3 and 502.3.4)

	Angles. Driveways used for two-way operation shall intersect the road at an angle of or as near to ninety (90) degrees as site conditions will permit and in no case less than sixty (60) degrees. Driveways used by vehicles in one (1) direction of travel (right-turn only) shall not form an angle smaller than forty-five (45) degrees with the road, unless acceleration and deceleration lanes are provided.

	Dimensions. The dimensions of driveways shall be designed to adequately accommodate the volume and character of vehicles anticipated.  The required maximum and minimum dimensions for driveways are indicated below.  Driveways serving large volumes of daily traffic or traffic of over fifteen percent (15%) truck traffic shall be required to utilize high to maximum dimensions.

601    GENERAL

All land use activities within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the normal high-water line of any great pond or river, within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the upland edge of a freshwater wetland, or within
seventy-five feet (75') of the high-water line of a stream shall conform with the following provisions, if
applicable.

602    AGRICULTURE

602.1	All spreading of manure shall be accomplished in conformance with the Manure utilization Guidelines published by the Maine Department of Agriculture on November 1, 2001, and the Nutrient Management Law (7 M.R.S.A. sections 4201-4209).

602.2.   Manure shall not be stored or stockpiled within one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, of a great pond or a river flowing to a great pond, or within seventy-five feet (75') horizontal distance, of other water bodies, tributary streams, or wetlands. All manure storage areas within the shoreland zone must be constructed or modified such that the facility produces no discharge of effluent or contaminated storm water.

602.3	Agricultural activities involving tillage of soil greater than forty thousand (40,000) square feet in surface area within the shoreland zone shall require a Conservation Plan to be filed with and approved by the Planning Board.  Non-conformance with the provisions of said plan shall be considered to be a violation of this Ordinance.

Note: Assistance in preparing a Conservation Plan may be available through the local Soil and Water Conservation District Office.

602.4	There shall be no new tilling of soil within one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond; within seventy-five feet (75'). horizontal distance, from other water bodies; nor within twenty-five feet (25'), horizontal distance, of tributary streams, and wetlands.  Operations in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance and not in conformance with this provision may be maintained.

602.5	Newly established livestock grazing areas shall not be permitted within one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond; within seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance of other water bodies, nor; within twenty-five feet (25'), horizontal distance, of tributary streams, and wetlands.  Livestock grazing associated with ongoing farm activities, and which are not in conformance with the above setback provisions may continue, provided that such grazing is conducted in accordance with a Conservation Plan.

603    ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

The application for any proposed land use activity involving structural development or soil disturbance on or adjacent to sites listed on, or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the Planning Board shall be submitted by the applicant to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission for review and comment, at least twenty (20) days prior to action being taken by the Planning Board.  The Planning Board shall consider comments received from the Commission prior to rendering a decision on the application.

604    CLEARING OR REMOVAL OF VEGETATION FOR ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN TIMBER HARVESTING

	In a Resource Protection Zone (RP) abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, except for the removal of safety hazards and with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer.

Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection Zone (RP) the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
 

	Except in areas as described in 604.1 above, and except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line of a great pond or a river flowing to a great pond, and seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:

	There shall be no cleared opening greater than two hundred fifty (250) square feet in the forest canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present) as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown.  However, a footpath not to exceed six feet (6') in width as measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.

	Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained.  For the purposes of this section a "well-distributed stand of trees adjacent to a great pond or a river or stream flowing to a great pond, shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of twenty four (24) or more in any twenty-five (25) foot by fifty (50) foot rectangle (1,250 square feet) area as determined by the following rating system:

Diameter of Tree at 4 1/2 Feet Above Ground Level	Points
2 - 4 inches	1
>4 - 8 inches	2
8 -12 inches	4
>12in	8

Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of trees" is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of sixteen (16) per twenty-five (25) foot by 50-foot rectangular area.

NOTE: As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot x 50-foot plot contains four (4) trees between 2 and 4 inches in diameter, two trees between 4 and 8 inches in diameter, three trees between 8 and 12 inches in diameter, and two trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:

(4 x 1) + (2 x 2) + (3 x 4) + (2 x 8)= 36 points

Thus, the 25-foot by 50-foot plot contains trees worth 36 points. Trees totaling 12 points (36-24=12) may be removed from the plot provided that no cleared openings are created.

The following shall govern in applying this point system:

604.2.2.1 The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangle plots must be established where the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;

604.2.2.1 Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot;

604.2.2.3	Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
 

604.2.2.4	Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;

604.2.2.5	Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter.

For the purposes of Section 604.2.2 "other natural vegetation" is defined as retaining existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2) inches in diameter at four and
one half (4 %) feet above ground level for each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until five saplings have been recruited into the plot.

Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than forty percent (40%) of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at four and one-half feet (4 1/2') above ground level may be removed in any ten (10) year period.

604.2.3	In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three feet (3') in height and other ground cover including leaf litter and the forest duff layer shall not be cut, covered or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in Section 604.2.1 above.

604.2.4	Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom third (1/3) of a tree is allowed.

604.2.5	In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm­ damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present.

The provisions contained in Section 604.2 above shall not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the minimum area necessary.

604.3	At distances greater than one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, from a great pond or river flowing to a great pond, and seventy-five feet (75), horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland,  there shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten (10) year period, selective cutting of not more than forty percent (40%) of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured four and one-half feet (4 1/2') above ground level.  Tree removal in conjunction with the
development of permitted uses shall be included in the forty percent (40%) calculation.  For the purposes of these standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.

In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to, principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) of the lot area within the shoreland zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is greater, including land previously cleared.

604.4	Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be maintained, but shall not be enlarged, except as allowed by this Ordinance.

604.5	Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of this section.

605    COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES

The following new commercial and industrial uses are prohibited within the shoreland zone adjacent to great ponds, and rivers and streams which flow to great ponds:
 

Auto washing facilities

606    CONVERSION OF SEASONAL DWELLINGS

	Prior to converting a seasonal dwelling, as defined in this Ordinance, to a year-round or principal dwelling, the owner or his/her authorized agent shall obtain a conversion permit from the Town of Holden Plumbing Inspector. The Plumbing Inspector shall not approve a conversion permit if a holding tank is used as a means of wastewater disposal or storage.  The Plumbing Inspector shall issue a permit for conversion of a seasonal dwelling to a year-round dwelling if one of the following conditions is met:

	A subsurface wastewater disposal application, completed after July 1, 1974, exists indicating that the dwelling's wastewater disposal system substantially complies with Maine Department of Human Services rules and applicable Town ordinance provisions, provided that the disposal system was installed with the required permit and certificate of approval; or

	A replacement system for an existing wastewater disposal system has been constructed so that it substantially complies with Maine Department of Human Service rules and applicable Town ordinances; or

	The dwellings unit's wastewater is connected to an approved sanitary sewer system.

	It shall be a violation of this Ordinance to convert a seasonal to a year-round dwelling without the required conversion permit.   For the purposes of this requirement, a seasonal
dwelling is a dwelling which existed on December 31, 1981, and which was not used as a principal or year-round residence during the period from 1977 to 1981. A year-round dwelling is a dwelling which meets one of the following criteria:

	The dwelling is listed as an occupant's legal residence for the purpose of voting, filing a tax return, or automobile registration; or

	The dwelling has been occupied for a period exceeding seven (7) months in any calendar year.

607	EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL

	All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which result in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit under this Ordinance shall also require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan.  The plan shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board for approval, as required, and shall include, where applicable, provisions for:

	Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
 

	Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.

	Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or riprap.

	In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with the topography and soils of the site.  Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.

	Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity.  The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.

	Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures.   In all cases permanent stabilization shall occur within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure.   In addition:

	Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred (500) square feet and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.

	Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg, and twine or other suitable method may be required to maintain the mulch cover.

	Additional measures shall be taken where necessary in order to avoid siltation into the water.  Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt fences.

	Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion from water flowing through them.   Drainage ways shall be designed and constructed in order to carry water from a twenty-five (25) year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with riprap.

608	ESSENTIAL SERVICES

	Where feasible, the installation of essential services shall be limited to existing public ways and existing service corridors.

	The installation of essential services, other than road-side distribution lines, is not allowed in a Resource Protection Zone (RP) nor within 75 feet of a stream, except to provide services to a permitted use within said district, or except where the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable alternative exists.  Where allowed, such structures and facilities shall be located so as to minimize any adverse impacts on surrounding uses and resources, including visual impacts.

	Damaged or destroyed public utility transmission and distribution lines, towers and related equipment may be replaced or reconstructed without a permit.

609	INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE CAMPSITES

Individual, private campsites not associated with campgrounds are allowed provided the following conditions are met:

	One campsite per lot of record existing on the effective date of this Ordinance, or per forty­ three thousand five hundred and sixty (43,560) square feet of lot area within the shoreland zone, whichever is less dense, may be permitted.
 

	Campsite placement on any lot, including the area intended for a tent platform, shall be set back one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond or river flowing to a great pond, and seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland.

	Only one recreational vehicle shall be allowed on a campsite. The recreational vehicle shall not be located on any type of permanent foundation except for a gravel pad, and no structure except a canopy shall be attached to the recreational vehicle.

	The clearing of vegetation for a pre-existing recreational vehicle, tent or similar shelter in a Resource Protection District shall be limited to one thousand (1,000) square feet.

	A written sewage disposal plan describing the proposed method and location of sewage disposal shall be required for each campsite and shall be approved by the Local Plumbing Inspector.  Where disposal is off-site, written authorization from the receiving facility or land owner is required.

	When a recreational vehicle, tent or similar shelter is placed on-site for more than one hundred and twenty (120) days per year, all requirements for residential structures shall be met, including the installation of a subsurface sewage disposal system in compliance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater  Disposal Rules unless served by public sewage facilities.

610	MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION

Mineral exploration and extraction are prohibited.

611	MINIMUM LOT STANDARDS

	All lots in the Shoreland Residential Zone (R4) shall contain a minimum of one (1) acre
(43,560 square feet) per dwelling unit, and have a minimum shore frontage of two hundred feet (200'). All lots for any governmental, institutional, commercial or industrial structure in any shoreland zone shall be 60,000 square feet and 300 feet of frontage per principal structure.

	Land below the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland and land beneath roads serving more than two (2) lots shall not be included toward calculating minimum lot area.

	Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall be considered each a separate tract or parcel of land unless such road was established by the owner of land on both sides thereof after September 22, 1971.

	The minimum width of any portion of any lot within one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland shall be equal to or greater than the shore frontage requirement for a lot with the proposed use.

	If more than one residential dwelling unit, principal governmental, institutional, commercial or industrial structure or use, or combination thereof, is constructed or established on a single parcel, all dimensional requirements shall be met for each additional dwelling unit, principal structure or use.

612	PARKING AREAS

	Parking areas shall meet the shoreline and tributary stream setback requirements for structures for the zone in which such areas are located. The setback requirement for parking areas serving public boat launching facilities shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, from the shoreline or tributary stream if the Planning Board finds that no other reasonable alternative exists further from the shoreline or tributary stream.
 

	Parking areas shall be adequately sized for the proposed use and shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from flowing directly into a water body, tributary stream or wetland, and where feasible, to retain all runoff on-site.

	In determining the appropriate size of proposed parking facilities, the following shall apply:

	Typical parking space:  Approximately ten feet (1O') wide and twenty feet ( 20') long, except that parking spaces for a vehicle and boat trailer shall be forty feet (40') long.

	Internal travel aisles:  Approximately twenty feet (20') wide.

	Access to the shore shall be developed on soils appropriate for such use and constructed so as to control erosion.

	The location shall not interfere with existing developed or natural beach areas.

	The facility shall be located so as to minimize adverse effects on fisheries.

	The facility shall be no larger in dimension than necessary to carry on the activity and be consistent with the surrounding character and uses, of the area. A temporary pier, dock or wharf shall not be wider than six feet for non-commercial uses.

	No new structure shall be built on, over or abutting a pier, wharf, dock, or other structure extending beyond the normal high-water line of a water body or within a wetland unless the structure requires direct access to the water body or wetland as an operational necessity.

	New permanent piers and docks shall not be permitted unless it is clearly demonstrated to the Planning Board that a temporary pier or dock is not feasible, and a permit has been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection, pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act.

	No existing structures built on, over or abutting a pier, dock, wharf or other structure extending beyond the normal high-water line of a water body or within a wetland shall be converted to residential dwelling units in any district.

	Structures built on, over or abutting a pier, dock, wharf or other structure extending beyond the normal high-water line of a water body or within a wetland shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height above  the pier, wharf, dock or other structure.

Note:		New permanent structures, and expansions thereof, projecting into or over water bodies shall require a permit from the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. section 480-C. Permits may also be required from the Army Corps of Engineers if located in navigable waters.

614	PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY  STRUCTURES

	All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back at least one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of great ponds and rivers that flow into great ponds, and seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland. In the Resource Protection District the setback requirement shall be 250 feet, horizontal distance, except for structures, roads, parking spaces or other regulated objects specifically allowed in that district in which case the setback requirements specified above shall apply.
 

	The water body, tributary stream or wetland setback provision shall not apply to structures which require direct access to the water body or wetland as an operational necessity, such as piers, docks and retaining walls, or to other functionally water-dependent  uses.

	Principal or accessory structures and expansions of existing structures which are permitted in the Shoreland Residential Zone (R4) and Resource Protection Zone shall not exceed thirty-five feet (35') in height.

	The lowest floor elevation or openings of all buildings and structures, including basements, shall be elevated at least one foot above the elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood, the flood of record, or in the absence of these, the flood as defined by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils. Accessory structures may be placed in accordance with the Floodplain Management Ordinance and need not meet the elevation requirements of this paragraph.

	The total footprint area of all structures, parking lots and other non-vegetated surfaces, within the shoreland area shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the lot or a portion thereof, located within the Shoreland Residential Zone (R4) and Resource Protection Zone, including land area previously developed. Structures in the Resource Protection District shall be subject to a special exception permit as set forth in Section 614.7.

	Retaining walls that are not necessary for erosion control shall meet the structure setback requirement, except for low retaining walls and associated fill provided all of the following conditions are met:

	The site has been previously altered and an effective vegetated buffer does exist;

	The wall(s) is (are) at least 25 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland;

	The site where the retaining wall will be constructed is legally existing lawn or is a site eroding from lack of naturally occurring vegetation, and which cannot be stabilized with vegetative plantings;

	The total height of the wall(s), in the aggregate, is not more than 24 inches;

	Retaining walls are located outside of the 100-year floodplain on rivers, streams, wetlands and tributary streams, as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these, by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils.

	The area behind the wall is revegetated with grass, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof, and no further structural development will occur within the setback area, including patios and decks; and

614.5.6	A vegetated buffer area is established within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland when a natural buffer area does not exist. The buffer area must meet the following characteristics:

614.7.3.1	Located on natural ground slopes of less than 20%; and

614.7.3.2	Located outside the floodway of the 100-year floodplain along river, based on detailed flood insurance studies and as delineated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps; all buildings, including basements, are elevated at least one foot above the 100-year floodplain elevation; and the development is otherwise in compliance with any applicable municipal floodplain ordinance.

If the floodway is not shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Maps, it is deemed to be % the width of the 100-year floodplain.

614.7.4	The total ground-floor area, including cantilevered or similar overhanging extensions, of all principal and accessory structures is limited to a maximum of 1,500 square feet provided that such structures shall not exceed the 20% lot coverage requirement. This limitation shall not be altered by variance.

614.7.5	All structures, except functionally water-dependent structures, are set back from the normal high-water line or upland edge of a wetland to the greatest practical extent, but not less that one hundred (100) feet from the normal high-water line of great ponds and seventy-five (75) feet from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland.  In determining the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board shall consider the depth of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the type and amount of vegetation to
 

be removed, the proposed building site's elevation in regard to the floodplain, and its proximity to moderate-value and high-value wetlands.

614.7.6	Expiration of Permit.  Following the issuance of a permit, if no substantial start is made in construction or in the use of the property within one year of the date of the permit, the permit shall lapse and become void.

615	ROADS AND DRIVEWAYS

The following standards shall apply to the construction of roads and/or driveways and drainage systems, culverts, and other related features.

	Roads and driveways shall be set back at least one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond or a river that flows to a great pond, and seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland unless no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the Planning Board.  If no other reasonable alternative exists, the Planning Board may reduce the road and/or driveway setback requirement to no less than fifty feet (50'), horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will be used to prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream or wetland.  Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling basins, and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so as to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland.

On slopes of greater than twenty percent (20%) the road and/or driveway setback shall be increased by ten feet (1O'), horizontal distance, for each five percent (5%), or fraction thereof, increase in slope above twenty percent (20%).

Section 615.1 does not apply to approaches to water crossings or to roads or driveways that provide access to permitted structures, and facilities located nearer to the shoreline or tributary stream due to an operational necessity, excluding temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to permitted structures within the setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of Section 615.1 except for that portion of the road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure.

	Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road right-of-way regardless of their setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland.

	New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection Zone (RP) except that the Planning Board may grant a permit to construct a road or driveway to provide access to permitted uses within the district. A road or driveway may also be approved by the Planning Board in a Resource Protection District upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the district. When a road or driveway is permitted in a Resource Protection District the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.

	Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation control contained in Section 607.

	Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten percent (10%) except for segments of less than two hundred feet (200').

	In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from directly entering water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least fifty feet (50') plus two times the average slope, in width between the outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high­ water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.  Surface drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote
 

infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.

	Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains sufficient volume or head to erode the road, driveway or ditch.  To accomplish this, the following shall apply:

	Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be spaced along the road or driveway at intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:

Grade (Percent)	Spacing (Feet)
0-2	250
3-5	200-135
6-10	100-80
11-15	80-65
16-20	60-45
21+	40

	Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only where the grade is ten percent (10%) or less.

	On sections having slopes greater than ten percent (10%), ditch relief culverts shall be placed at approximately a thirty (30) degree angle down slope from a line perpendicular to the centerline of the road or driveway.

	Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed in order to allow for effective functioning, and their inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with appropriate materials.

	Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm water runoff control installations associated with roads and driveways shall be maintained on a regular basis to assure effective functioning.

616    SEPTIC WASTE DISPOSAL

All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules and the following:

	Clearing or removal of woody vegetation necessary to site a new system and any associated fill extensions, shall not extend closer than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland; and

	A holding tank is not allowed for a first-time residential use in the shoreland zone.

Note: The Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules require new systems, excluding fill extensions, to be constructed no less than one hundred (100) horizontal feet from the normal high­ water line of a perennial water body. The minimum setback distance for a new subsurface disposal system may not be reduced by variance.
 

617   SIGNS

All signs in the Shoreland Residential (R4) and Resource Protection (RP) Zones shall conform to the provisions of the Holden Sign Ordinance.

618    SOILS

All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or structures can be established or maintained without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe erosion, mass soil movement, and water pollution, whether during or after construction.  Proposed uses requiring subsurface waste disposal, and commercial or industrial development and other similar intensive land uses, shall require a soils report based on an on-site investigation by state-certified professionals. Certified persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists, Maine Registered Professional Engineers, Maine State Certified Geologists, and other persons who have training and experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties. The report shall be based upon the analysis of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land and water areas, maximum ground water elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions, and other pertinent data which the evaluator deems appropriate. The soils report shall include recommendations for a proposed use to counteract soil limitations where they exist.

619    STORM WATER RUNOFF

	All new construction and development shall be designed to minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess of the natural predevelopment conditions. Where possible, existing natural runoff control features, such as berms, swales, terraces, and wooded areas shall be retained in order to reduce runoff and encourage infiltration of storm waters.

	Storm water runoff control systems shall be maintained as necessary to ensure proper functioning.

Note: The Stormwater Management Law (38 M.R.S.A. section 420-D) requires a full permit to be obtained from the DEP prior to construction of a project consisting of 20,000 square feet or more of impervious area or 5 acres or more of a developed area in an urban impaired stream watershed or most-at-risk lake watershed, or a project with 1 acre or more of developed area in any other stream or wetland watershed. A permit-by-rule is necessary for a project with one acre or more of disturbed area but less than 1 acre impervious area (20,000 square feet for most-at-risk lakes and urban impaired streams) and less than 5 acres of developed area. Furthermore, a Maine Construction General Permit is required if the construction will result in one acre or more of disturbed area.

620    TIMBER HARVESTING

	Within the strip of land extending seventy-five feet (75') inland from the normal high-water line in areas zoned as Resource Protection (RP) abutting a great pond there shall be no timber harvesting, except to remove safety hazards.

	Except in areas as described in 620.1 above, timber harvesting shall conform with the following provisions except that in no case shall the average residual basal area of trees over 4 % inches in diameter at 4 % feet above ground level be reduced to less than 30 square feet per acre:

620.2.1	Selective cutting of no more than forty percent (40%) of the total volume of trees four
(4) inches or more in diameter measured at four and one-half feet (4 1/2') above ground level on any lot in any ten (10) year period is permitted.  In addition:

620.2.1.1	Within one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance of the normal high­ water line of a great pond or a river flowing to a great pond, and within seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a
 

wetland, there shall be no clear cut openings and a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation, including existing ground cover, shall be maintained.

620.2.1.2	At distances greater than one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, of a great pond or a river flowing to a great pond, and greater than seventy-five feet (75'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting operations shall not create single clear cut openings greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in the forest canopy.  Where such
openings exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet they shall be at least
one hundred feet (100'), horizontal distance, apart.  Such clear cut openings shall be included in the calculation of total volume removal. Volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.

620.2.2	Timber harvesting in excess of forty percent (40%) of the volume may be permitted by the Planning Board upon a showing, including a forest management plan signed by a Maine licensed professional forester, that such exception is necessary for
sound forest management and will be carried out in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. The Planning Board shall notify the Commissioner of the
Department of Environmental Protection of each exception allowed, within fourteen
(14) days of the Planning Board's decision.

620.2.3	No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty feet (50'), horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body.  In all other areas slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends more than four feet (4') above the ground.  Any debris that falls below the normal high-water line of a water body or tributary stream shall be removed.

620.2.4	Timber harvesting equipment shall not use stream channels as travel routes except when:

620.2.4.1	Surface waters are frozen; and

620.2.4.2	The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.

620.2.5	All crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert, except in areas with low banks and channel beds which are composed of gravel, rock, or similar hard surface which would not be eroded or otherwise damaged.

620.2.6	Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and designed so as to prevent water runoff from directly entering the water body or tributary stream.  Upon completion of timber harvesting, temporary bridges and culverts shall be removed and areas of exposed soil revegetated.

620.2.7	Except for water crossings, skid trails, and other sites, where the operation of machinery used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil, the operation shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least seventy-five feet (75') horizontal distance, in width for slopes up to ten percent (10%) shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.  For each ten percent (10%), or fraction thereof, increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty feet (20') horizontal distance.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only to a face sloping toward the water body or wetland, provided, however, that no portion of such exposed mineral soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty-five feet (25') horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.
 

621   WATER QUALITY

No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or discharge to the waters of the State, any pollutant that, by itself or in combination with other activities or substances will impair designated uses or the water classification of the water body, tributary stream or wetland.
