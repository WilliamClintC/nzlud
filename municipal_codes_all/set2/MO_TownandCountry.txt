personal considerations; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain or the perception of personal

or a record, or a vote from the public and any other member believes that such motion, if
passed, would cause a meeting, record or vote to be closed from the public in violation of any
provision in Chapter 610, RSMo., or this Chapter, such latter member shall state his or her
objection to the motion at or before the time the vote is taken on the motion. The public
governmental body shall enter in the minutes of the public governmental body any objection
made pursuant to this Subsection. Any member making such an objection shall be allowed to
fully participate in any meeting, record or vote that is closed from the public over the
member's objection. In the event the objecting member also voted in opposition to the motion

made available pursuant to this Subsection.
Except as provided by this Section, any information acquired by a law enforcement agency by
way of a complaint or report of a crime made by telephone contact using the emergency
number, "911", shall be inaccessible to the general public. However, information consisting of

Section 610.100, RSMo. Any closed records pursuant to this Section shall be available upon
request by law enforcement agencies or the Division of Workers' Compensation or pursuant
to a valid court order authorizing disclosure upon motion and good cause shown.
If the person arrested is charged but the case is subsequently nolle prossed, dismissed, or the
accused is found not guilty or imposition of sentence is suspended in the court in which the action
is prosecuted, official records pertaining to the case shall thereafter be closed records when such
case is finally terminated except as provided in Section 610.120, RSMo., and except that the
court's judgment or order or the final action taken by the prosecutor in such matters may be
accessed. If the accused is found not guilty due to mental disease or defect pursuant to Section

Medical Records. All information obtained by the City regarding medical examinations, medical
condition or medical history of City employees or job applicants, if retained by the City, shall be
collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and shall be treated as
closed and confidential records, except that:
Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work
duties of employees and necessary accommodations;
First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the information reflects
the existence of a disability which might require emergency treatment; or
Government officials investigating compliance with State or Federal law pertaining to
treatment of persons with disabilities may be allowed access to such records.
Segregation Of Exempt Material. If a public record contains material which is not exempt from
disclosure, as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the Clerk shall separate the
exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt material available for examination
and copying in accord with the policies provided herein. When designing a public record the Clerk
shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If
the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form,
the Clerk shall generally describe the material exempted unless that description would reveal the
contents of the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.
Maintenance Of Closed Records. Records required to be closed shall not be destroyed, but they
shall be inaccessible to the general public and to all persons other than those authorized by
ordinance or State law, including but not limited to Section 610.120, RSMo.
Records and information that have been closed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, Chapter
610, RSMo., and other relevant State and Federal laws and regulations are to be treated as
confidential by all employees and elected and appointed officials of the City.
It shall be grounds for disciplinary action for any employee to:
Violate the confidentiality relating to such records or information;
Copy or remove closed and/or confidential information without the specific consent of the
custodian thereof or in the normal course of performing such employee's duties for the City;
Provide or discuss closed records or confidential information with any person other than as a
necessary part of performing such employee's duties for the City; or
Divulge, discuss or disclose information or records addressed in any closed meeting of a
public governmental body, other than as a necessary part of performing such employee's
duties for the City.
Elected and appointed officials are also expected to maintain the same strict standards
of confidentiality required of employees. Breach of the confidentiality standards
established by this Chapter and required of employees in this Section may be grounds
for removal from office or other sanctions as may be deemed appropriate by the body
of which such official is a member or by the Board of Aldermen.

and established fundraising program. Donated money will be expended for the specific purpose so
designated or for general purposes if no intent is specified. Donations of equipment will be
evaluated for usefulness, ongoing maintenance costs and potential future replacement cost. The
authorization of in-kind contributions and sponsorships for specific events will be treated in the
same way as donated funds. Corporations offering sponsorships or in-kind contributions will be
requested to state the value of the offer or service. The City Administrator will decide on a per
case basis if the donation should be accepted.
Authorization For The Board Of Aldermen To Accept Gifts Of More Than Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000.00). The Board of Aldermen shall have authority to make a final decision whether
to accept offers of donations to the City with a cumulative value over twenty-five thousand dollars

The City Administrator and the Board of Aldermen shall consider the following when determining
whether a donation should be accepted:
Whether the donor's designated use of the donation is consistent with existing City policies,
programs and City objectives;
Whether restrictions upon the use, disposal or retention of the donation are of such a nature
as to make the donation impractical to accept;
Whether the accounting for the donation is unduly complex or burdensome;
Whether the donation is likely to require a level of repair or maintenance which would make it
unduly burdensome or cost prohibitive to accept;
Whether the donation requires the purchase of other equipment or materials to make it useful
and which would in turn make it unduly burdensome or cost prohibitive to accept;
Whether acceptance of the donation is reasonably likely to present a conflict of interest or the
appearance of a conflict of interest for the City or City personnel.
Whether acceptance of the donation is reasonably likely to imply endorsement of commercial
products, services, companies or individuals; any political or religious views; or any particular
perspective on controversial community issues;
Whether the donation will result in additional operating costs for which a funding source has
not been identified and approved. For example, whether a one-time donation would require
additional funding from the City in subsequent years;
Whether acceptance of the donation poses a burdensome level of additional potential liability,
for example, due to the level of indemnifications, insurances, bonding or warranties requested
by the donor;
Whether the ownership of the item to be donated is well established and is able to be legally
transferred;
Whether the item to be donated is of such a nature as to be reasonably likely to offend
common sensibilities; and
Any other matters deemed pertinent by the City Administrator and the Board of Aldermen.

Any person in the custody, care, or control of the Department of Mental Health who is receiving
services from an operated, funded, licensed, or certified program.
Section 210.020. Attempt.
Guilt for an offense may be based upon an attempt to commit an offense if, with the purpose of
committing the offense, a person performs any act which is a substantial step towards the
commission of the offense. A "substantial step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the
firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution under this Section that the offense attempted was, under the
actual attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense
could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to
be.
Section 210.030. Conspiracy.
Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense when a person, with
the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, agrees with another person
or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.
No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense if,
after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

Section 210.040. Culpable Mental State — Applicable To This
Chapter.

A person "acts purposely", or with purpose, with respect to his/her conduct or to a result
thereof when it is his/her conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.
A person "acts knowingly", or with knowledge,
With respect to his/her conduct or to attendant circumstances when he/she is aware of
the nature of his/her conduct or that those circumstances exist; or
With respect to a result of his/her conduct when he/she is aware that his/her conduct is
practically certain to cause that result.
A person "acts recklessly" or is reckless when he/she consciously disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, and such disregard
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would
exercise in the situation.
A person "acts with criminal negligence" or is criminally negligent when he/she fails to be
aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, and
such failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable
person would exercise in the situation.
Section 210.050. Accountability For Conduct.
[CC 1989 §15-9; Ord. No. 1902 §1, 11-13-1995]
A person with the required culpable mental state is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his/her own
conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he/she is criminally responsible, or both.
Section 210.060. Responsibility for the Conduct of Another.
A person is criminally responsible for the conduct of another when:
The Statute defining the offense makes him or her so responsible; or
Either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose of promoting the
commission of an offense, he or she aids or agrees to aid or attempts to aid such other
person in planning, committing or attempting to commit the offense.
However, a person is not so responsible if:
He or she is the victim of the offense committed or attempted;
The offense is so defined that his or her conduct was necessarily incident to the commission
or attempt to commit the offense. If his or her conduct constitutes a related but separate
offense, he or she is criminally responsible for that offense but not for the conduct or offense
committed or attempted by the other person;
Before the commission of the offense such person abandons his or her purpose and gives
timely warning to law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the
commission of the offense.
The defense provided by Subsection (B)(2) of this Section is an affirmative defense.

Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay

Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.
This Section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more
difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the
lessee shall notify the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the expiration
of the lease or rental agreement or within ten (10) days after proper notice.

any other form of presentment involving the transmission of account information for the
payment of money knowing that it will not be paid by the drawee or that there is no such
drawee; or
Makes, issues or passes a check or other similar sight order or any other form of presentment

there is no such drawee.
As used in Subsection (A)(2) of this Section, "actual notice in writing" means notice of the nonpayment
which is actually received by the defendant. Such notice may include the service of
summons or warrant upon the defendant for the initiation of the prosecution of the check or checks
which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons or warrant contains information of
the ten-day period during which the instrument may be paid and that payment of the instrument
within such ten-day period will result in dismissal of the charges. The requirement of notice shall
also be satisfied for written communications which are tendered to the defendant and which the

shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another

such arrow, or other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.060,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.

Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.060, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.

intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and

signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his/her crossing on the walk signal
shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.

proceed until the school bus resumes motion, or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "school bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State law:
Stop while bus is loading and unloading". Each school bus subject to provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education, which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped no later than August 1, 1998, with a
crossing control arm. The crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5)
feet six (6) inches from the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on
the right side of the front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district shall have
the authority pursuant to this Section to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a school
bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or more
lanes may pull off the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to stop and
may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop;
provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided that the
emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers should
proceed with caution, and in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus
with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at any location
upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided by a median
or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic;
nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the road or highway
proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each
direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a speed limit
greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is
actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.

The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, or which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
The driver of any school bus, driving upon the streets or highways of this City after loading or
unloading school children, shall remain stopped if the bus is followed by three (3) or more
vehicles, until such vehicles have been permitted to pass the school bus, if the conditions
prevailing make it safe to do so.
If any vehicle is witnessed by a Peace Officer or the driver of a school bus to have violated the
provisions of this Section and the identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, it shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the person in whose name such vehicle is registered committed the
violation. In the event that charges are filed against multiple owners of a motor vehicle, only one of
the owners may be convicted and court costs may be assessed against only one of the owners. If
the vehicle which is involved in the violation is registered in the name of a rental or leasing
company and the vehicle is rented or leased to another person at the time of the violation, the
rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing the Peace Officer or
prosecuting authority with a copy of the rental or lease agreement in effect at the time of the
violation. No prosecuting authority may bring any legal proceedings against a rental or leasing
company under this Section unless prior written notice of the violation has been given to that
rental or leasing company by registered mail at the address appearing on the registration and the
rental or leasing company has failed to provide the rental or lease agreement copy within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of such notice.

opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and
conditions of the permit or this Section. Prior to revocation the Director shall provide
written notice to the responsible person identifying any substantial breach and allowing a
reasonable period of time not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure

applicable permit for the placement of facilities when also required by the Municipal Code.
Facilities Regulations.
The following general regulations apply to the placement and appearance of facilities:
Facilities shall be placed underground, except when other similar facilities exist above
ground or when conditions are such that underground construction is impossible,
impractical or economically unfeasible as determined by the City and when in the City's
judgment the above ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where
the construction is proposed. Facilities shall not be located so as to interfere or be likely
to interfere with any public facilities or use of public property.
Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. Nonresidential
zoning districts are preferred to residential zoning districts. Preferred locations
in order of priority in both type districts are rear yards and on a corner lot behind the
applicable setbacks, unless some other location is available. Placements within side
yards not bordered by a street or within front yards are discouraged.
Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective or metallic. Black, gray
and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Sight proof screening,
landscape or otherwise, may be required for facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or
covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to
reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of
landscaping materials shall be approved by the Director prior to installation of any facility
requiring landscape screening. The person responsible for the facilities shall be
responsible for the installation, repair or replacement of screening materials. Alternative
concealment may be approved by the Director to the extent it meets or exceeds the
purposes of these requirements.
Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner and so as to not emit any
unnecessary or intrusive noise and in accordance with all applicable provisions of the

extraneous markings on the facilities, except such necessary minimal markings approved
by the City as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or
emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or
regulation.
If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for facilities to the extent that the
exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director shall
cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but the
City shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the
applicant.
Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing or operating facilities, and the person
on whose behalf the work is being done, shall protect from damage any and all existing
structures and property belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all rights-of-way,
public property or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or
replaced and the responsible person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of the
damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time
specified by the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
The applicant shall provide written notice to all property owners within one hundred eighty-five
(185) feet of the site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any installation, replacement or
expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be
done, the location of work and the time and duration of the work.
At the City's direction, a person owning or controlling facilities shall protect, support,
disconnect, relocate or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to
accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation or maintenance of streets
or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety or welfare.
If a person installs facilities without having complied with the requirements of this Section or
abandons the facilities, said person shall remove the facilities and if the person fails to
remove the facilities within a reasonable period of time, the City may, to the extent permitted
by law, have the removal done at the person's expense.
Facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as
part of the City Code including, but not limited to, building codes, zoning requirements and the

Article V. Non-Conforming Use Regulations
Section 405.160. Purpose and Statement of Policy.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(5000), 11-13-1989]
A non-conforming use is one which existed lawfully, whether by variance or otherwise, on the date
this Chapter or any amendment thereto became effective, and which fails to conform to one (1) or
more of the applicable regulations and requirements in the Zoning Code or such amendments
thereto; provided that no lot improved with a single-family detached dwelling unit shall be deemed
a non-conforming use for purposes of obtaining any permit, if:
The improvements to be constructed pursuant to the permit meet all requirements of this
Chapter which pertain to those proposed improvements; and,
With the addition of the improvements called for by the permit, either:
The lot satisfies the minimum green space called for by this Chapter; or
The addition of the improvements would not decrease the amount of green space if the
minimum green space is already violated.
Non-conforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with and detrimental to the uses
permitted in the zoning district in which they are situated since they confer upon their owners and
users a position of unfair advantage. Non-conforming uses should be abolished and reduced to
conformity as quickly as the fair interest of the parties permit. Non-conforming uses shall be
subject to and comply with the regulations set forth in this Article.
Section 405.170. Change, Alteration, Expansion, Extension or
Termination of Non-Conforming Uses.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(5001), 11-13-1989]
Change. Except as provided in the Subsections below, a non-conforming use may be changed
only to a conforming use. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming
use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a non-conforming use.
Alteration, Expansion Or Extension. No extensions, alterations, expansions, enlargements or other
structural alterations of a building, structure or other portion of a non-conforming lot shall be
permitted except the following:
Interior alterations. A non-conforming use may be extended throughout a building or structure.
No interior alteration of a building shall be construed as the expansion of a non-conforming
use so long as the alteration does not affect the appearance of the exterior walls of the
building.

External alteration, expansion or change. External alteration, expansion or change to nonconforming
uses may be made where such external alteration, expansion or change is
required by law or ordinance, or where the Director deems such external alteration, expansion
or change is necessary to ensure the public safety, to secure the continued use of the building
or structure, or to bring the use of the building or structure more into conformity with the
provisions of the ordinance and thereby to diminish the non-conformity.
Existing multi-family and single-family, attached residential uses in annexed areas.
Existing multi-family and single-family, attached residential uses in any area annexed to
the City after November 30, 1983, which were legally conforming uses in the annexed
area at the time of annexation, shall be deemed permitted uses within the zoning districts
in which they are located in the City of Town and Country.
Existing multi-family and single-family, attached residential uses in any area annexed to
the City may be altered, expanded or extended consistent with the zoning standards
applicable in the area at the time of annexation, provided:
Such uses were conforming uses in the annexed area prior to annexation,
Plans for the existing multi-family or single-family, attached residential development
were approved prior to annexation by the authority with jurisdiction at that time, if
required by that authority, and
Said plans were recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in the County in
which the residential development is located. The City shall secure a copy of the
plans for the residential development prior to issuing a building permit for any multifamily
or single-family, attached dwelling within that development and ensure
compliance with the standards applicable to that development at the time the plans
for the development were recorded.
Existing single-family dwellings within Planned Residential Community (PRCS) in annexed
areas within the "SL" or "SM" zoning districts.
Existing single-family dwellings, both attached and unattached, which are located within
PRCs in the "SL" or "SM" zoning districts, which were annexed to the City after
November 30, 1983, and which were legal conforming uses in the annexed area at the
time of annexation, shall be deemed permitted uses within the zoning districts in which
they are located in the City of Town and Country.
An existing single-family dwelling within a PRC in the "SL" or "SM" zoning districts in any
area annexed to the City after November 30, 1983 may be altered, expanded or
extended consistent with the zoning standards applicable in that area at the time of
annexation, as reflected on the record plat for the PRC recorded in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds in the County in which the PRC is located, or where no such record
plat was recorded, on the recorded final development plan for the PRC, provided:
Such single-family dwelling was a conforming use in the annexed area prior to
annexation;
The PRC within which the single-family dwelling is located was approved prior to
annexation by the authority with jurisdiction at that time, if required by that authority;

For lots of less than 43,560 square feet, but of greater than or equal to 21,780 square feet, i.e. 21,780 SF < lot size
< 43,560 SF, which lots were existing at the time of annexation, the minimum
greenspace percentage shall be sixty percent (60%) to a maximum impervious
surface area of ten thousand eight hundred ninety (10,890).
For lots of less than 21,780 square feet, i.e., lot size < 21,780 SF, which lots were existing at the
time of annexation, the minimum greenspace percentage shall be fifty percent
(50%), to a maximum impervious surface area of 8,712 SF.
The City shall secure a copy of the record plat for the PRC, or where no record plat was
recorded, a copy of the recorded final development plan for the PRC, prior to issuing a
building permit for any single-family dwelling within that PRC and ensure compliance with
the standards set forth therein.
Moving. No non-conforming use of a building or structure may be moved to any other part of a
tract of land upon which the use was conducted at the time of the adoption of this Chapter, except
those required by law or ordinance, those which may be required for safety, or those allowed by
Subsection (G) below.
Restoration. Any non-conforming building or structure, or any building or structure containing a
non-conforming use, which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or by
public enemy may be restored to the same dimensions and volume as existed before such
destruction or damage.
Abandonment. Any non-conforming use which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be
reestablished. Any structure or land, or structure and land in combination, which was formerly
devoted to a non-conforming use which has been abandoned shall not again be devoted to any
use other than those uses which are permitted in the district in which the structure or land, or
structure and land in combination, is situated. The term "abandonment", as used herein, shall
mean the voluntary discontinuance of a use, when accompanied by an intent not to reestablish
such use. Any one (1) of the following shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to abandon:
Any positive act indicating such intent;
Any conscious failure to take all necessary steps to resume the non-conforming use within
reasonable dispatch in the circumstances, including advertising of the property for sale or
lease;
In the case of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, discontinuance of the
non-conforming use for twelve (12) consecutive months; or
In the case of land only, discontinuance of the non-conforming use for ninety (90) consecutive
days, or for a total of six (6) months during any one (1) year period.
Not Grounds For A Variance. The existence of a non-conforming use shall not in and of itself be
considered grounds for the Board of Adjustment to allow a variance for any other property.
The non-conformity of a property shall be measured as of the effective date of this Chapter and
where there exists on such date a mixture of uses on the property the uses may be interchanged
and mixed in different locations on the property thereafter so long as the combination of uses
remains essentially the same and does not increase or expand any aspect of the non-conformity
beyond that which existed on the date of the passage of this Chapter.

in this Section. The general criteria and preferences for granting same and the regulations
governing antennas and antenna support structures shall be as follows:
Building Codes and safety standards. All antennas and antenna support structures shall meet
or exceed the standards and regulations contained in applicable State and local Building and
Electrical Codes as well as the applicable standards published by the Electronics Industries
Association, as amended from time to time.
Regulatory compliance. All antennas and antenna support structures shall meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other Federal or State agency
with the authority to regulate antennas and support structures. Should such standards or
regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure into
compliance with the revised standards or regulations within six (6) months of the effective
date of the revision unless an earlier date is mandated by the controlling agency.
Security. All antennas and antenna support structures shall be protected from unauthorized
access by appropriate security devices. A description of proposed security measures shall be
provided as part of any application to install, build or modify antennas or support structures.
Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of any permit as deemed
necessary by the Director or the Board of Aldermen.
Lighting. Antenna support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or other
Federal or State agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the required
lighting scheme will be made a part of the application for conditional use permit.
Advertising. Unless a disguised support structure is in the form of a standard outdoor
advertising structure, the placement of advertising on antenna support structures is
prohibited.
Design.
Guyed towers are prohibited absent a determination by the Board of Aldermen as
provided in Subsections (E)(5)(b) or (E)(5)(c) of this Section.
Antenna support structures, except disguised support structures, shall maintain a
galvanized steel finish or, subject to the requirements of the City or the FAA, FCC or any
applicable Federal or State agency, be painted a neutral color consistent with the natural
or built environment of the site.
Shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the natural or built
environment of the site, and shall also comply with such other reasonable design
guidelines as may be required by the City.
Antennas attached to a building or disguised support structure shall be of a color identical
to or closely compatible with the surface to which they are mounted.
Towers shall be surrounded by a landscape strip of not less than ten (10) feet in width
and planted with materials which will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six
(6) feet. Said landscape strip shall be exterior to any security fencing. In lieu of the
required landscape strip, a minimum six (6) foot high decorative fence or wall may be
approved by the City upon demonstration by the applicant that an equivalent degree of
visual screening is achieved.

No antenna support structures, excluding disguised support structures, shall be located
within one-half (½) mile of another, preexisting antenna support structure, with the
distance being measured from the center of the base of the existing structure to the
center of the base of the proposed structure. Absent a determination by the Board of
Aldermen as provided in Subsections (E)(5)(b) or (E)(5)(c), antenna support structures,
except disguised support structures, shall not be located within five hundred (500) feet of
any residential structure, or any parcel of property used as a park, playground, school,
library, hospital, church, historic district, landmark, or an area on the National Register of
Historic Places.
The minimum setback from all adjoining property lines shall be that required for principal
structures in the applicable zoning district, plus one (1) additional foot for every one (1)
foot in height of the antenna support structure.
Height. Antenna support structures shall not exceed a height of seventy-two (72) feet in any
of the City's zoning districts, unless a different height is authorized because of the application
of Subsection (C)(9)(c) of this Section or because of a determination of the Board of
Aldermen pursuant to Subsection (E)(5)(b) or Subsection (E)(5)(c) hereof.
Co-use. Prior to the issuance of any conditional use permit the applicant shall:
Submit a notarized statement agreeing to make the proposed antenna support structure
available for use by others, subject to reasonable technical limitations and financial
terms.
Furnish an inventory of all known antenna support structures and potential building sites
located within one-half (½) mile of the proposed structure site, identifying the owner of
same as well as the antenna support structure's type and reference name or number, if
applicable, and the street location, latitude and longitude, height, type and mounting
height of existing antennas and an assessment of available space for the placement of
additional antennas, shelters and/or cabinets.
The applicant shall further demonstrate that he/she has requested co-use of each
existing building or antenna support structure from the owner thereof and/or shall indicate
why such co-use is inappropriate or was otherwise not allowed.
Antenna support structures may be constructed or modified so as to exceed the height
limitations provided in Subparagraph (8) hereof to accommodate co-use. An applicant
may request an extension of twenty (20) additional feet per co-user, whether actual or
anticipated, up to a limit of forty (40) additional feet. The City may also require the
applicant of new construction to exceed the applicable limitation, regardless of whether a
co-user is immediately available to share space with the applicant.
In the event that a conditional use permit is granted for the construction of a new antenna
support structure, the applicant shall notify in writing any other known potential service
providers in that area that the structure will be available for co-use. Said notices shall
issue on or before the day on which the applicant submits to the City an application for
building permit for the structure. The notice shall allow potential co-users thirty (30) days
within which to express any interest in co-use, during which time the applicant shall not
commit to a design for the structure which precludes co-use, and the City shall not issue
a building permit until such time has expired.
The willful and knowing failure of an applicant to agree to co-use or to negotiate in good
faith with potential co-users may be cause for either the denial of a pending application,
the revocation of an existing conditional use permit, and/or the withholding of future
similar permits to the applicant.
Site selection and control.
Sites in the City's non-residential districts are preferred. Sites in any residential district in
the City are prohibited absent a determination of necessity by the Board of Aldermen

pursuant to Subsection (E)(5)(c) of this Section. Within any zoning district, existing
antenna support structures and buildings are preferred, as are locations where the
existing topography, vegetation, buildings, or other structures provide the greatest
amount of screening.
Antennas and antenna support structures should be architecturally and visually (color,
bulk, size) compatible with surrounding existing buildings, structures, vegetation, and/or
uses in the area or those likely to exist under the regulations of the underlying zoning
district.
Antennas and antenna support structures should be located to minimize any adverse
effect they may have on neighboring property values.
Antennas and antenna support structures should be located to avoid a dominant
silhouette on ridge lines, and preservation of view corridors of surrounding residential
developments should be considered.
Any applicant for a conditional use or administrative permit under this Section shall be
required to demonstrate control over the site of the proposed antenna or antenna support
structure so as to establish the applicant's right and authority to install and/or construct
same on the property. An applicant's control can be demonstrated by proof of applicant
site ownership or the written permission of the property owner, whether by letter, license,
easement or lease agreement.
Building mounted antennas.
Antennas mounted on buildings should be made to appear as unobtrusive as possible.
Such antennas should be located as far away as feasible from the edge of the building
and should be painted a color consistent with the natural or built environment of the site.
Such antennas generally should not protrude more than twenty (20) feet from the top of
the structure absent either:
If the zoning district's height requirements are not violated in accordance with
Subsection (D)(1)(b) of this Section, a finding by the Director that the proposed
antenna poses no detrimental effect,
If the zoning district's height requirements are violated in accordance with
Subsection (D)(2)(c) of this Section, a determination by the Board of Aldermen as
provided in Subsections (E)(5)(b) or (E)(5)(c) of this Section.
Miscellaneous.
If a guyed tower is authorized by the Board of Aldermen pursuant to Subsections (E)(5)
(b) or (E)(5)(c) of this Section, its ground anchors shall be located on the same parcel as
the tower and such anchors shall meet the setbacks prescribed in Subsection (C)(7)
hereof.
Vehicle or outdoor storage on the site of any antenna support structure is prohibited.
On-site parking for periodic maintenance and service shall be provided at all locations of
antenna support structures.
Prior to the issuance of any conditional use permit the applicant shall demonstrate how
the proposed site fits into the applicant's overall telecommunications network in the St.
Louis County area.
Any antenna support structure no longer used for its original communications purpose
shall be removed at the owner's expense. The owner and applicable co-users shall
provide the City with a copy of any notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations and
shall have ninety (90) days from the date of ceasing operations to remove the antenna
support structure and any related facilities. In the case of co-use, this provision shall not

use for a period of one (1) year shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be removed
by the City at the owner's expense.
Prior to the issuance of an administrative or conditional use permit the City may require
indemnification and bonding as the City deems appropriate.
Administrative Permit. Administrative permits may be issued in accordance with the following
provisions.
Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted and do not require a conditional use permit.
The attachment of additional antennas to any antenna support structure existing on the

agencies which may be affected by the proposed facility, and in either case the
application shall not be deemed to be complete until such information is received.
The Director shall issue a decision on the permit within sixty (60) days of the date on
which the application is deemed complete and received by the Director or the application
shall be deemed approved. The Director may deny the application or approve the
application as submitted or with such modifications as are, in his/her judgment,
reasonably necessary to comply with the criteria and preferences established in
Subsection (C) hereof. A decision to deny an application shall be made in writing and
shall state the specific reasons for the denial.
Appeals from the decision of the Director shall be taken to the Board of Adjustment as
provided in Section 405.300 of this Chapter.
Conditional Use Permit.
Generally. Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed, processed, reviewed and
decided in the manner and time frame established for all other conditional use permits under
Sections 405.180 through 405.210, except as may be supplemented by this Section.
Applications. In addition to all other filing requirements, the application shall include such
information as is required or may otherwise be responsive to the criteria and preferences
established in Subsection (C) hereof.
Public hearing. The public hearing required by Section 405.200(D) for consideration of a
conditional use permit application shall be recorded, and all documentary evidence of any
kind submitted in support of or against the application shall be identified and labeled by the
City Clerk and made a part of the public record. The Board of Aldermen may exercise its
discretion to continue the public hearing for the purpose of accepting additional oral or
documentary evidence into the record for consideration.
Findings required. In addition to any other considerations required by either this Section or
Sections 405.180 through 405.210, before issuing a conditional use permit for any antenna

Whether the fees, costs, or other contractual terms required by an owner to lease, modify
or otherwise provide for co-use on an existing and suitable antenna support structure or
building are reasonable. Costs exceeding that of a new antenna support structure are
presumed unreasonable.
Whether there are other limiting conditions that render existing antenna support
structures or buildings within the applicant's required geographic area unsuitable.
Determination.
If the Board of Aldermen determines that, in light of the considerations noted in
Subsection (E)(4) of this Section, an application meets the criteria and preferences
established in Subsection (C) hereof and otherwise is in accordance with this Section,
the Board shall grant a conditional use permit, subject to whatever conditions the Board
deems appropriate.
The Board may determine that although an application does not meet the strict
requirements of the criteria and preferences established in Subsection (C) of this Section,
the general purpose and intent of said criteria and preferences are not offended because
of the particular circumstances presented. If such a determination is made, the Board
may vary the application of the criteria and preferences and grant a conditional use
permit, subject to whatever conditions the Board deems appropriate.
The Board may determine that in light of the considerations noted in Subsection (E)(4) of
this Section, the City's prescribed criteria and preferences effectively would preclude the
applicant's reception and/or transmission of signals and that the applicant's proposed
location and height are a matter of absolute engineering and economic necessity in order
to ensure the completion of the applicant's network. If such a determination is made, the
Board may grant a conditional use permit, subject to whatever conditions the Board
deems appropriate.
Any decision by the Board of Aldermen to deny a conditional use permit shall be in
writing, based upon the evidence adduced, and shall make specific findings of fact
consistent with the criteria, preferences and considerations established herein.
Appeal. Appeals from the Board's denial of a conditional use permit shall be taken to the
Circuit Court of St. Louis County or to any court or agency allowed by Federal law, specifically
the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Cost deposit. Any request or application for a determination under this Subsection shall be
accompanied by a cost deposit in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) to cover the
engineering, legal and other costs associated with the review and determination. Any
amounts not required by the City shall be refunded to the applicant. Any amounts required in
excess of the deposit shall be billed to and paid for by the applicant.

The purpose of the following regulations for the conditional use of satellite earth stations is to
improve the aesthetic appearance of these structures within all zoning districts and to ensure
installation of satellite earth stations which serves the public health, safety and welfare.
The regulations shall not impose unreasonable limitations on, or prevent reception of satellite
delivery signals by, receive-only antennas or impose costs on the users of such antennas that
are excessive in light of the purchase and installation cost of the equipment.
Satellite earth stations which are permitted in the underlying zoning district are exempt from
the regulations contained herein. Non-exempt satellite earth stations shall require a
conditional use permit as provided herein and in Sections 405.180 — 405.210.
Building Codes And Safety Standards.
All satellite earth stations shall meet or exceed the standards and regulations contained in
applicable State and local Building and Electrical Codes as well as the applicable standards
published by the Electronics Industries Association, as amended from time to time.
In no case shall satellite earth stations be permitted to be attached to a portable device. Any
satellite earth station must be stationary. The location of a satellite earth station shall be as
approved by the Planning Director on the site plan or plot plan of the property.
Aesthetic Standards.
No message or identification, other than the manufacturer's identification, shall be allowed to
be portrayed on a satellite earth station antenna. The message or identification shall not
excess .25 square feet in area. Satellite earth stations shall be limited to mesh construction;
however, a satellite earth station eight and one-half (8½) feet or less in diameter may be
either of mesh or solid construction. All dishes shall be finished in a single neutral, nonreflective
color and surface which shall blend with the natural surroundings.
Any ground-mounted satellite earth station shall be located in the rear yard, provided that on
a corner lot, the satellite earth station cannot be located any closer to the side street than the
principal building located on the lot. On any lot other than a corner lot, the satellite earth
station shall be placed in an area bounded by the side yard setback lines, the rear wall line of
the primary structure, and the rear yard setback line. The side and rear setback lines shall be
in accordance with the setback requirements of the underlying zoning district.
Ground-mounted satellite earth stations in non-residential districts shall be located in a
designated service area outside of any required landscape area or front and side yard
setback area. The satellite earth station shall not be placed in the area between the front
setback line and the structure.
Screening.
Screening of satellite earth stations shall serve to reduce the visual impact on adjoining
properties without impeding the "line of sight" of satellite earth station reception. The
location and type of screening shall be as approved by the Planning Director on the site
or plot plan.
Screening shall be accomplished through the use of fencing, landscaping in the form of
evergreen and deciduous trees, and shrubbery, structures or topography. For groundmounted
satellite earth stations in residential districts, trees and shrubs shall be at least
one-half (½) the height of the satellite earth station at the time of planting. (The center of
the satellite earth station shall be determined as the point where the satellite earth station
is attached to its base when viewed from off the site.) The landscaping material shall be
maintained and replaced as needed.
Screening of roof-mounted antenna in non-residential districts is required up to three (3)
feet, or to the center of the satellite earth station, whichever is greater. The design and

material composition of the screening shall be compatible with the existing building
design and colors and shall be approved by the Planning Director.
For residential zoning districts, the height of ground-mounted satellite earth stations shall not
exceed eight (8) feet above the average grade. All satellite earth stations in residential
districts, which are one (1) meter or greater in diameter, shall be ground mounted unless the
applicant can establish the applicability of Section 405.225 (A)(2). The satellite earth stations
shall not exceed a diameter of six (6) feet. Roof-mounted satellite earth stations in nonresidential
districts shall not exceed eight (8) feet in diameter or a total structure height of ten
(10) feet.
Section 405.226. Solar Energy Systems.
[Ord. No. 3759 §7, 8-26-2013]
Purpose. The purpose of the following regulations is to establish for the residents of the City of
Town and Country provisions for the use of solar energy systems as accessory uses within the
City of Town and Country. The City of Town and Country seeks to encourage alternate sources of
energy and to provide for the development, installation and construction of solar energy systems
subject to reasonable conditions that will protect the public health, safety and welfare, consistent
with the intent and purpose of Section 405.020 and Section 405.190.
Applicability.
This Section applies to ground-mounted solar energy systems and roof-mounted solar energy
systems that are mounted either on the front of the roof or on the side of the roof facing a
street, to be installed and constructed after the effective date of this Section, excepting for any
solar energy system that is no larger than 30 square feet in total solar collection area on any
lot. Roof-mounted solar energy systems that are flush-mounted on the rear of the roof, on the
side of the roof not facing on to a street, or on top of a flat roof and not visible from the ground
do not require conditional use permits.
Any upgrade, modification, or structural change that materially alters the size or placement of
an existing solar energy system shall comply with the provisions of this Section and all
applicable City ordinances.
Approval.
No permit for any new ground-mounted solar energy system and roof-mounted solar energy
system that is mounted either on the front of the roof, or on the side of the roof facing a street,
or on flat roofs on which the application can be seen from the ground shall be issued until
such time as the Board of Alderman shall approve a conditional use permit based on an
affirmative finding that the proposed solar energy system is in compliance with all standards
and requirements of this code, including the standards set forth in Section 500.110.
Applications for conditional use permits filed for solar energy systems shall be filed,
processed, reviewed and decided in the manner and time frame established for all other
conditional use permits under Sections 405.180 through 405.210.
In addition to all other filing requirements, the application for a conditional use permit for a
solar energy system shall include such information as is required or may otherwise be
responsive to the criteria and preferences established in this Section, including, but not limited
to, manufacturer's specifications, graphical elevations, photographs and other information as
necessary to describe the function and appearance of the proposed system when installed on
the property.

development plan together with a processing cost deposit which the Board shall
prescribe to the Commission for review and recommendation. The Commission shall
then evaluate the request for consistency in purpose and content with the nature of the
proposal as originally advertised for public hearing, and approved by the Board.
If the Commission determines that the proposed amendment to the final site
development plan is not significant, the Commission shall, within ninety (90) days after
receipt of said proposed amendment(s), submit a recommendation to the Board for
approval and/or modification. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Commission
recommendation, the Board shall accept or reject said recommendation and approve or
disapprove said amendment(s) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection
(4). If approved, the amended plan shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds within
thirty (30) days of approval.

development plan is significant, the Commission shall hold a new public hearing on the
matter in accordance with the proceedings specified in Subsection (2) prior to submitting
its recommendations to the Board for action in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Subsection (3). If approved, the amended plan shall be recorded with the Recorder of
Deeds within thirty (30) days of approval.
Guarantee of improvements. Unless otherwise provided for in the conditions of the ordinance
governing an approved development, no building permits, or permits authorizing the
occupancy or use of a building, facility, commercial establishment, or service concern shall be
issued until required related off-site improvements are constructed or escrow, or other
acceptable instrument approved as to form by the City Attorney, is posted guaranteeing the
improvements. Temporary building permits or other authorizations may be issued by the
Director to permit the completion of required related off-site improvements pursuant to this
Section. Required related off-site improvements may include, but not be limited to, streets,
sidewalks, sanitary and storm sewers, street lights, and street trees. If an approved
development is developed in sections, this requirement shall also apply to all major
improvements necessary to the proper operation and function of the section in question, even
though such improvements may be located outside of the section in question. The provisions
of the City's subdivision regulations respecting the installation or guarantee of subdivision
improvements and the inspections thereof together with the permits and fees required
therefor shall be applicable to the installation or guarantee of improvements under this
Section.
Trust indenture requirements. Whenever an applicant files an application for a site to be
developed and the site is to be subdivided into two (2) or more individual lots, the applicant
shall submit a proposed trust indenture as to all land within the site, which trust indenture
must comply with the requirements set forth in the subdivision regulations.

Section 405.300. Board of Adjustment.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(7007), 11-13-1989]
Board Established. The appointments to be the Board of Adjustment and its organization shall be
governed by the terms of the Municipal Code.
Rules Of Procedure. The Board of Adjustment may adopt from time to time such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary. Such rules and regulations shall be in writing and available
at the office of the City Clerk.
Vote Required. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board of Adjustment shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Director, or to

decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Chapter.
Powers. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
Review of orders, requirements, decisions or determinations of the Director. Any person or
any neighborhood organization as defined in Section 32.105, RSMo., representing such
person who is aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Director
or any administrative official in the enforcement of the Zoning Code alleged to be erroneous
may appeal to the Board of Adjustment. After a hearing in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter, the Board of Adjustment may reverse, affirm or modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from in accordance with the Zoning Enabling Act,
Sections 89.010 — 89.490, RSMo., (1986), as amended ("Enabling Act"), and the Zoning
Code, included in this Chapter.
Area variances. Area or non-use variances are deviations from permitted uses within a given
zoning district, for example bulk area, height, density, setbacks and sideline restrictions. The
Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant area or non-use variances from strict application of
the Zoning Code upon application or appeal in accordance with the Enabling Act, the Zoning
Code, and the procedures set forth herein, only upon a finding that:
The applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that strict application of the Zoning Code
would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship. There must be evidence of
unique circumstances or conditions such that, if the provisions of the Zoning Code were
strictly applied, the applicant would be deprived of reasonable use of the subject property
or structures. The circumstances or conditions must be peculiar to the subject property
and not generally prevalent in the neighborhood. Evidence that greater profit would result
if the variance were granted is not sufficient proof of practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship;
To grant an area or non-use variance would be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of the Zoning Code in the zoning district in which the subject property is located,
and would not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare; and
The deviation from strict application of the Zoning Code that would be authorized by the
area or a non-use variance would not constitute a change in the district map, impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, increase congestion in public
streets, increase the danger of fire, materially diminish or impair established property
values within the surrounding area, and would not in any other respect impair the public
health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare of the City.
Upon making the above findings, the Board of Adjustment is to grant the minimum
variance necessary to allow the applicant reasonable use of his/her land.
Use variances. Use variances permit a use of property other than one enumerated as a
permitted use in the Zoning Code for the particular zoning district in which that property is
located. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant use variances upon application or
appeal in accordance with the Enabling Act, the Zoning Code, and the procedures set forth
herein only upon finding that:
The applicant will be deprived of all beneficial use of the property under any of the
permitted uses in that zoning district. All beneficial use is lost only where the property is
not suitable for any use permitted in the Zoning Code for that zoning district;
The appellant has sufficiently demonstrated unnecessary hardship through actual proof
and not mere conclusory or lay opinion that the property in question cannot yield a
reasonable return if used only for a purpose or purposes permitted in the zoning district in
which that property is located;
The plight of the owner is due to exceptional or unique circumstances and not due to
general conditions in the neighborhood which may reflect the unreasonableness of the

Zoning Code itself;
The use to be authorized by the use variance would not alter the essential character of
the locality;
The proposed use to be authorized by the use variance would not constitute a change in
the district map, impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, increase
congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire, materially diminish or impair
established property values within the surrounding area, and would not in any other
respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the City.
Parking variances. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant variances from parking,
loading or unloading regulations in accordance with the Enabling Act, the Zoning Code, and
the procedures set forth herein, only upon finding that:
The use of the building or premises make unnecessary the full provision of parking or
lighting facilities; and
The requirements set forth herein for non-use variances are met.
Procedure for appeals to the Board of Adjustment.
Any person or any neighborhood organization as defined in Section 32.105, RSMo.,
aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Director or any
officer, department, board, or bureau of the City relating to the Zoning Code, may appeal
to the Board of Adjustment within sixty (60) days of the application of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. An application to appeal must be filed with the
Board of Adjustment specifying the grounds for appeal within sixty (60) days of the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from.
An appeal to the Board of Adjustment stays all proceedings in furtherance of the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Director appealed from, unless the Director
certifies in writing to the Board after the notice of appeal has been filed that, by reason of
facts specified in the certificate, a stay would in his/her opinion cause imminent peril to
life or property. Proceedings must be stayed by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Board, or by a court of record upon application and notice to the Director and on
good cause shown.
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals within a reasonable time period.
The Board of Adjustment shall give at least fifteen (15) days' public notice of its hearing
on each appeal in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The Board of
Adjustment shall also give due notice to interested parties, including the appellant and
persons owning property located within three hundred (300) feet of the property which is
the subject of the appeal. Any interested party may appear at the hearing of the Board of
Adjustment on an appeal in person or by attorney.
Meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such
other times as the Board may determine. The Chairman, or in his/her absence the Acting
Chairman, may administer oaths and compel attendance of witnesses. All meetings of
the Board of Adjustment shall be open to the public. The Board of Adjustment shall keep
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if
absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations
and other official actions, all of which shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk and shall
be a public record. All testimony, objections thereto, and rulings thereon, shall be taken
down by a reporter employed by the Board of Adjustment for that purpose. The Municipal
Code, including the Zoning Code, and the Comprehensive Plan and land use map which
is or may hereafter be in force, shall automatically be part of each hearing before the
Board of Adjustment to the extent applicable, without being specifically introduced at the
hearing.

Section 405.320. Bufferyard Standards.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(8200), 11-13-1989]
The "bufferyard" is a combination of setback and visual buffer or barrier between zoning districts.
A "bufferyard" consists of a unit of land together with the planting required thereon. Both the
amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified for each bufferyard requirement of
this Chapter are designed to eliminate or minimize conflicts between land uses and to insure a
desired character along public and private streets and roads. The planting units required of
bufferyards have been calculated to insure that they do, in fact, function as "buffers".
Bufferyards shall be required to separate different zoning districts from each other in order to
eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, noise, glare of lights, signs, building
bulk, parting areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of the above, or danger
from fires or explosions.
Where required by this Chapter bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of the lot
or site, extending to the lot or site boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on any
portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or right-of-way.
To determine the type of bufferyard required on a site or between a site and a street, the
following procedure shall be followed:
Identify whether any portion or lot line of the site constitutes a zoning district boundary. If
it does, determine the zoning on both sides of the lot or site.
Determine whether the land on the adjoining site is vacant or developed or whether a
subdivision plat of the adjoining site has been approved.
Classify any street adjacent to the proposed use as a local, minor, or major street.

Determine the bufferyard required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject
site by referring to the table of required bufferyards set forth for each zoning district.
Bufferyard credit. If a bufferyard screen, consisting of different plants than required below, is
already in place, the Planning and Zoning Commission may substitute the existing bufferyard
screen for the table of plant units required below.
The following table indicates the specifications of each bufferyard. Bufferyard requirements
are stated in terms of the width of the bufferyard and the number of plant units required per
one hundred fifty (150) linear feet of bufferyard.
A single "plant unit" for bufferyards shall consist of the total plantings designated in one

Each illustration depicts a typical one hundred fifty (150) foot bufferyard.
The exact placement of required plants and structures shall be the decision of each user
except that the following requirements shall be satisfied:
All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn, ground cover or prairie grass unless
a natural ground cover is already established.
Required plant materials for bufferyards shall be planted in the following sizes and
percentages.

Where the amount of frontage will require a fractional number of plants, the requirements
will be as follows: When the fraction is less than one-half (.5), the number required shall
be the amount of the next lowest whole number. When the fraction is one-half (.5) or
greater, the required amount will be the next largest whole number.
A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation. It may contain pedestrian, bike, or jogging
trails provided that:

The total width of the bufferyard is maintained, and
All other regulations of this Chapter are met.
In no event, however, shall any other structure be permitted in bufferyards,
except: Fences or walls as provided for in Article IV (Sections 405.130 —
405.150) of this Chapter; signs as provided for in Chapter 420 of this Title;
and driveway or street serving as access to a site or lot as approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, provided that the access does not
unreasonably encroach on the width of the bufferyard, and is not located
within seventy (70) feet of a street intersection or of another drive, and no
pavement serving as access be located closer than ten (10) feet to an
adjacent property line.
The property owner shall maintain the minimum bufferyard planting requirements of this
Chapter and replace as necessary to maintain the required plant units.

Commission, the Board of Aldermen may waive these requirements for a particular
drainageway after consideration of all relevant factors, and if the Board determines any of
the following findings, the waiver shall be denied:
Water runoff control structures in another location will not effectively reduce runoff
from the site at least as well as or better than the given drainageway, and have not
been designed to do so;
Removal of the drainageway will substantially and materially adversely affect the
visual coherence, appearance or development character of adjacent neighborhoods
and/or of the development site;

Tree Protection Measures.
Any construction, demolition, site work or similar activity which may injure existing trees which
are to be preserved shall require the installation of tree protection measures as set forth in
this Section or as otherwise determined by the City. The following tree protection measures
are to be followed and must be noted on the TPP:
All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to the commencement of demolition,
excavation, construction or site work.
A pre-construction meeting shall be held on-site to review the installed protection
measures with operators, construction supervisors, contractor's representatives, and the
City representative (if required by the City).
Development impact shall not enter the Critical Root Zone (CRZ) of trees to be
preserved. If this is not avoidable, the tree may have to be removed and tree restoration
requirements will be applied.
Tree protection fencing shall be installed along the edge of the Tree Protection Zone
(TPZ) of each preserved and impacted tree within the disturbed areas. Trees that share a
TPZ can be fenced together in a cluster. Tree protection fencing shall be installed along
hardscape edges that will remain intact. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
TPZ can be impacted.
The contractor on the site shall stake clearing limits in order to facilitate location for
trenching and fencing installation for tree protection.
The sequence of tree preservation measures, if required, shall be as follows: tree
protection fencing installation to establish the TPZ; root pruning trenching; tree pruning
and chemical treatment; and aeration systems.
Tree protection fencing shall be maintained and repaired by the contractor for the
duration of construction and approved by the City. No alteration shall occur without prior

harm to protected trees will not be allowed. Only limited access, if necessary, shall be
permitted with the prior approval of the City.
Removal of trees, shrubs, or undergrowth from protected areas shall only be performed
when necessary and must be done with hand/power tools only, no heavy
equipment/machinery.
Utility locations should be planned for areas outside of the (TPZ). Utilities that must cross
through the TPZ of trees due to site constraints and utility design requirements must be
approved by the City and will be directional bored. No open trenches are allowed. Tree
protection fencing must be maintained on both sides of the boring alignment.
Attachment of any construction signs, fencing, etc., to any tree to be saved is strictly
prohibited. Construction fence footings or support locations are required to be shown on
the plan. Position post locations to span the TPZ. Upon completion of construction, all
temporary barriers, fencing, and debris shall be removed from the site by the contractor.
Tree protection fencing shall consist of a green mesh safety fence that is a minimum of
three (3) feet in height, secured with heavy duty steel t-posts set a maximum of eight (8)
feet apart.
A moisture protected 8.5" x 11" sign stating, "Warning — Tree Protection Zone" shall be
required to be placed on the tree protection fencing at a minimum of twenty (20) foot
intervals, with a minimum of one (1) sign on each elevation of fence.
Tree Restoration And Escrow Requirement.
A tree restoration escrow deposit shall be submitted to the City prior to the issuance of any
permit related to the development of a site.
The dollar amount of the escrow deposit required shall be based on the total dollar value of all
trees to be preserved. The basis for the dollar value of a tree shall be derived from the most
recent edition of the Guide for Tree Appraisal as produced by the Council of Tree and
Landscape Appraisers.
Any trees that are intentionally or unintentionally removed or destroyed in violation of an
approved TPP shall be replanted and restored within six (6) months according to the
standards set forth in the Section.
If it is determined by the City Administrator or their designee that the protected trees have not
been replanted in a reasonable time, the City may cause the work to be performed and
deduct from the escrow deposit accordingly.
Prior to the full release of the escrow a report shall be submitted, in writing, from an
International Society of Arboriculture Certified Arborist or a Landscape Architect approved by
the City, verifying that the trees to be preserved are still alive.
The escrow deposit shall be returned upon approval, by the City Administrator or their
designee, of the submitted report and verification of the completion of any required tree
restoration.

Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway
of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such
parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of
vehicular access to a street in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements. No
driveway across public property, or requiring a curb cut, shall exceed a width of twenty-five
(25) feet.

location as specified by State and Federal regulations.
Reductions from minimum.
For development in any district, the Commission may recommend, and the Board of
Aldermen may approve, a total reduction of not more than thirty percent (30%) of the
required off-street parking and loading spaces actually installed where it has been
demonstrated by study of the combined uses and customary operation of the uses that
adequate parking would be provided.
When such a reduction is approved, an area of sufficient size to include the number of
parking and/or loading spaces necessary to meet the minimum requirements stated
herein shall be designated on the site development plan and no structure or paved
surface shall be permitted within such designated area. Such area shall not be included
in any required bufferyards. Such areas shall be reserved to accommodate additional
parking so as to meet the otherwise applicable minimum requirements in the event a
conversion shall be required when the Board of Aldermen shall so determine. In the
event of such determinations, the additional parking shall be constructed within four (4)
months thereafter or within such time determined appropriate by the Board.
Off-Street Loading Design Standards.
The minimum area for each off-street loading space, excluding area for maneuvering, shall be
four hundred eighty (480) square feet.
At no time shall any part of a truck or van be allowed to extend into the right-of-way of a public
thoroughfare while the truck or van is being loaded or unloaded.
Road Standards.
Design and construction of all new streets shall be in accordance with the street specifications
prescribed in Chapter 410, Subdivision Regulations.
Clear view of intersecting streets.
In order to provide a clear view of intersecting streets to the motorist, there shall be a
triangular area of clear vision formed by the two (2) intersecting streets.
On any portion of a lot that lies within the triangular area described below, nothing shall
be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to impede
vision between a height of two and one-half (2½) feet and ten (10) feet above the grade
at the two (2) street centerlines.
The triangular area shall be formed by a point on the boundary line of each street rightof-
way located twenty (20) feet from the near edge of the intersection of the streets.

Qualifying churches. The Planning and Zoning Commission has discretion to recommend to
the Board of Aldermen modification of the green space and FAP requirements as provided in
Subsection (2) below with respect to individual church lots in the "SE" and "E" Zoning
Districts, upon making the following findings.
The church lot is adjacent to one (1) or more non-residential uses, excluding two (2) or
four (4) lane streets. Interstate highways shall be considered a non-residential use.
The proposed reduction of green space and/or increase in FAP would not adversely
affect surrounding residential areas or be otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
The proposed reduction of green space and/or increase in FAP would not substantially
increase the volume of traffic.
The proposed reduction of green space and/or increase in FAP would not have an
adverse aesthetic effect.
Performance standards for qualifying churches. Where the Planning and Zoning Commission
makes the findings set forth in Subsection (1) above and with approval of the Board of
Aldermen:
The required green space for qualifying church lots may be reduced from seventy-five
percent (75%) to no less than sixty percent (60%); and/or
The maximum allowed floor area percentage (FAP) may be increased to no greater than
sixteen percent (16%).
Article X. Suburban Low and Suburban Medium Residential
District Regulations
Section 405.455. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(10000), 11-13-1989]
Because of major roadways within the City residential developments along corridor locations
require additional buffering and landscaping. Therefore, smaller lot sizes and a greater range of
dwelling unit types are provided in the Suburban Low "SL" and the Suburban Medium "SM"
Districts. The higher density development provided for in these two (2) districts is restricted to
tracts of land in corridor locations only.
The Suburban Low District is intended to provide low density development in corridor locations
only. It provides for a greater range of dwelling unit types and for more flexible types of design in
order to permit residential development of a low intensity near major roads.
The Suburban Medium District is intended to provide for moderate density residential development
in corridor locations only. Development standards recognize the need to insure adequate buffering
and landscaping with the opportunity to select the dwelling unit type most suitable to the
constraints of the site.
Section 405.460. Frontage Requirements.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(10100), 11-13-1989]
All lots must front on a street with a minimum fifty (50) foot right-of-way and a minimum twenty (20) foot
pavement width and connect with a street with the same minimum design standards.

The Campus Office "CO" District is intended to permit one (1) story low intensity office
development in a manner that enhances the suburban character of the City. The "CO" District is to
be used in areas where the dominant adjacent land use is residential but where the
Comprehensive Plan calls for low intensity non-residential uses of a clearly suburban character
which blends in with the surrounding residential areas.
The Office "O" District is intended for the most intensely developed areas of the Route 40 Corridor.
It is to be limited to the western and northern portions of the corridor and office buildings
previously constructed elsewhere in the City. It permits office and related development in these
areas at intensities that will preserve the suburban character and limit adverse impacts on the
local and regional traffic network.
The purpose of this Chapter is to indicate which land uses may be located in these two (2) districts
and which uses may not be located therein. A further distinction is made between uses which are
permitted only upon obtaining a conditional use permit.

[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(14000), 11-13-1989]
The purpose of the planned residential community (PRC) regulations is to allow deviation from
certain zoning performance standards for residential developments in the Suburban Low "SL" and
Suburban Medium "SM" Residential Zoning Districts under conditions that allow for development
of high quality residential uses in locations where there are possible conflicts with adjoining uses
or with natural resources or other site conditions. However, under no circumstances shall the
standards for a development relating to density, permanent open space or green space per gross
buildable site area be relaxed.
Planned residential community regulations provide the City with flexibility in consideration of
residential uses and enable it to adjust development regulations to particular site conditions.
Planned residential communities may be developed only in accordance with approved site plans
and conditions enumerated in ordinances for particular planned residential community
developments.
A planned residential community should attempt to incorporate the following design criteria:
[Ord. No. 4393, 11-9-2020[1]]
Incorporate landscaped buffers from main roads and adjacent residential uses.
Include shared common ground.
Offer front/side side entry garage access and avoid the use of open parking and carports.
Use high-quality architectural features such as high-pitched roofs. natural exterior materials
and avoid the use of non-natural materials such as vinyl or plastic components, synthetic or
faux stone and brick and other imitation materials.
Use less-restrictive lot sizes with large greenspaces.
Connect to a trail system. if feasible.

Article XVI. Planned Office Park District Regulations
Section 405.910. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(16000), 11-13-1989]
The Planned Office Park District is intended to facilitate the development of high quality office
uses in locations where, because of possible conflicts with adjoining uses or with natural
resources or conditions on the site, more development control and flexibility than that afforded in
other office districts is necessary. Planned office parks may be developed only in accordance with
approved site plans and conditions enumerated in specific ordinances for each respective planned
office park development. Planned office parks are to provide the City flexibility in consideration of
office uses and to enable the City to adjust development regulations to particular site conditions.
Although the standards of the office districts may be relevant to planned office parks, more
development control and flexibility may be necessary to protect the general welfare than is
possible under either the campus office or office regulations. In an ordinance creating or approving
1/3/22, 10:49 PM City of Town And Country, MO Ecode360

C.
particular planned office parks, the Board of Aldermen shall impose those conditions and
restrictions consistent with the characteristics of that particular development and its surrounding
area in accordance with good planning considerations.
Planned office parks shall be located such that no significant amount of non-residential traffic will
flow through any residential district.
Section 405.920. Application of Other Provisions of This Zoning
Ordinance.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(16005), 11-13-1989]
The regulations in Article XVI (Sections 405.910 — 405.990) of this Chapter are supplemented by
additional general regulation in other Chapters of this Zoning Code. Where there is a conflict between
regulations in or authorized by this Chapter and provisions in other chapters of this Zoning Code, the
regulations in or authorized by this Chapter govern the Planned Office Park District.
Section 405.930. Supplemental Definitions.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(16010), 11-13-1989; Ord. No. 3491 §1, 1-12-
2010]
The following definitions supplement those set forth in Section 405.080, and apply to this Chapter only.
DEVELOPMENT
One (1) contiguous area occupied by or developed for one (1) or more of the uses permitted by
ordinances approving particular planned office parks and under single ownership or, alternatively,
under single management control by one (1) Board of Trustees pursuant to a single trust indenture
in compliance with Section 405.990 herein. When a street would run through a proposed planned
office park development so as to divide an otherwise contiguous area, the Board of Aldermen
may, after a recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission deem the proposed area to
constitute one (1) development if it finds it would enhance the project and would not be detrimental
to the general welfare.
DORMITORY
A structure whose principal use is for the housing of students, faculty and guests and is directly
related to a "major educational use" as defined in Section 405.695.
OFFICE
A building or portion of a building wherein services are performed involving predominantly
administrative, professional, or clerical operations.
OFFICE USES
Office uses include business or professional offices, medical offices or clinics, and all other
customary office uses.
PERMITTED INCIDENTAL USES
Uses which are dependent on, incidental to, or affiliated with one (1) or more permitted uses within
the Planned Office Park District, and which are designated as permitted, accessory or conditional
uses in the Office or Campus Office Districts in Article XI (Sections 405.550 — 405.610) of this
Chapter.
PUBLIC GARAGE
A shelter or storage structure for automotive vehicles, which provides parking or storage facilities
in excess of that required for and not associated with approved uses for the lot or development on
which it is located.

SPECIAL ANCILLARY USES
Uses occupying floor area within an office structure in planned office parks, which uses are not
designated as permitted, accessory or conditional uses in the Office or Campus Office Districts in
Article XI (Sections 405.550 — 405.610) of this Chapter, and which uses are intended primarily to
serve the tenants of the permitted office uses.
Section 405.935. Procedure For Establishment of A Planned
Office Park.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(16015), 11-13-1989]
A planned office park may be established on one (1) development in single ownership or
management control, provided that:
An application for a change in zoning, if required, is approved by the Board of Aldermen after
a report from the Planning and Zoning Commission;
A preliminary site development plan is approved by the Board of Aldermen after a report from
the Planning and Zoning Commission; and
A final site development plan is approved by the Board of Aldermen and recorded in the office
of the St. Louis County Recorder of Deeds in compliance with this Chapter and the enabling
ordinances for the particular planned office parks.
In annexed areas where plans were approved by St. Louis County prior to annexation, which
plans do not comply with bufferyard, landscaping, off-street parking, loading, lot area, green
space, natural resource protection, or other standards for the POP District, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may review and the Board of Aldermen may approve such plans in place
of the preliminary site development plan and final site development plan otherwise required
herein, upon finding that:
Requiring compliance with such standards would result in practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardship; and
The plans as approved by St. Louis County would not adversely affect surrounding
property or impair the public welfare.
Failure to comply with the time limits for presentation of a final site development plan or with the
schedule for construction in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter and the specific
ordinances for particular planned office parks may, in the discretion of the Board of Aldermen,
result in revocation of the ordinances.

District may be initiated by either the owner of the subject property or its agent or the City, in
accordance with the requirements for rezoning set forth in Section 405.290 of this Zoning Code.
Petition by the owner or his/her agent.
Petitions for rezoning by the owner of the subject property or its agent must be
accompanied by a preliminary site development plan reflecting the proposed use(s) of
the property, in accordance with Section 405.945 herein. The Planning and Zoning

Commission may recommend and the Board of Aldermen may enact by ordinance a
zoning district classification other than that requested in a petition for rezoning.
In annexed areas, in lieu of said preliminary site development plan, the applicant may
submit plans for the subject property, which plans were approved by St. Louis County
prior to annexations, but which do not comply with either the requirements of Section
405.945 or standards for the POP District.
Motion by the City. A Planned Office Park District may be established by ordinance of the
Board of Aldermen in accordance with Section 405.290 of this Zoning Code, when the Board
determines that particular tracts or areas should be developed for office uses, but because of
possible conflicts with adjoining uses, more flexibility and/or development control is necessary
to protect the general welfare than is possible under the regulations of other zoning districts.
Referral, Report And Public Hearing On Requests For Rezoning. As required in Article VII, Section
405.290 of this Zoning Code, any proposed change in the boundaries of zoning districts shall first
be referred or submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its recommendations and
report. After the Commission submits its report to the Board, the Board shall hold a duly publicized
public hearing in accordance with Article VII, Section 405.290 of this Chapter.
Section 405.945. Site Development Plan For Planned Office
Parks.
[Ord. No. 1076 §§1 — 7, 1-27-1987; Ord. No. 1345 §1(16022), 11-13-1989]
Unless otherwise provided herein, Article VII, Section 405.260 of this Chapter governs site plan
review and architectural review.

elevation views).
A preliminary site development plan shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission in
accordance with Article VII, Section 405.260 of this Chapter, taking into consideration all general
planning considerations, including consistency with good planning practice and compatibility with
adjoining community developments and uses, particularly residential uses. At any time, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may require that the owner or its agent who has submitted an
application for a planned office park submit a revised preliminary site development plan affecting
any or all of the conditions that the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend to the
Board of Aldermen. Such a revised preliminary site development plan must be presented within

At any time after the Planning and Zoning Commission has submitted its recommendations and
report to the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Aldermen may require that the owner or its agent
who has submitted an application for a planned office park submit a revised preliminary site
development plan reflecting any or all of the conditions that the Planning and Zoning Commission
has recommended or the Board of Aldermen may impose in an ordinance authorizing that planned
office park. Such a revised preliminary site development plan must be presented within six (6)
months of the date the request therefor is made by the Board of Aldermen, or the application shall
be deemed withdrawn. This six (6) month period may be lengthened by the Board of Aldermen.
The Board of Aldermen, after receiving the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, may accept, reject, or modify those recommendations in accordance with provisions
set forth in Article VII (Sections 405.230 — 405.300) of this Chapter, except that, unless expressly
required by the Board, architectural review required by Section 405.260(5) need not occur
simultaneously with consideration by the Board of the preliminary site development plan. Any
ordinance approving a preliminary site development plan for a planned office park shall direct the
applicant to prepare a final site development plan reflecting the regulations and conditions
imposed by the Board.
A final site development plan must be presented to the Board of Aldermen within twelve (12)
months of the date of the ordinance approving the preliminary site development plan. Upon
application, the Board of Aldermen may, in its discretion, extend the twelve (12) month period for
filing a final site development plan. In no event shall the Board extend the twelve (12) month
period to more than thirty-six (36) months. Failure to submit a final site development plan which
reflects compliance with the conditions contained in the ordinance approving the preliminary site
development plan within the time prescribed herein shall be deemed a withdrawal of the
application for site plan review.
After review of the final site development plan by staff, the Board of Aldermen shall review and
may approve by ordinance a final site development plan and trust indenture. The Board of
Aldermen shall make an architectural review of a proposed planned office park simultaneously
with consideration by the Board of the final site development plan in accordance with the
standards set forth in Section 405.260(5).
Site improvement permits may be issued, in the discretion of and under conditions imposed by the
Director, after approval of a preliminary site development plan for particular planned office parks.
No building permits shall be issued, and no structural construction shall commence, in existing or
proposed planned office parks, until the final site development plan is approved by the Board of
Aldermen and recorded in the office of the St. Louis County Recorder of Deeds in compliance with
the Zoning Code.
Section 405.950. Permitted Uses.

office parks, and which are designated as permitted, accessory or conditional uses in the Office or
Campus Office Districts in Article XI (Sections 405.550 — 405.610) of this Chapter, are permitted
incidental uses in the Planned Office Park District. In addition, in the discretion of the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the Board of Aldermen, the ordinances for particular planned office parks
may authorize parking structures which serve other permitted uses within particular planned office
parks. Public garages are not a permitted use or a permitted incidental use.
Special Ancillary Uses. Special ancillary uses, as defined in Section 405.930 herein, may be

Election. A trust indenture shall provide for election of the Board of Trustees consisting of
at least three (3) members elected from among the owners and lessees of building space
or duly authorized representatives of owners and lessees of building space within a
planned office park. The process for election of trustees by owners and lessees of
building space within a planned office park shall be equitable and shall be defined in the
trust indenture. Each trustee shall serve an initial term of no less than one (1) nor more
than three (3) years. If authorized by trust indenture, trustees may serve successive
terms.
Powers. The Board of Trustees shall be charged with the duty under this Chapter and
under such trust indenture to maintain all streets, common areas and any other areas or
structures for the common use of the tenants or owners of property. The Board of

in compliance with the ordinances of the City of Town and Country and in such manner
that such areas and structures will remain attractive and useful to the owners and tenants
of the property within such site and shall not be injurious to the health, safety and welfare
of residents of surrounding areas or be detrimental to property values of land and
improvements within the site or in surrounding areas. The Board of Trustees shall have
the right, power, and responsibility to enforce the provisions of the trust indenture and the
ordinances pertaining to that planned office park. Action by the Board of Trustees shall
be made by majority vote. The Board of Trustees shall have the power to authorize

trustees by the trust indenture to comply with the provisions of this Chapter may be
abrogated.
Interim trustees. If a trustee ceases to be an owner of a lot or duly authorized
representative of an owner of a lot in the planned office park, resigns, or becomes
otherwise unavailable to act as a trustee, the owner shall elect an interim trustee to serve
for the remainder of that trustee's term within thirty (30) days. If the owners fail to elect an
interim trustee within thirty (30) days, the remaining trustees shall appoint an interim
trustee to serve the trustee's term.
Special assessments for stormwater control easements. In addition to the annual
assessments authorized for the above purposes, the trustees shall make an annual special
assessment in a sum prescribed by the ordinances for particular planned office parks for the
purpose of repairing, operating, maintaining and establishing appropriate reserves for
repairing, operating and maintaining the stormwater control easements, including all

facility to the Board of Aldermen with the recommendation of approval. Such a revised preliminary
site development plan must be presented within six (6) months of the date the request therefor is
made by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or the application shall be deemed withdrawn.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may lengthen this six (6) month period.
After the Planning and Zoning Commission has reviewed a preliminary site development plan, it
shall submit its recommendations and report to the Board of Aldermen in accordance with Section
405.260 of this Zoning Code.
At any time after the Planning and Zoning Commission has submitted its recommendations and

who has submitted an application for a nursing home, assisted living or continuum of care facility
submit a revised preliminary site development plan reflecting any or all of the conditions that the
Planning and Zoning Commission has recommended or the Board of Aldermen may impose in an
ordinance authorizing the nursing home, assisted living or continuum of care facility. Such a
revised preliminary site development plan must be presented within six (6) months of the date the
request therefor is made by the Board of Aldermen, or the application shall be deemed withdrawn.
This six (6) month period may be lengthened by the Board of Aldermen.

months of the date of the ordinance approving the preliminary site development plan. Upon
application, the Board of Aldermen may, in its discretion, extend the twelve (12) month period to
no more than thirty-six (36) months. Failure to submit a final site development plan which reflects
compliance with the conditions contained in the ordinance approving the preliminary site
development plan within the time prescribed herein shall be deemed a withdrawal of the
application or site plan review.
The final site development plan shall be reviewed by the Director of Planning to determine
whether it complies with the ordinances approving the preliminary site development plan. Upon
finding compliance, the Director of Planning shall note that finding and the date thereof upon the
final site development plan. The developer shall record the final site development plan and the
ordinance approving the preliminary site development plan with the St. Louis County Recorder of
Deeds within sixty (60) days of the date that the finding is noted on the final site development plan,
and furnish a copy of the recorded documents to the Director of Planning.

The Park Zoning District is intended to preserve certain areas that have been judged viable for
permanent preservation, while at the same time establishing other areas for recreational use. The
City recognizes the very important role recreation and open space play in the provision of a
healthy community and, to that end, the permitted and conditional uses provided in the park
district are limited to those activities which support or are related to the preservation of open space
and recreational lands. In order to preserve the character of our community these areas should be
treated as finite, irreplaceable resources with both public and private value.
The purpose of this district is to maintain and preserve those areas that are designated and
developed for recreational purposes. Only a limited number of recreational uses are permitted as
a matter of right, with all other proposed recreational uses and structures requiring approval
through the permit process. Approval of any proposed recreational uses and structures is directly
dependent upon their compatibility with the surrounding community.
Nothing contained in this Article shall prohibit the City from entering into an agreement with an
educational institution(s) for the joint use of any park facilities.

uses in locations where there are possible conflicts with adjoining uses or with natural resources
or other site conditions.
Planned mixed use development regulations provide the City with flexibility in consideration of
residential uses with commercial uses and enable it to adjust development regulations to particular
site conditions. Planned mixed use developments may be developed only in accordance with
approved site plans and conditions enumerated in ordinances for particular planned mixed
developments.
Unless specifically provided herein, the regulations and performance standards pertaining to the
"C" District apply for all non-residential uses in a planned mixed use development.

Article XXI. Service Revitalization Development
Section 405.1400. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 3907 §1, 6-22-2015]
The purpose of the service revitalization "SR" regulations are to encourage development of small
non-residentially zoned parcels (less than one (1) acre) by allowing for a greater variety of uses
and building types than would normally be permitted and allow greater flexibility in site planning,
so as to promote service oriented growth within specified locations. It is intended that service
revitalization developments should be well integrated in terms of land use, functional systems, and
major design elements such as architecture, access and infrastructure. Design standards should
be supportive of a cohesive development while accentuating the sense of community.
Service revitalization development regulations provide the City with flexibility in consideration of
service oriented uses and enable it to adjust development regulations to particular site conditions.
Service revitalization developments may be developed only in accordance with approved site
plans and conditions enumerated in ordinances for particular developments.
Unless specifically provided herein, the regulations and performance standards pertaining to the
Campus Office "CO" Zoning District apply for all uses in the service revitalization developments.
Interpretation. The following standards are intended to supplement those set forth in Article VIII
and Article XI of this Chapter. Only where particular specifications are set forth herein do those
specifications override those set forth in Article VIII and Article XI of this Chapter.

[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017]
An Overlay District is a "transparent" zoning district that lies over an existing zoning district and is used
to implement additional development standards or place restrictions beyond those required by the
existing or base zoning district. The Overlay District generally outlines uniform standards within the
established boundary to ensure a higher quality of development.

[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017]
The purpose of creating an Overlay District (OD) is to set and coordinate special development
standards to a specific area that has unique value to the City and its residents, such as a business
district or transportation corridor, and that are designed to provide a distinctive character and
atmosphere to the designated area. Overlay Districts are appropriate instruments to implement the
long-term goals and objectives of the adopted Comprehensive Plan and are primarily intended to be
used when special circumstances justify the modification of base or existing zoning district regulations
to achieve those specific design objectives that do not coincide with base zoning districts.
Section 405.1610. Establishment And Designation.
[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017]
Overlay Districts shall be established through the rezoning process as outlined in Section 405.290
and only in conjunction with existing, base zoning districts.
An Overlay District may cover parts of several zoning districts or only a portion of an existing or
base zoning district.
The existing or base zoning district shall maintain standard permitted land uses and development
regulations. The Overlay District may further restrict development standards and/or land uses
suitable to the purpose and protection of the Overlay District.
Development standards that may be regulated in an Overlay District are: lot size, building
height and area, architectural design and materials, accessory buildings and structures,
landscaping and buffer yards, parking, lighting, signage, development review procedures or
any other restrictions that meet the Overlay District's purpose.
Land uses shall be specifically delineated for each application.
When an Overlay District is established, any subsequent application to change the existing or
base zoning district shall not be construed to be an application to eliminate the Overlay District for
the property covered by the application. Any intent to eliminate the Overlay District on a given
property shall be expressly stated to be part of the application.
In cases where there is a conflict between the requirements of the Overlay District and the
underlying existing or base zoning district, the Overlay District restrictions shall apply.
When an applicant seeks to vary from the requirements of an Overlay District, they shall apply to
the Board of Adjustment for a variance just as they would if they were varying from the
requirements of the base or existing zoning district.
Section 405.1615. Relationship Of Overlay Districts To Zoning
Map.
[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017]
Overlay Districts are adopted in the same manner as any other zoning amendment. When an Overlay
District and its associated regulations are adopted, the zoning map shall be amended to establish the
boundaries for the Overlay District.
Section 405.1620. through Section 405.1699. Adopted Overlay
Districts.
[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017]
These Sections have been left reserved for future Overlay District Regulations.

Section 405.1700. Planned Development Districts.
[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017]
A Planned Development Zoning District is a zoning district that provides for one (1) or more properties
to be developed under a plan that provides for better coordinated development that incorporates
development standards crafted to respond to site conditions.
Section 405.1705. Purpose — Planned Development District.
[Ord. No. 4085 § 1, 5-8-2017; Ord. No. 4393, 11-9-2020]
The purpose of a planned development (PD) district is to permit flexibility and encourage a more
creative and efficient development of a tract of land not possible with an existing zoning district,
while maintaining maximum control by the City over both the structure and future operation of the
development.
The use of a planned development district is not intended to allow significant reductions in
conventional zoning regulations, or the development of incompatible land uses, within the
development or as the development relates to the surrounding neighborhood.
The City may, upon proper application, approve a planned development district in order to achieve
the following objectives for the benefit of the public:
Facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the adopted Comprehensive Plan,
where applicable.
Preserve and enhance the natural resources, such as grand trees, open space, woodlands, in
the development of the property that is of a higher quality than is possible under the
regulations otherwise applicable to the property.
Promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities resulting in
quality design and development, including aesthetic and public amenities, such as enhanced
public parks and trails, below-grade parking facilities, and architectural/historically significant
building preservation.
Promote a combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms and building
relationships within a single development project and, if necessary, covering different phases.
Provide economic development benefits and not overtax public services.
Encourage efficient and effective vehicular and pedestrian circulation, both within and
adjacent to the development site.
Provide public benefits that could not be derived from a development that strictly adheres to
the underlying zoning district.
Section 405.1710. Types Of Planned Development Districts.
[Ord. No. 4393, 11-9-2020[1]]
There shall be two (2) types of planned development districts. Each district shall be subject to the
specific restrictions and limitations outlined in this Section. These districts are the Planned Non-
Residential District (PNRD) and the Planned Senior Living District (PSLD). A planned
development that is primarily residential shall adhere to the regulations established by Article XIV,
Planned Residential Community (PRC) Regulations.

Planned Non-Residential Development (PNRD). A PNRD allows for flexibility from certain zoning
performance standards under conditions that allow for development of a combination of nonresidential
uses and, under specific circumstances, residential uses, in a manner that promotes
the objectives of Section 405.1705(C).
Requirements And Restrictions. The following requirements and restrictions shall apply to all
PNRD applications:
Location. A PNRD shall be located exclusively on a property designated as Commercial,
Office, Campus Office, or Planned Office Park Zoning.
Permitted Uses And Specific Prohibitions. A PNRD shall be limited to non-residential
uses such as general retail, office, personal services, medical, and institutional uses. A
PNRD shall include more than one (1) non-residential use. Senior living uses, such as a
skilled-nursing facility, residential-care facility, assisted-living facility and independent
living (continuum-of-care facility), shall only be eligible for a Planned Senior Living
Development (PSLD) and not a PNRD.
Residential Exception. The Board of Aldermen may approve owner-occupied residential
in combination with complementary non-residential uses within a PNRD if planned
development is located on property that meets each and every of the following
conditions:
The subject property is adjacent to residentially zoned property on at least one side.
The subject property is adjacent to commercially zoned property on at least one
side.
The subject property is adjacent to a major highway or interstate.
Performance Standards. Consistent with the PNRD regulations, the Board of Aldermen
may approve deviations from performance standards for particular uses within that
development in order to achieve the objectives set forth in Section 405.1705(C), unless
provided otherwise herein.
Permanent Open Space And Natural Resources. All land required to be protected by
Section 405.335 of this Chapter shall be preserved as permanent open space, and this
permanent open space requirement shall not be varied in the ordinances for a particular
PNRD development.
Greenspace. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the gross buildable site area of each
PNRD shall be devoted to green space.
Single-Family Residential Adjacency. Where adjoining property is zoned single-family
residential, the following performance standards shall apply:
A minimum setback of fifty (50) feet per building story.
A maximum height of two (2) stories, up to forty (40) feet.
A minimum "E" bufferyard as defined by Section 405.320.
Planned Senior Living Development (PSLD). A PSLD allows for flexibility from certain zoning
performance standards under conditions that allow for development of high-quality senior living
uses in locations where they would be complementary with adjoining uses and allow for a better
site design and preservation of natural resources and open space.
Requirements And Restrictions. The following requirements and restrictions shall apply to all
PSLD applications:
Location. A PSLD shall be located exclusively on a property designated as Office,
Campus Office, or Planned Office Park Zoning.

facility, residential-care facility, assisted-living facility and independent living. Independent
living shall be permitted only in association with a continuum-of-care facility that also
includes skilled nursing and/or assisted living. These permitted uses are only eligible for
a Planned Senior Living Development (PSLD) and not a PNRD.
Performance Standards. Consistent with the PSLD regulations, the Board of Aldermen
may approve deviations from performance standards for particular uses within that
development in order to achieve the objectives set forth in Section 405.1705(C), unless
provided otherwise herein.

Section 410.040. Application.
[Ord. No. 1346 §1(21.01-D), 11-13-1989]
For the purpose of this Chapter a subdivision of land is either or both:
Division or redivision of land into two (2) or more lots or other divisions of land, or
The dedication or establishment of a street through a tract of land regardless of area.
No portion of a proposed subdivision shall include land located outside the corporate limits of the
City.
No land shall be divided within the corporate limits of the City until:
Subdivider or the subdivider's agent has submitted a preliminary plat, site plan, improvement
plans and a record plat in accordance with the City's requirements, procedures and the
standards established herein for review and appropriate action by the department responsible
for the development of land, the Planning and Zoning Commission, and the Board of
Aldermen;
Appropriate approvals of the preliminary plat, improvement plans and record plat are obtained
in accordance with the procedures of this Chapter; and
The approved record plat is filed with the St. Louis County Recorder of Deeds. In the event a
record plat which has not been duly approved and fully executed is recorded it shall be
considered invalid and the City shall institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the
records of the County.
No significant changes, erasures, modifications or revisions, as determined by the department,
shall be made on a record plat of a subdivision after final approval has been given and endorsed
in writing on the plat, unless the plat is first resubmitted and reapproved in accordance with the
procedures established herein. Revisions such as minor adjustments of easements or minor
mathematical corrections may be made with the approval of the designated City authority.
The division of land involving the sale or transfer of parcels of land to or between adjoining
property owners, where such sale or transfer does not create an additional lot nor reduce the
original lot or lots below the zoning requirements of the applicable district or districts, is considered
a boundary line adjustment and is exempt from the subdivision requirements; provided however,
that prior to such sale or transfer a plat of the subdivision is submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission staff for their review and recommendation, whereupon, the Planning and Zoning
Commission staff shall forward the plat along with said recommendation to the Board of Aldermen
for the Board's consideration and for the adoption of an ordinance approving the "boundary
adjustment plat", should the Board of Aldermen so determine. If the Board of Aldermen deems
that further investigation or inquiry is required, the Board may refer consideration of the boundary
adjustment and plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission for their review and recommendation
prior to making a determination. Such division of land, so approved, shall be recorded with the title
of the property in the office of the St. Louis County Recorder of Deeds.
Section 410.050. Resubdivision of Land.
[Ord. No. 1346 §1(21.01-E), 11-13-1989]
Procedure For Resubdivision. Any changes in a recorded plat deemed by the department to be
significant, including but not limited to changes in lot lines, street layout, areas reserved for
common ground or public use, excluding those minor adjustments identified in the preceding
Section 410.040(D) shall be reviewed and approved by the same procedure, rules, and
regulations as for land subdivision.

Procedure For Subdivision Where Further Subdivision Is Possible. Whenever a parcel of land is
subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one (1) or more lots have the potential for additional
subdivision under the provisions herein, the Commission may recommend and the Board of
Aldermen may require that such parcel of land provide for the future opening of streets, water and
sewer and other utility lines, or the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and/or extension of such streets, water and sewer and other utility lines may be
made a condition of record plat approval.
Section 410.060. Vacation of Record Plats.
[Ord. No. 1346 §1(21.01-F), 11-13-1989]
The City or the owner or owners of the total area of a subdivision plat may initiate action to vacate
a record plat in part or total by submitting a written instrument including a copy of the original plat
and a map identifying the proposed configuration of the platted area to the Commission for review.
The instrument shall include as attachments, documents from utility companies with easements
and/or rights-of-way within the subject area granting permission for the vacation of existing
easements and/or rights-of-way. The City may reject any such instrument which abridges or
destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements or streets.
Such instrument shall be executed, approved, and recorded in a like manner as record plats of
subdivisions; being duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, and public grounds,
and all dedications laid out or described in such plat.
If an indenture of restrictions has been filed with a record plat, before the record plat or any portion
thereof may be vacated, the indenture of restrictions shall be amended in accordance with the
amendment procedure contained in said indenture to exclude all or any portion of the land
covered by the indenture of restrictions.
Section 410.070. Variances.
[Ord. No. 1346 §1(21.01-G), 11-13-1989]
General. When a subdivider believes the regulations and standards provided herein create an
undue hardship on the subdivision of land, the subdivider may petition for a variance as follows: If
the regulation or standard is also a zoning regulation or standard, the subdivider may petition the
Board of Adjustment for the variance; if the regulation or standard is a non-zoning regulation or
standard, then the subdivider may petition the Board of Aldermen for the variance. The
Commission shall review and report on the requested variance prior to the hearing by the Board of
Aldermen. The Board of Aldermen shall, in addition, give fifteen (15) days' notice by first class mail
to the subdivider and all property owners as shown on the tax records of the City within three
hundred (300) feet of the boundaries on the site for which the appeal is filed of the time and place
of the hearing.
Board Of Adjustment Variance. The Board of Adjustment shall act in accordance with the
provisions set forth in the City's Zoning Code. If the Board of Adjustment grants a variance to a
zoning regulation or standard and said regulation or standard is also contained in the City's
subdivision ordinance, then the Board of Adjustment is granting not only a zoning variance but
also a subdivision ordinance variance as well.
Board Of Aldermen Variance. The Board of Aldermen may vary or modify subdivision regulations
and standards in such a manner that the subdivider is allowed to plan and develop his/her
property and record a plat of same without unjust difficulties and expenses, but at the same time
the public welfare and interests of the City are fully protected and the general intent and spirit of
the regulations and standards are preserved.

subdivision and be enforced.
Any person violating the regulations of this Chapter, including any amendments thereto, but
excepting the preceding Subsection (B) of this Section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon
conviction thereof, such person shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or imprisoned for no more than ninety (90) days, or
both.
It shall be the duty of the Planning Director to enforce the provisions of this Chapter. However, any

Article IV. Subdivision Review and Approval Process
Section 410.140. General Procedures.
[Ord. No. 975, 3-10-1986; Ord. No. 1346 §1(21.03-A), 11-13-1989; Ord. No. 2428 §1, 2-16-2000]
In seeking to subdivide or resubdivide any tract of land within the City, the owner or his/her
authorized agent, hereafter referred to as the subdivider, shall follow the procedure relating to a
preliminary plat, improvement plans and record plat.
Copies of the City's Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances and any supplemental pertinent
documents should be obtained from the City Clerk's office.
If the subdivider seeks to record his/her subdivision in stages, the following procedure shall be
followed:
The subdivision review and approval process shall apply for each record plat intended to be
recorded.
The preliminary plat shall cover the entire tract of land intended to be subdivided.
Each record plat shall conform with its corresponding section on the preliminary plat approved
by the Commission. Any substantial deviation shall require the submission of a new
preliminary plat.
Only those improvements required to service the lots to be recorded need be installed prior to
the record plat being approved by the City; alternatively, in lieu of said improvement
installation, a bond or escrow agreement approved by the City may be posted to guarantee
improvement installation and maintenance of improvements to lots indicated on any record
plat.
Any documents requiring City review and approval shall be filed with the City in a timely manner
as may be required by the rules of the Commission or Board responsible for such review and
approval, but in no event shall the documents be filed less than fifteen (15) days before the
scheduled meeting at which they are to be reviewed.
The procedures set forth herein with respect to preliminary plats and record plats shall be
observed in connection with any subdivision, including large lot subdivisions.

Processing cost deposit.
A processing cost deposit, in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), shall be
paid into the City at the time the preliminary plat is filed in the City Planner's office.
Processing and all other actions related to the subdivision shall not proceed until the
deposit is paid in full. The deposit is for the purpose of providing funds for professional
and administrative costs incidental to the processing of plats. Any costs or expenses
incurred by the City as a result of the submission, review and final determination of any
given plat, according to the subdivision review and approval process as set out in this
Section, shall be paid for out of the said deposited amount. Said costs or expenses
incurred by the City, to be deducted from the said deposit, shall be determined by the
Finance Director from specific billings submitted to the City by the City Attorney, the City's
Planning Department and any other consulting professionals.
[Ord. No. 4417, 1-25-2021]
If at any time during the processing of the subdivision application it appears that the
processing cost deposit is insufficient to reimburse the City for all such expenses incurred
or to be incurred, the City Clerk shall present to the subdivider a listing of all actual and
anticipated costs or expenses and shall notify the subdivider of any additional cost
assessment necessary for the completion of the subdivision process. The subdivider
shall remit the additional amount to the City within ten (10) days of the date of the City
Clerk's notice, or within such additional time as may be allowed by the Chairman of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Processing and all other actions related to the
subdivision, including final determination or disposition, shall not proceed until such
additional cost assessment is paid in full. Failure to remit the additional cost assessment
shall be grounds for denial of the preliminary plat by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
Within thirty (30) days from the final determination or disposition by the City of any
subdivision plat, at whatever stage that may occur, the City Clerk shall present to the
subdivider a listing of all deposits, costs and expenses. Any portion of said deposited
monies not expended or budgeted for expenditures shall be returned to the subdivider at
that time; provided, however, that the City shall in any event retain a minimum amount of
two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) from said processing cost deposit. Conversely, if the
processing cost deposit is insufficient to reimburse the City for incurred expenses, the
subdivider, within ten (10) days of receipt of the City Clerk's accounting, shall remit
additional funds for complete reimbursement of the City's processing costs.
The deposit required herein shall be separate from, and is not intended to include, any
building or improvement or any other permit fees or any escrow monitoring fees.
Department review and notice.
The Planning Director shall determine whether the subdivision application is complete,
including the submission of an application, a processing cost deposit, a preliminary plat
and any other documents required by the Subdivision Ordinance.
If the application is complete the Planning Director shall schedule the application for
hearing by the Commission, and the Planning Department shall review the preliminary
plat for conformance with the land development standards established by Sections
410.190 and 410.200 of this Code. The Department shall then submit its report, including
any recommendations, to the Commission.
After a hearing has been scheduled by the Planning Director, the City Clerk, not less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, shall post a notice of the hearing in clear view on
the property proposed to be subdivided. Said notice shall state that the Planning and
Zoning Commission will be considering a preliminary plat for the subdivision of that
particular property, setting forth in general terms the description of the property being
considered and the date, time and place of the public hearing. The notice shall also state
that all interested persons may examine at City Hall all public documents relating to the

subdivision and may appear and be heard at the Commission's hearing concerning the
subdivision.
In addition to the posting of notice, the City shall at the same time send a copy of such
notice by first class mail to all property owners shown by the City's tax records to be
located within three hundred (300) feet of the boundaries of the property proposed to be
subdivided. The City shall also attempt to notify the trustees of adjoining subdivisions, but
the failure to notify said trustees shall not invalidate the notice.
Commission review.
Within sixty (60) days of submission of a complete application, the Commission shall hold
a hearing of record on the preliminary plat and shall approve, deny or approve with
conditions. This sixty (60) day period may be extended by the Commission upon the
request of the subdivider, or upon the request of the Department with the approval of the
subdivider. Any additional filings by the subdivider after the submission of a completed
application, including but not limited to an amended plat, shall constitute a request for
extension of time by the subdivider. If the Commission refuses to grant a requested
extension, or if the subdivider fails to approve an extension sought by the Department,
the Commission shall hold a timely hearing and shall approve, deny or approve with
conditions the plat on the record then before the Commission. Absent an extension of
time, the failure of the Commission to act within sixty (60) days of the submission of a
complete application shall be deemed an approval of the application.
In any hearing of record to consider a plat, the Municipal Code, the City's Comprehensive
Plan and land use map, the City's file on the proposed plat, all staff reports, and minutes
of all Commission meetings during which the plat was considered shall all be deemed
part of the record.
When the preliminary plat and other materials on file with the Commission fail to conform
with the land development standards established by Sections 410.190 and 410.200 of
this Code, or when those standards fail to address platted land features which may
create a risk of physical injury as provided in Section 410.150(B)(4)(c), the Department
or the Commission may request the subdivider to submit supplementary cross-sections,
surveys, studies, alignments or other engineering material to be used in analyzing and
studying the proposed subdivision of land.
Plat approval.
If the Commission finds that the preliminary plat conforms with the land development
standards established by Sections 410.190 and 410.200 of this Code, the Commission
shall approve the plat.
If the Commission finds that the preliminary plat does not conform with the land
development standards established by Sections 410.190 and 410.200 of this Code, the
Commission may approve the plat on such conditions or contingencies which would
either bring the plat into compliance with said standards or which would require a
variance from such standards.
If the Commission finds that the land development standards included in Sections
410.190 and 410.200 of this Code fail to address platted land features which create a risk
of physical injury to present or future inhabitants of the proposed, adjoining or otherwise
affected subdivision, or to other inhabitants of the City or the general public, the
Commission may approve the plat only on such conditions or contingencies that would
resolve the risk created by the unsuitable land condition.
Effect of plat approval.
Conditional approval of the preliminary plat authorizes the subdivider to prepare
subdivision improvement plans.

One (1) copy of each approved preliminary plat shall be retained by the City and one (1)
copy shall be given to the subdivider. Both copies shall be signed indicating the City's
approval.
The approval of a preliminary plat by the Commission does not constitute or effect any
acceptance by the City of the dedication to public use of any street or the ground shown
upon the plat.
The approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for one (1) year, unless the
subdivider has proceeded with completing additional steps in the City's subdivision
procedure, after which it shall be deemed void. Any resubmittal of an expired preliminary
plat shall be accompanied by a second (2nd) application and filing fee.
The record plat shall be submitted to the Board within one (1) year after approval of the
preliminary plat by the Commission. The Board may, in its discretion, grant an extension
of time for submitting the record plat to the Board, up to a maximum of six (6) months.
More than one (1) extension of time may be granted by the Board. Failure to submit the
record plat to the Board within the time prescribed herein shall void the approval of the
preliminary plat.
Within sixty (60) days after approval of the final plat by the Board, the subdivider shall
record the plat, as approved by the Board, in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, St.
Louis County, Missouri. Failure to file the final plat as approved and within the time
prescribed herein shall void the approval of the plat.
Preliminary plat denial.
If the Commission finds that the preliminary plat does not conform with the land
development standards established by Sections 410.190 and 410.200 of this Code, and
the Commission has not otherwise granted conditional approval pursuant to Section
410.150(B)(4)(b) hereof, the Commission shall deny the plat.
The denial of a preliminary plat by the Commission shall be final and not subject to
reconsideration. Any refiling of a denied preliminary plat shall be accompanied by
another subdivision application, including an additional processing cost deposit. The
Commission shall not accept the refiling of a denied preliminary plat for one (1) year from
the date of the denial unless the Commission finds that the preliminary plat has been
substantially revised to address the original plat's deficiencies or that substantial new
facts or change in circumstances warrant reapplication.
Commission findings and report. Any determination by the Commission to approve, approve
with conditions or deny a preliminary plat shall be made and entered on the record of the
Commission. If the Commission conditionally approves a preliminary plat, the Commission's
findings and conclusions in support of the conditions imposed shall be reduced to writing and
communicated to the subdivider.
Section 410.160. Improvement Plans.
[Ord. No. §1346 §1(21.03-C), 11-13-1989; Ord. No. 2429 §1, 2-16-2000]
Improvement plans shall be based on the preliminary plat approved by the Commission. Before
improvement plans involving streets in a subdivision are prepared for Planning Commission
approval, the engineers responsible to the developer for preparing such street plans are to request
and hold a pre-approval conference with the Street Commissioner and/or the consulting City
Engineer in order to inform them of the general plans being considered for the streets of the
subdivision and to obtain input from them of any special factors to be considered at the site and to
become aware of special requirements which may be required as a result of any street plan which
may be developed.

The Commission shall study the report and recommendation and approve or
disapprove the improvement plans together with the accompanying documents.
Commission approval of the improvement plans shall be indicated in writing on all
three (3) sets of plans.
Receipt by the subdivider of the signed improvement plans shall be authorization for
the subdivider to install the improvements, provided he/she first obtains a site
improvement permit from the Director.
Commission approval of the improvement plans shall be effective for two (2) years.
No extensions shall be granted without the subdivider resubmitting his/her plans and
the required accompanying documents for Commission reapproval. A filing fee of
fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be charged for the resubmission.
Inspections.
General inspections. Periodic inspection by the department shall be made of the subdivision
during the planning stages and as construction progresses.
Required inspections. A list of the required inspections made by the City shall be prepared by
the department and issued together with the improvement permit.
The subdivider shall notify the City Clerk not less than forty-eight (48) hours in advance of
required inspections that work is ready for inspection.
The City Engineer shall make his/her inspections as the official representative of the City and
shall promptly report all defects and substandard work or materials to the designated official
within the department.
The subdivider shall comply with other inspection requirements from any other agency having
jurisdiction within the City if any improvement installation is within another agency's
jurisdiction.
Permits. Prior to the grading and installation of any improvements within a subdivision, a site
improvement permit shall be obtained from the Director. The permit shall be issued after the
permit fee is paid. The fee shall be based on a charge of one percent (1%) of the estimated cost of
improvements to be installed provided the estimated cost is approved by the City Engineer. The
fee is charged to cover the City's costs related to the subdivision development. The permit shall be
valid for two (2) years. The subdivider may apply for an extension of the permit's duration. A
permit extension fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be charged. The Board shall
authorize such extension provided the subdivider has demonstrated valid hardship and
unforeseen practical difficulties.
Surety Requirements. Prior to the approval of the record plat, after approval of the improvement
plans, and after the payment of all the site improvement permit fees, the development of the
subdivision shall be guaranteed to the City.
By the satisfactory installation of the improvements in accordance with the approved
improvement plans. A contract on which there has been full performance by the developer,
including but not limited to payment in full, for the installation of public utilities and electric,
telephone, water and gas shall be deemed satisfactory completion of such utilities; or
By the posting of surety for the benefit of the City in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit,
a performance bond, an escrow account, or other guaranty, subject to the approval by the
Director and Board of Aldermen and in a form approved by the City Attorney.
The Director shall determine the amount to be assured based upon generally accepted
industry formulas for the costs of each such improvement. The amount of such surety
shall be equal to the total costs of improvements as so determined, less any of such
costs attributable to the completed improvements and less the costs of public utilities

then under contract on which there has been full performance by the developer, including
but not limited to payment in full, with each utility for completion.
Upon completion of each category of improvement or utility work for which the developer
is seeking a surety release, the developer shall submit to the Director at least three (3)
copies of "as built" drawings satisfactory to the Director which show the actual installation
of improvements, and, when applicable, certification from the developer's engineer that
the stormwater detention system satisfies the City's minimum standards in effect at the
time the improvement plans were approved by the City.
The Director shall review the "as built" drawings and determine whether each category of
the improvements have been completed and, as appropriate, accepted by the utilities.
Upon satisfactory completion of each category of the improvements as determined by the
Director and the acceptance of such improvements by the utilities (whether storm and
sanitary sewers have or have not yet been accepted for maintenance by the Metropolitan
Sewer District), a certificate of substantial completion shall be issued by the Director. In
the event there is any significant difference between such "as built" drawings and the
approved improvement plans, no certificate of substantial completion may be issued until
the difference is resolved either by requiring that the improvements be changed to
substantially conform to the plans or by the approval of the "as built" improvements by
the Planning Commission.
Within thirty (30) days of the issuance of a certificate of substantial completion, any
surety held by the City for the specified category of improvement shall be released, less
five percent (5%) of the surety amounts which shall be retained until a certificate of
completion has been issued as provided in Section 410.160(G)(2)(e) hereof. The release
shall be effective when the funds are duly posted with the United States Postal Service or
other agreed upon delivery service or when the funds are hand delivered to an
authorized person or place as specified by the developer.
Within sixty (60) days after one (1) year has elapsed since the issuance of a certificate of
substantial completion, the Board of Aldermen shall place the matter of final release of
the surety on its agenda. Notice of the date of such meeting shall be given by the City
Clerk to the principal on the surety agreement and to trustees of and owners of property
in the affected subdivision. If the Director and Board of Aldermen shall find that all of the
improvements are in satisfactory condition and all utilities have been accepted for
maintenance by the appropriate utility, a certificate of completion shall be issued and the
surety discharged and released. In the event the improvements are in satisfactory
condition, but the sewers have not yet been accepted for maintenance by the
Metropolitan Sewer District, the surety shall be released except for those remaining
surety amounts which had been established and reserved for the sewers.
In the event such certificate of completion cannot be issued as contemplated in Section
410.160(G)(2)(e) above, the developer shall immediately and satisfactorily complete the
improvements and utilities. If the developer fails to do so, the City may either draw upon
said surety amount being retained for the satisfactory completion of the improvements or
bring such legal action as may be necessary to ensure the satisfactory completion of the
improvements and utilities.
In the event a surety amount is retained as provided in Section 410.160(G)(2)(e) because
of the fact that sewers have not yet been accepted, as provided above, such amount
shall remain until such sewers have been accepted or until the Board of Aldermen, upon
application of the principal, shall release said surety for the reason that it is no longer
necessary, practical or desirable to retain such surety.

Article V. Land Development Standards
Section 410.190. General Standards.
[Ord. No. 1346 §(21.04-A), 11-13-1989; Ord. No. 2427 §1, 2-16-2000; Ord. No. 3312 §1, 1-30-2008]
In addition to the submission requirements for subdivision review and approval, the following
general standards, and the standards and specifications established in Section 410.200 of this
Chapter, shall apply to the City's review of proposed subdivision plats:
No subdivision plat shall be approved by the Commission or the Board unless it conforms to
the minimum land development standards of this Chapter. No subdivision plat shall be
approved by the Commission or the Board unless the information required by the Commission
or the Board as provided by this Chapter has been made available to the Commission or the
Board for its consideration.
All proposed subdivisions shall be coordinated with and conform to all pertinent City
ordinances, including, but not limited to, the City's Zoning Ordinance, and all such ordinances
are incorporated by reference herein.
Land within the 100-year to 500-year floodplain shall not be platted for development with
permanent structures unless the subdivider shall incorporate such improvements as are
required by the City's ordinance regulating development in the floodplain.
The subdivider is responsible for ensuring the availability of utilities, sanitary and storm
sewers, private streets and emergency services to all platted lots within a subdivision, and all
plats shall depict such facilities or appropriate features ensuring access to such facilities.
The land development standards included in this Section 410.190 have been adopted in
accordance with existing and anticipated needs to best promote the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the City and the general public. However, in the event that these standards
fail to address platted land features which create a risk of physical injury to present or future
inhabitants of the proposed, adjoining or otherwise affected subdivision, or to other
inhabitants of the City or the general public, the plat shall not be approved by either the
Commission or the Board except by the imposition of conditions or contingencies which would
resolve the risk created by the unsuitable land condition, as provided by Sections 410.150(B)
(3)(c) and 410.150(B)(7) of this Code.
Section 410.200. Standards and Specifications.
[Ord. No. 779, 4-23-1984; Ord. No. 975, 3-10-1986; Ord. No. 989, 4-14-1986; Ord. No. 1346 §1(21.04-

The proposed subdivision and street names shall not duplicate or too closely
approximate the names of a subdivision or streets within the adjacent municipalities or
the adjacent unincorporated County.
Proposed streets which are continuations of, or in general alignment with existing named
streets, shall bear the name of such existing streets.
All names of streets proposed by subdivider shall be approved by the St. Louis County
Recorder of Deeds prior to submitting the proposed record plat for review by the City.
Street specifications.
General standards for all subdivision streets.
Streets shall be established as private rather than dedicated to public use or to the
City.
Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the most recent edition of the "St.
Louis County Standard Specifications for Highway Construction" and referred to
hereafter as "St. Louis County Specifications", except as modified herein.

or puddling within the street right-of-way. This shall be accomplished by appropriate
contouring, swales, ditches, curbing and stormwater sewers.
Street grades shall be limited to eight percent (8%) maximum in order to insure
reasonable traffic movement without chains on plowed streets with some packed
snow. However, grades up to ten percent (10%) shall be acceptable if the Planning
Commission and Board of Aldermen deem topographical conditions are present
whereby the application of the eight percent (8%) maximum would create conditions
for the ultimate property owners of the subdivision which would be more
disadvantageous than the increased movement difficulty during snowy weather.
The crown of all street paving shall be uniform and at 0.02 feet per foot.
Crests of hills on streets shall provide a minimum distance of visibility between
vehicles of two hundred (200) feet. For purposes of this Chapter, a three and onehalf
(3½) foot sight level for a distance of at least two hundred (200) feet shall be the
minimum acceptable.
The extent and placement of curb cuts onto major and minor streets shall require the
City's approval and the approval of the party or entities having jurisdiction over said
street. Due to the increased traffic from the subdivision, the subdivider may be
required to make right-of-way dedication for the ultimate improvement of the major or
minor street at the intersection of the proposed subdivision street and the major or
minor street.
Streets shall be constructed with shoulders and a ditch unless curbing is provided.
Alleys shall not be provided in residential areas.
All disturbed earth within the right-of-way shall be seeded or sodded immediately
following completion of street paving and final earth grading.

The danger of life and property due to flooding, stormwater or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood, stormwater or erosion
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, not subject to flooding,
stormwater or erosion damage; or alternative designs of the building;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the Zoning Code of the City and the floodplain
management program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The general expected or relative costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
Generally, variances from the flood control regulations set forth in Article II herein may be issued
for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the
base flood level, providing Subsections (E)(1) through (10) of this Section have been fully
considered. As the parcel size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing any variance increases and the Board of Adjustment may require submission
of additional data and preparation of alternative plans.
Variances from the flood control regulations set forth in Article II herein shall not be issued within
any designated floodway which would increase flood levels during the base flood more than one
(1) foot at any point.
The following prerequisites for the issuance of a variance shall be in effect:
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause that specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation.

[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010; Ord. No. 4034 §1, 11-14-2016]
This Article seeks to provide those standards, criteria, procedures and controls necessary to
minimize the harmful physical and economic effects of erosion and flooding from stormwater
within the City. This is to be accomplished through the requirement of special measures to mitigate
erosion both during and after construction or grading and the detention and controlled discharge of
the differential runoff from any site whereon any grading, excavation, filling or other disturbance of
the natural vegetation or any construction, erection or alteration of a building or structure is to be
undertaken.
Generally. Except as provided below, these stormwater and erosion control regulations shall
be complied with whenever any person constructs, erects, alters or enlarges any building or
structure or otherwise develops any property within the City in such manner as to change the
land area covered by the building or structure and whenever any person clears, grades,
excavates, fills or otherwise changes the contour of any land in the City.
Exceptions. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to:
Any reconstruction, repair or alteration of any existing building or structure when no land,
trees, shrubs, grass or other vegetation is to be disturbed, destroyed or removed;
The clearing, grading, excavation, filling, removing topsoil from or changing the contour
of less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of land.
Any project which disturbs more than one acre of land and is therefore required to obtain
a land disturbance permit through the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the
Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District shall be exempt from Section 415.105(C) but rather
will be required to meet the requirements of the other regulating agencies.
In considering the applicability of these exceptions, the effective acreage for a project,
development or subdivision is not limited to a fractional part of the total concept. Rather, if
a project is developed in phases or small plats, the total acreage of the project,
development or subdivision shall be considered. Furthermore, projects of less acreage
than provided for in this Article shall also provide detention if, in the judgment of the
Director, conditions in the receiving system are inadequate or harmful effects can be
anticipated if detention is not implemented.
Section 415.090. Procedure.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010]
Plans and documents clearly demonstrating that all permits for stormwater discharges required by
the State including, but not limited to, those set forth in 10 CSR 20-6.200, have been secured and
that the proposed construction and/or development meets all standards and criteria for stormwater
and erosion control as described in this Article shall be submitted as a part of any application for a
site improvement permit or an application for a building permit.
All plans and specifications submitted for review and/or approval shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Missouri and shall
meet the minimum standards and requirements of the City, the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer
District and other applicable authorities. Each of the plan, profile and special drawing sheets for a
project shall bear a legible seal of the professional engineer in charge.
All plans shall include a letter of transmittal stating the name of project, name and address of
owner or developer, name, address and telephone number of engineer and the purpose of
submittal.
No permit for any construction, improvement or development within the City shall be issued until
the Director has verified that the proposed construction, improvement or development fully

complies with these stormwater and erosion control regulations.
Section 415.100. Minimum Standards.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010]
Facilities for storm drainage shall be designed and constructed so as to prevent any increase in
the rate of storm runoff into the water shed over that which existed prior to development with some
portions mitigated as delineated in Section 415.105 of this Code. It is not the intent of these
provisions to eliminate specific erosion or flooding which existed prior to development but rather to
prevent any increase or expansion of said situations by the construction improvement or
development.
[Ord. No. 4034 §2, 11-14-2016]
All stormwater improvements shall be designed, constructed and installed in conformance with
Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District (MSD) regulations.
Every land development or subdivision shall make adequate provisions to accommodate or
dispose of stormwater and prevent damage to off-site streets and downslope of adjacent
properties due to soil erosion or siltation by means of sodding, erecting silt barriers, detention
storage areas, sewers, catch basins, culverts, terracing, walls and other facilities or combination of
similar methods per the requirements of this Article. Such facilities are to be maintained by the
owners of the subject property or owners of the subdivision through agreement by the appropriate
trust indenture or deed restriction or by the appropriate public agency or utility.
All detention basins shall be located in stormwater control easements with access easements
provided where required. In multi-lot subdivisions, detention basins shall be located in common
ground.
Stormwater pipes, outlets and channels shall be protected by silt barriers and kept free of waste
and silt at all times prior to final surface stabilization and street paving.
Slopes steeper than five (5) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical (5:1) shall be protected by
sodding or paving upon completion of grading or construction.
Any construction, improvement or development shall make adequate provisions to minimize and
control both long- and short-term erosion utilizing temporary control measures and long-term
erosion control measures as described in Section 415.090. Such measures shall be planned or in
place prior to clearing or grading operations.
The storm system for a proposed subdivision or land development shall be designed to
accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside
the subdivision or land development. The Director shall review the proposed system to assure it is
sufficient to accommodate existing upstream stormwater and any anticipated increase in upstream
volume resulting from development permitted by the Zoning Code and adjacent jurisdictions and
the estimated development potential of the watershed.
The Director shall study the effect of each subdivision or land development on the existing
downstream drainage facilities both inside and outside the area of development. Where it is
anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an
existing downstream facility, the Planning and Zoning Commission may withhold approval of the
improvement plans and final subdivision plat or site development plans until sufficient provisions
have been made to eliminate such overload. No subdivision or land development shall be
approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or
catchment and storage facility. Complete hydrologic computations including, but not limited to,
outlet velocities shall be submitted with subdivision improvement plans or site development plans,
where requested, to support the storm sewer design.

Discharge into an open natural creek or swale on the same property; or
Discharge that is parallel to the abutting property line and at least five (5) feet from said line.
Section 415.105. Requirements for Issuance of Permits
Impacting Stormwater Flow Patterns or Rates.
[Ord. No. 4034 §3, 11-14-2016]
Prior to the issuance of any permit which controls the application of new structures, site
improvements or other systems which impact stormwater flow patterns or rates, the applicant must
provide the following:
Site plan sealed by a professional engineer (multiple sheets as necessary) developed in
accordance with Section 405.260(A)(1)(a) through (i) of the Town and Country Municipal
Code.
Calculation of stormwater flow rate differential from the preexisting site conditions to the
proposed post-construction condition. This shall be for the fifteen-year, twenty-minute design
storm calculated by the Rational Method using PI factors in accordance with the most recent
"Storm Water Design Criteria" of the "Design Requirements for Storm Drainage Facilities" as
issued by the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District.
Provision of a system which mitigates one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the flow rate
increase identified in Section 415.105(A)(2) above by storing a volume equal to one hundred
fifty percent (150%) of the calculated volume for the fifteen-year, twenty-minute design storm.
This shall then be designed with a release mechanism which allows for dissipation over a
twelve-hour-to-thirty-six-hour period using small orifice structures or Metropolitan St. Louis
Sewer District-approved volume reduction best management practices.
An operation and maintenance manual for the system referenced in Section 415.105(A)(3)
shall be provided at the time of the site plan submittal. This manual and the site plan shall
clearly note that the maintenance of the system is the responsibility of the property owner and
not the City of Town and Country or the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District.
Provision of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) sealed by the engineer of
record addressing the temporary site conditions from the commencement of the project until
issuance of permanent occupancy:
Temporary erosion control measures.
Temporary water volume control measures.
Operation and maintenance guidelines.
Section 415.110. Temporary and Long-Term Stormwater and
Erosion Control Requirements.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010]
Generally. Every land development or subdivision shall make adequate provisions to minimize and
control both long- and short-term erosion in accordance with the requirements of this Article.

Temporary Control Measures.
Temporary erosion and sediment control measures are intended to maintain siltation on the
land development or subdivision especially if construction is not going to be complete within a
single construction season.
Grading shall be phased so that the amount of exposed area at any one (1) time is minimized.
Each application for a site improvement permit or building permit shall include a grading plan
of the site in sufficient detail to indicate proposed grading phases.
Graded areas shall be stabilized immediately upon grading and maintained to prevent or
minimize erosion until permanent stabilization measures are in place. Permissible temporary
erosion control techniques include contour furrowing or other surface roughening techniques,
fertilizing, seeding, mulching and/or sodding. On steep slopes (twenty-five percent (25%) or
greater) the application of asphalt emulsion is a desirable technique.
Slope changes should be designed to keep the slope length and gradient to a minimum, thus
minimizing stormwater velocities over graded areas.
Measures shall be taken to direct stormwater from graded portions of the site. This may be
accomplished utilizing diversion berms, ditches and/or sediment basins.
Sediment shall be retained on site by filtering runoff and/or by providing properly designed
siltation basins.
Truck and equipment accessways to the site of the operation shall be located so as to
minimize danger to traffic and nuisance to surrounding properties. Such access shall be kept
either wet or oiled or treated with a chemical dust deterrent or placed to the extent necessary
to prevent any dust nuisance to surrounding properties. All such accessways shall be posted
approximately two hundred (200) feet distant from such accessways or other traveled areas.
Such signs shall read "Caution: Trucks Entering" and be of an appropriate size, type, coloring,
lettering and format per the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and
Highways (MUTCD). Debris, soil and other materials shall be removed from trucks before
they leave the site. Streets and sidewalks shall be maintained free of soil and debris.
Long-Term Erosion Control. All subdivision and land development plans shall incorporate into the
improvement or site improvement permit plans measures designed to minimize grading and
control erosion. Approval of any subdivision plat shall be conditional upon verification by the
Director that the plans conform to the following standards:
All excavations, grading or filling shall have a finished grade not to exceed thirty-three percent
(33%) except that embankments less than three (3) feet in height shall be exempt therefrom if
properly sodded. Steeper grades are allowed if the excavation is through rock or the
excavation or fill is protected by a properly designed revetment or retaining wall approved by
the Director. Such walls shall not normally exceed a height of six (6) feet.
Grading plans shall provide for sediment basins, silt barriers, diversions, grass waterways,
mulching, seeding and other acceptable erosion control techniques whenever necessary to
avoid damage to adjoining properties, road ditches and storm sewers.
The finished grade shall provide that surface water from drainage areas in excess of two (2)
acres shall be intercepted by diversion swales or inlets and lowered to a stable outlet
constructed of concrete, riprap or pipe.
Land adjoining the proposed land development or subdivision shall be provided with
protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt disposition and any other
consequences of erosion. Where it is necessary for the protection of such property to enter
upon property outside the control of the applicant for such purpose, appropriate consent must
be obtained by the applicant. The applicant shall, at his/her own expense, shore up and
protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress

of the grading and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property resulting
from his/her failure to properly protect and carry out such grading.
Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings. Individual lot
drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage
shall be designed so as to substantially prevent stormwater drainage from each lot onto
adjacent lots.
Landscaping shall be provided in the form of seeded or sodded grass, ground cover, low
walls, earth berms, trees and shrubbery to enhance the appearance and the functions of all
erosion control facilities.
Section 415.120. Construction and Maintenance of Stormwater
and Erosion Control Facilities.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010]
Detention facilities, when mandatory, are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer installation
and/or grading. Since these facilities are intended to control increased runoff, they must be
partially or fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation.
Silt and debris connected both with early construction and with general erosion from the site and
elsewhere in the watershed after construction shall be removed periodically from the detention
area and control structure in order to maintain close to full storage capacity.
The responsibility of maintenance of the detention facilities in subdivision projects shall remain
with the developer until such time as applicable escrows are released. Upon release of escrows
the maintenance responsibility shall be vested in the trustees of the subdivision by virtue of the
trust indenture. The indenture of the trust shall clearly indicate resident responsibility for
maintenance in cases of projects without common areas.
The responsibility of maintenance of the detention facilities in single owner development projects
shall remain with the general contractor until final inspection of the development is performed and
approved and a legal occupancy permit is issued. After legal occupancy of the project, the
maintenance of detention facilities shall be vested with the owner of the project.
Section 415.130. Enforcement, Violations and Penalties.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010]
Compliance with stormwater and erosion control regulations shall be subject to all provisions of the
Municipal Code relating to enforcement, violations and penalties. In addition, a corporate surety bond

Threatened public structure or improvement; or
Surface flows altered or caused by a public improvement; or
Cannot reasonably be completed by individual property owner due to the necessary
involvement of other parties or agencies outside of that individual's control; or
Altered upstream conditions; or
Inadequate system design under previously less restrictive development regulations.
Issues determined to be the result of the actions of an individual property owner impacting his or
her own property are not eligible for programming. Issues created as the result of the actions of an
individual property owner which impact downstream properties are not eligible, but instead shall
be considered a matter to be referred for civil action between the affected parties. The
maintenance of functioning systems under the control or ownership of other agencies, political
subdivisions, private individuals or subdivision trust associations are not eligible for programming.
Section 415.155. Benefit Calculation.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010; Ord. No. 3856 §1, 10-27-2014]
The preliminary project scope is to be prepared by the Director. The LBI for each affected
residential property and Section of public property shall also be calculated by the Director
individually as a part of the preliminary project scope. The sum of these individual LBI calculations
shall comprise the total benefit calculation for the project. The probable opinion of cost is to be
prepared by the Director under contract with a qualified professional services provider or utilizing
internal resources.
The preliminary project scope, probable opinion of cost and LBI are to be reviewed in open
session by the Commission. All affected property owners shall be informed of this review at least
one (1) week prior to the session utilizing the United States Postal Service. Upon solicitation of

Individual property owners, subdivision organizations and other interested parties may make a
monetary contribution to a project. Any contributions pledged by outside sources shall be identified as
a part of the probable opinion of cost and deducted from the total project cost prior to the calculation of
the cost-to-benefit ratio. This adjusted ratio shall be utilized in the project ranking. No project with an
adjusted ranking shall be implemented prior to the commitment of funds by the outside sources. These
funds shall be placed in escrow with the City prior to the commitment of any resources by the City for
the project.
Section 415.170. Reevaluation/ Inactivation.
[Ord. No. 3510 §1, 5-10-2010; Ord. No. 3856 §1, 10-27-2014]
Each project shall be reevaluated by the Commission no less than every three (3) years. If
changes in project scope are identified by the Director or requested by the affected property
owners, the project may be reevaluated annually prior to the presentation of the program to the
Board of Aldermen.
In the event that the progress of a project becomes stalled during the design stage due to a failure
to reach an agreement/solution with the impacted parties, and it is so deemed by the Public Works
and Stormwater Commission, a project can be recommended to be placed on inactive status.
Prior to this designation, a hearing shall be held at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Public
Works and Stormwater Commission. The recommendation to place a project on inactive status
shall include a set of conditions which if met will allow the inactive status to be lifted. All impacted
parties shall be notified of such hearing via first class mail. Upon recommendation of placement
upon inactive status, all application of City resources shall be suspended until such a time as the
project is returned to active status. A project may be returned to status once the conditions have
been met and a review of the project has been held by the Public Works and Stormwater
Commission. This placement upon inactive status shall be reported to the Board of Aldermen as a
part of the five-year Capital Plan.

Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Town and Country, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a
series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Article is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on
the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for St. Louis County
dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Section 415.230. Statement of Purpose.
[Ord. No. 3855 §1, 10-27-2014]
It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Section 415.220(A); to establish or maintain the community's
eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by
applying the provisions of this Article to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding
or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

Section 415.520. Specific Standards.
[Ord. No. 3855 §1, 10-27-2014]
In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, where base flood
elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Section 415.510(B), the following provisions are
required:
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.
NOTE: In all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones, the FEMA, Region VII office
recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation to accommodate
floodway conditions when the floodplain is fully developed.
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that
below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional

through (F) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2)
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of
historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's
continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required by this Article.
Section 415.660. Conditions for Approving Variances for
Accessory Structures.
[Ord. No. 3855 §1, 10-27-2014]

analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Sections 415.640 and 415.650 of
this Article. In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat
to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for
accessory structures that are constructed at grade and wet-floodproofed:
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with Section 415.510(D)(2) of this Article.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Section 415.510(D)(1) of this Article. All
of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related
forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed

result during the one-hundred-year flood.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Article.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community
and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain

Section 420.010. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 4419, 2-8-2021[1]]
The purpose of this Chapter is to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of
communication, to maintain and enhance the aesthetic appearance of the City, and to facilitate
and improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic safety. This Chapter is intended to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare through a comprehensive set of reasonable standards and
requirements. This Chapter is further intended to allow for the identification of places of
commerce, the communication of public and commercial information necessary for efficient and
safe traffic and pedestrian movement; to allow for freedom of speech in a manner acceptable to
the community and not obscene or threatening; to protect the public from dangers of unsafe signs;
to lessen hazardous situations, confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation of signs
competing for attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and to enhance the attractiveness and
economic well-being of the City.
For the purpose of assuring compliance with these requirements, no person shall erect or maintain
within the City any sign except as specified in this Chapter. Signs not in conformance with this
Chapter shall not be permitted in any district as an accessory use or structure.

hazardous to pedestrian or vehicular traffic by reason of, but not limited to, deterioration,
damage, obstruction of walkways or fire access or exit lanes, restricting sight distances
for vehicular or pedestrian traffic or is located so close to travel lanes or parking areas
that it is struck by maneuvering vehicles, then such signs shall be relocated, removed, or
protected by the owner, agent, or person having beneficial use of the premises or lot
within ten (10) days of notification from the City Administrator that such hazard does
exist. If, in the opinion of the City Administrator, the condition or location of the sign
presents imminent danger to the public, it shall be removed or corrected by the owner,
agent, or person having beneficial use of the premises or lot promptly upon receipt of
written notice from the City Administrator.
All outdoor signs and supports shall be weather resistant and shall be maintained in good
repair so as to prevent rust, peeling, flaking or fading. Broken panels, missing letters,
flaking or peeling paint and other visual damage to a sign shall be repaired within fortyfive
(45) days of occurrence or within thirty (30) days of notification from the City
Administrator, whichever occurs first.
Every permanent sign shall be constructed of rigid weatherproof materials and provisions
shall be made for electric grounding of all metallic parts.
No sign shall be erected or maintained so that, by its position, shape, wording, device, or
color, it might interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized

Section 505.220. Right-Of-Way ("ROW") Permits.
[Ord. No. 3290 §1(B), 10-23-2007]
Application Requirements.
Any person desiring to perform ROW work must first apply for and obtain a ROW permit in
addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise or authorization required by
law. In the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the person conducting the work shall
as soon as practicable notify the City of the location of the work and shall apply for the
required ROW permit as soon as practicable following the commencement of the work, not to
exceed the third (3rd) business day thereafter. The Director may design and issue general
permits for emergency ROW work for several different locations or throughout the City.
An application for a ROW permit shall be submitted to the Director. The Director may design
and make available standard forms for such applications, requiring such information as
allowed by law and as the Director determines in his or her discretion to be necessary and
consistent with the provisions of this Article and to accomplish the purposes of this Article.
Each application shall at minimum contain the following information for the proposed ROW
work, unless otherwise waived by the Director:
The name, address and telephone number of a representative whom the City may notify
or contact at any time (i.e., twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week)
concerning the work;
If different from the applicant, the name, address and telephone number of the person on
whose behalf the proposed work is to be performed;
A description of the proposed work, including a conceptual master plan and an
engineering site plan or other technical drawing or depiction showing the nature,

dimensions, location and description of the applicant's proposed work or facilities, their
proximity to other facilities that may be affected by the proposed work and the number of
street crossings and their locations and dimensions, if applicable;
Projected commencement and termination dates and anticipated duration of the work or,
if such dates are unknown, a representation that the applicant shall provide the Director
with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are determined;
Copies of any required certificates of insurance or performance and maintenance bonds.
The information required by the application may be submitted in the form maintained by the
applicant, provided it is responsive to the application's requirements and the applicant shall
be allowed a reasonable amount of time to complete the application based on the amount of
data or information requested or required.
Each such application shall be accompanied by the following payments:
An application fee approved by the City to cover the cost of processing the application;
Any other amounts due to the City from the applicant including, but not limited to, prior
delinquent fees, costs and any loss, damage or expense suffered by the City because of
the applicant's prior work in the rights-of-way or for any emergency actions taken by the
City, but the Director may modify this requirement to the extent the Director determines
any such fees to be in good faith dispute.
Applicants shall participate in any joint planning, construction and advance notification of such
work, including coordination and consolidation of any excavation of or disturbance to the
rights-of-way, as directed by the Director. When deemed necessary to accomplish the goals
of this Section and to the extent permitted by law, the City reserves the right, when feasible
and reasonable, to require the sharing of facilities by ROW users. Applicants shall cooperate
with each other and other ROW users and the City for the best, most efficient, least intrusive,
most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the rights-of-way.
The Director shall establish procedures allowing applicants to ascertain whether existing
capacity may be available from other persons utilizing the rights-of-way along the intended
path of any proposed work. The Director shall also maintain indexes of all ROW permits
issued, both by the ROW user and by the affected rights-of-way.
Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the obligation to obtain a conditional use or other
applicable permit for the placement of facilities when also required by the Municipal Code.
Application Review And Determination.
The Director shall promptly review each completed application for a ROW permit and shall
grant or deny all such applications as provided herein within thirty-one (31) days of receipt
thereof. Unless the application is denied, the Director shall issue a ROW permit upon
determining that the applicant:
Has submitted all necessary information,
Has paid the appropriate fees, and
Is in full compliance with this Article and all other City ordinances. The Director may
establish procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic payment of fees to
avoid excessive processing and accounting costs.
It is the intention of the City that interference with, damage to, excavation or disruption of or
the placement of facilities within the City's rights-of-way should be minimized and limited in
scope to the extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of this Article. When reasonable
and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the Director may require as alternatives to the
proposed ROW work either less disruptive methods or different locations for facilities,
provided that any required alternative:
1/3/22, 10:49 PM City of Town And Country, MO Ecode360

Shall not increase expenses by more than ten percent (10%) of the applicant's costs for
the work as proposed,
Shall not result in a decline of service quality, and
Shall be competitively neutral and non-discriminatory. The Director shall justify to the
applicant that the required alternative is reasonable and necessary.
Upon receipt of an application, the Director shall determine whether any portion of the rightsof-
way will be affected by the proposed work and whether the interference, disruption or
placement of facilities will be more than minor in nature. In determining whether the proposed
work is more than minor in nature, the Director shall consider the nature and scope of the
work, its location and duration and its effect on the rights-of-way, the use thereof and
neighboring properties.
If the applicant can show to the Director's reasonable satisfaction that the work involves
no interference, disruption, excavation or damage to or only minor interference with the
rights-of-way or that the work does not involve the placement of facilities or involves timesensitive
maintenance, then the Director shall promptly grant the ROW permit.
If the Director determines that the effect on the rights-of-way will be more than minor in
nature and no exemption under the above paragraph (3)(a) or any other provision of this
Article applies, the Director shall schedule and coordinate the work and grant the ROW
permit accordingly. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purposes of this
Article, the Director may postpone issuance of a ROW permit and may give public notice
of the application in an attempt to identify whether other person(s) intend to do work in
the same area within a reasonable period of time, so that all ROW work in the area can
be coordinated. Due regard shall be accorded applicants that are required by any law,
rule, regulation, license or franchise to provide service to the area defined in the
application. The Director shall not impose any coordination or scheduling requirements
that prevent or unreasonably delay an applicant's access to the ROW or that create a
barrier to entry.
Each ROW permit issued by the Director shall include:
Projected commencement and termination dates or, if such dates are unknown at the
time the permit is issued, a provision requiring the ROW user to provide the Director with
reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are determined;
Length of affected rights-of-way, number of road crossings and identification and
description of any pavement or curb cuts included in the work;
Information regarding scheduling and coordination of work, if necessary;
The location of any of the applicant's facilities, both those proposed and existing, and the
location of any known facilities owned by another person that may be affected by the
proposed work;
An acknowledgment and representation by the applicant to comply with the terms and
conditions of the ROW permit and this Article; and
Such conditions and requirements as are deemed reasonably necessary by the Director
to protect structures and other facilities in the rights-of-way from damage, to restore such
rights-of-way and any structures or facilities to ensure the reasonable continuity and sight
lines of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and to protect property values, the aesthetics of
adjoining properties and neighborhoods and the public health, safety and welfare.
The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in the public interest, for the
following reasons:
Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;

Failure to return the ROW to its previous condition under previously issued ROW permits
or after prior excavations by the applicant;
For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity as defined by applicable
Federal, State or local law;
For the applicant's refusal to comply with alternative ROW work methods, locations or
other reasonable conditions required by the Director; and
For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provided that such
denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service
Commission or interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of private property
and, provided further, that such denial is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory
basis.
Permit Revocation And Ordinance Violations.
The Director may revoke a ROW permit without fee refund after notice and an opportunity to
cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the permit or
this Article. Prior to revocation the Director shall provide written notice to the ROW user
identifying any substantial breach and allowing a reasonable period of time not longer than
thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure period may be immediate if certain activities
must be stopped to protect the public safety. The cure period shall be extended by the
Director on good cause shown by the ROW user. A substantial breach includes, but is not
limited to, the following:
A material violation of a provision of the ROW permit or this Article;
An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the ROW permit or this Article
or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its
residents;
A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW permit application;
A failure to complete ROW work by the date specified in the ROW permit, unless an
extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond
the ROW user's control; and
A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as specified by the
Director, work that does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances, industry
construction standards, this Article or any other applicable ordinances, provided that City
standards are no more stringent than those of a national safety ordinance.
Any breach of the terms and conditions of a ROW permit shall also be deemed a violation of
this Article and in lieu of revocation the Director may initiate prosecution of the ROW user for
such violation.

with all applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and the ROW permit.
The Director shall have full access to all portions of the ROW work and may issue stop work
orders and corrective orders to prevent unauthorized work or substandard work as
established in Subsection (G) hereof. Such orders:
May be delivered personally or by certified mail to the address(es) listed on the
application for the ROW permit or the person in charge of the construction site at the time
of delivery;
Shall state that substandard work or work not authorized by the ROW permit is being
carried out, summarize the substandard or unauthorized work and provide a period of not
longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure period may be immediate if
certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety; and
May be enforced by equitable action in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri,
and in such case the person responsible for the substandard or unauthorized work shall
be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the City in enforcing such orders,
including reasonable attorney's fees, in addition to any and all penalties established in
this Article.
Underground Facilities.
In conjunction with the City's long-standing policy favoring underground construction, no
person may erect, construct or install new poles or other facilities above the surface of the
rights-of-way without the written permission of the City, unless the City's authority has been
pre-empted by State or Federal law. Such permission may be granted through a ROW permit
when other similar facilities exist above ground or when conditions are such that underground
construction is impossible, impractical or economically unfeasible as determined by the City
and when in the City's judgment the above ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact
on the area where the construction is proposed.
During installation of facilities and to the extent authorized by law, existing underground
conduits shall be used whenever feasible and permitted by the owner thereof.
In the case of new construction or property development, the developer or property owner
shall give reasonable written notice, to other potential ROW users as directed by the City, of
the particular date on which open trenching will be available for installation of facilities. Costs
of trenching and easements required to bring facilities within the development shall be borne
by the developer or property owner; except that if the facilities are not installed within five (5)
working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the
developer or property owner, then once the trenches are thereafter closed, the cost of new
trenching shall be borne by the person installing the facilities.
Above Ground Facilities.
The Director may designate certain locations or facilities in the ROW to be excluded from use
by the applicant for its facilities including, but not limited to:
Ornamental or similar specially designed street lights,
Designated historic areas,
Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that do not have electrical service adequate
or appropriate for the proposed facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading
thereof,
Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that in the reasonable judgment of the
Director are incompatible with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe or
unstable by the installation, and

Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that have been designated or planned for
other use or are not otherwise available for use by the applicant due to engineering,
technological, proprietary, legal or other limitations or restrictions.
Above ground facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective or metallic.
Black, gray and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Facilities shall be located in
such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. A sight proof landscape screen may
be required for any authorized above ground facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or
covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to
reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of
landscaping materials shall be approved by the Director prior to installation of any facility
requiring landscape screening. The person having facilities within the ROW shall be
responsible for the installation, repair or replacement of screening materials. Alternative
screening or concealment may be approved by the Director to the extent it meets or exceeds
the purposes of these requirements.
Above ground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to
emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and shall comply with all other applicable regulations
and standards established by the City or State or Federal law.
If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for above ground facilities to the extent
that the exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director
shall cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but
such alternatives may exceed the cost increase limitation established by Section 505.220(B)
(2) and the City shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for
the applicant.
Relocation Of Equipment And Facilities.
In the event of an emergency or where construction equipment or facilities create or are
contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, the City may, to the extent
allowed by law, remove, re-lay or relocate such construction equipment or the pertinent parts
of such facilities without charge to the City for such action or for restoration or repair. The City
shall attempt to notify the person having facilities within the ROW prior to taking such action,
but the inability to do so shall not prevent same. Thereafter, the City shall notify the person
having facilities within the ROW as soon as practicable.
At the City's direction, all facilities shall be moved underground and the cost shall be solely
the obligation of the person having facilities within the ROW (or as otherwise allowed or
required by law).
At the City's direction, a person having facilities within the ROW shall protect, support,
disconnect, relocate or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to
accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation or maintenance of streets
or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety or welfare.
A person having facilities within the ROW shall, on the reasonable request of any person and
after reasonable advance written notice, protect, support, disconnect, relocate or remove
facilities to accommodate such person and the actual cost, reasonably incurred, of such
actions shall be paid by the person requesting such action. The person having facilities within
the ROW taking such action may require such payment in advance.
Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW user may abandon the
facilities if approved by the City as provided in Subsection (F) of this Section.
No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property and no person shall be entitled to
any compensation therefor. No location of any facilities within the rights-of-way shall be a
vested interest.

Property Repair And Alterations.
During any ROW work, the person doing the work shall protect from damage any and all
existing structures and property belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all
rights-of-way, public property or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall
be repaired or replaced by the person doing the work or the person on whose behalf the work
is being done and such person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of any damaged
property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified by
the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any City, State
or other public structures or facilities in the rights-of-way required on account of the
construction, installation, repair or maintenance of facilities within the rights-of-way shall be
made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such facilities.
Removal, Abandonment, Transfer And Relocation Of Facilities.
If a person having facilities within the ROW:
Installs the facilities within the ROW without having complied with the requirements of
this Article, or
Abandons the facilities, the City may require the removal of the facilities, remove the
facilities at the expense of the person having facilities within the ROW or require the
transfer of the facilities as provided herein.
If the City requires removal of the facilities, the person shall obtain a ROW permit and shall
abide by all requirements of this Article. The liability, indemnity, insurance and bonding
requirements required herein shall continue in full force and effect during and after the period
of removal and restoration and until full compliance by the person with the terms and
conditions of the ROW permit and the requirements of this Article.
If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been directed to do so, the City may, to
the extent permitted by law, have the removal done at the person's expense. Alternatively, the
City may permit the abandonment, without removal, of the facilities if the Director determines
that abandonment is not likely to prevent or significantly impair the future use, repair,
excavation, maintenance or construction of the ROW.
If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been directed to do so, the City may, to
the extent permitted by law, decide that the ownership of the facilities should be transferred to
the City or to such person as directed by the City. In either case the owner of the facilities
shall submit a written instrument, satisfactory in form to City, transferring to the City, or to such
person as directed by the City, ownership of the facilities. The City may sell, assign or transfer
all or part of the facilities so transferred.
The City shall not remove or seek to possess or transfer the facilities until thirty (30) days
have passed following written notice by the Director to the person having facilities within the
ROW of the City's intent to so act. The Director may choose not to act on good cause shown
by the person having facilities within the ROW.
Standards For ROW Work.
Except for emergency ROW work as provided in Section 505.220(A)(1), ROW work shall be
performed only upon issuance and in accordance with the requirements of a ROW permit. At
all times during the work, ROW permits shall be conspicuously displayed at the work site and
shall be available for inspection by the Director.
If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the ROW work is or will become
materially different from that allowed by the ROW permit, the ROW user shall inform the
Director. The Director may issue a waiver, an extension or a revised ROW permit or require

that the ROW user reapply for a ROW permit in accordance with all requirements of this
Article.
ROW users shall not open or encumber more of the rights-of-way than is reasonably
necessary to complete the ROW work in the most expeditious manner or allow excavations to
remain open longer than is necessary to complete the work.
All ROW work that affects vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded
and otherwise protected at the ROW user's expense. The ROW user shall be responsible for
providing adequate traffic control to the area surrounding the work as determined by the
Director.
The ROW user shall perform the ROW work at such times that will allow the least interference
with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood as permitted by
the Director. Unless otherwise provided by the Director in the permit, non-emergency ROW
work on arterial and collector streets may not be accomplished during the hours of 7:00 A.M.
to 8:30 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow.
The ROW user shall notify the City no less than three (3) working days in advance of any
ROW work that would require any street closure or would reduce traffic flow to less than two
(2) lanes of moving traffic for more than four (4) hours. Except in the event of emergency
ROW work, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior authorization from the
City.
All ROW work shall be in accordance with all applicable Sections of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code and other Federal, State or local
laws and regulations that may apply including, without limitation, local health, safety,
construction and zoning ordinances and laws and accepted industry practices, all as hereafter
may be amended or adopted. In the event of a conflict among ordinances and standards, the
most stringent ordinance or standard shall apply (except insofar as that ordinance or
standard, if followed, would result in facilities that could not meet requirements of Federal,
State or local law).
All facilities shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and
convenience of property owners, other ROW users and the City. Facilities shall not be placed

Restoring And Maintaining The Rights-Of-Way.
To complete any ROW work, the ROW user shall restore the ROW and surrounding areas,
including, but not limited to, any pavement, foundation, concrete slabs or curbs, screening,
landscaping or vegetation, and shall comply with other reasonable conditions of the Director.
Restoration of the ROW shall be completed within the dates specified in the ROW permit
unless the Director issues a waiver, extension or a new or revised ROW permit.
It shall be the duty of any person making an excavation in the ROW to backfill such
excavations and restore the surface in accordance with the City's minimum prescribed
standards for such surfaces or the following standards as determined by the Director.
If the excavations are made in the improved portion of the ROW, twelve (12) inches of
granular backfill will be placed over exposed facilities and controlled low strength material
(CLSM) will fill the hole within eight (8) inches of the finished surface for concrete
pavements. There will be a plastic membrane placed between the rock base and the
CLSM to prevent the material from bleeding into the rock base. The remaining eight (8)
inches will be restored by placing a twenty-eight (28) day minimum strength, four
thousand five hundred (4,500) psi concrete mix.
If the excavations are made in the improved portion of an asphalt or combination street,
twelve (12) inches of granular backfill will be placed over exposed facilities and CLSM will
fill the hole within nine (9) inches of the finished surface. There will be a plastic
membrane placed between the rock base and the CLSM to prevent the material from
bleeding into the rock base. The remaining nine (9) inches will be restored by placing a
six (6) inch thick, twenty-eight (28) day minimum strength, four thousand five hundred
(4,500) psi concrete mix under a three (3) inch asphalt concrete lift of type C mix to meet
existing grades.
Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in residential ROW will be constructed of six
(6) inches of compacted rock base and three (3) inches of type C asphalt concrete mix.
Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in commercial ROW will be constructed of
four (4) inches of compacted rock base, seven and one-half (7.5) inches of type X and
three (3) inches of type C asphalt concrete mix. Concrete driveway approaches will
consist of a four (4) inch compacted rock base and be a minimum of six (6) inches thick
in residential ROW and eight (8) inches thick in commercial ROW.
If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the date specified either by the ROW permit or
any extension thereof as granted by the Director, the City may perform its own restoration.
The City may also opt to perform its own restoration regardless of any failure by the ROW
user, in which case the ROW permit or any amendment or revision thereto shall note such
option. In either event, if the City performs the restoration, the ROW user shall be responsible
for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual restoration costs within thirty (30) days of invoice.

Every ROW user to whom a ROW permit has been granted shall guarantee for a period of
four (4) years the restoration of the ROW in the area where the ROW user conducted
excavation. During this period the ROW user shall, upon notification from the Director, correct
all restoration work to the extent necessary as required by the Director. Said work shall be
completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of
the Director's notice unless otherwise permitted by the Director. If a ROW user fails to restore
the ROW within the time specified, the City may perform the work and the ROW user shall be
responsible for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual restoration costs within thirty (30)
days of invoice. The Director may extend the cure period on good cause shown.
A ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete the necessary right-of-way
restoration and maintenance because of the existence of any performance bond required by
this Article.
Any person performing ROW work shall provide written notice to all property owners within one
hundred eighty-five (185) feet of the site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any installation,
replacement or expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of

Indemnification — Penalties.
[Ord. No. 3290 §1(B), 10-23-2007]
Performance And Maintenance Bonds.
Prior to any ROW work a ROW user shall establish in the City's favor a performance and
maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the Director to ensure the restoration of
the rights-of-way. The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a period of twenty-four
(24) months following completion of the work. The Director shall have the authority to extend
the maintenance bond period for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months. The Director
may waive this requirement when the work involves no or only minor disruption or damage to
the rights-of-way. The Director shall waive this requirement when the ROW user has twentyfive
million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a history of noncompliance
with State and local regulations.
If a ROW user fails to complete the ROW work in a safe, timely and competent manner or if
the completed restorative work fails without remediation within the time period for the bond
(as determined by the Director), then after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure there
shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any
damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the
ROW user and the cost of completing work within or restoring the rights-of-way, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The City may also
recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund or letter of credit
where such amount exceeds that available under a security fund or letter of credit.
Upon completion of ROW work to the satisfaction of the Director and upon lapse of the bond
period, including any extension by the Director, the City shall release the bond.
The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of insurance in Best's Key
Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the City's attorney
and shall contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be cancelled or allowed to lapse until sixty (60) days after receipt by the
City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond
of intent to cancel or not to renew."

In lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in the City's favor such other
security as the Director may determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding
requirements including, but not limited to, an annual bond to be maintained in the minimum
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).
Insurance.
All ROW users shall maintain, for the duration of any ROW work and, when applicable, for as
long as the ROW user has facilities within the rights-of-way, at least the following liability
insurance coverage: Workers' Compensation and employer liability insurance to meet all
requirements of Missouri law and commercial general liability insurance with respect to the
construction, operation and maintenance of the facilities and the conduct of the ROW user's
business in the City in the minimum amounts of:
Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for property damage resulting from any one (1)
accident;
Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal bodily injury or death resulting from any
one (1) accident; and
Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.
These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit the liability of
any person or to impose any liability on the City or to waive any sovereign
immunity.
All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business in the State of Missouri
with an "A" or better rating of insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty
Edition and in a form approved by the City.
All insurance policies shall be available for review by the City and a ROW user having
facilities within the rights-of-way shall keep on file with the City current certificates of
insurance.
All general liability insurance policies shall name the City, its officers, boards, board members,
commissions, commissioners, agents and employees as additional insureds and shall further
provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30)
days' prior written notice thereof has been given to the Director. A ROW user shall not cancel
any required insurance policy without submission of proof that it has obtained alternative
insurance that complies with this Article.
The Director may exempt in writing from these insurance requirements any self-insured ROW
user, provided that the ROW user demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that the ROW
user's self-insurance plan is commensurate with said requirements and that the ROW user
has sufficient resources to meet all potential risks, liabilities and obligations contemplated by
the requirements of this Article. The Director may require a security fund or letter of credit as
a condition to a self-insured's exemption. The Director shall waive this requirement when the
ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a
history of non-compliance with applicable regulatory law.
Indemnification.
Any ROW user granted a ROW permit and any person having facilities within the rights-ofway,
as partial consideration for the privilege granted, shall, at its sole cost and expense,
indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City, its officials, boards, board members,
commissions, commissioners, agents and employees against any and all claims, suits,
causes of action, proceedings and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of:
Any ROW work including, but not limited to, the construction, maintenance, repair or
replacement of the facilities,

The foregoing indemnity provisions include, but are not limited to, the City's reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceeding prior to the
person assuming such defense. The City shall notify a person of claims and suits within
seven (7) business days of its actual knowledge of the existence of such claim, suit or
proceeding. Once a person assumes such defense, the City may at its option continue to
participate in the defense at its own expense.

indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts attributable to: (a) the City's own
negligence, willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, or (b) The City acting in a
proprietary capacity to deliver service(s) within the City.
Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond or otherwise does
not limit a person's duty to indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a
person of amounts owed to the City or in any respect prevent the City from exercising any
other right or remedy it may have.
Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this Article shall, upon conviction by the City's
Municipal Court, be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by

Section 505.260. Miscellaneous.
[Ord. No. 3290 §1(B), 10-23-2007]
After the completion of ROW work the ROW user shall provide to the City as-built drawings, maps
or other comparable records as determined by the Director, drawn to scale and certified to the City
as reasonably depicting the location of all facilities constructed pursuant to the ROW permit. Such
records may be provided to the Director in the form maintained by the ROW user, but when
available to the ROW user, shall be submitted in automated formats that are compatible with City
systems, as determined by the Director, or in hard copy otherwise.
Upon failure of a ROW user to commence, pursue or complete any ROW work required by law or
by the provisions of this Article to be done in any street within the time prescribed and to the
reasonable satisfaction of the City, the City may, at its option, after thirty (30) days' notice, cause
such work to be done and the ROW user shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized
amounts reported by the City to the ROW user within thirty (30) days after receipt of such itemized
report.
Upon ten (10) days' written notice and with the supervision of the City or as otherwise provided by
law, a ROW user shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang rights-of-way of the City so as
to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with its facilities, at its own expense
subject to the supervision and direction of the City. Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the
trimming of trees on private property without permission of the property owner. All cut materials
shall be properly disposed.
During ROW work by a ROW user the City shall have the right to install and to thereafter maintain
at its own cost in any excavation to or other applicable disturbance of the ROW any parallel
facilities of its own that do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of other facilities.
Interference With Public Projects. Nothing in this Article shall be in preference or hindrance to the
right of the City and any board, authority, commission or public service corporation of the City to
use or occupy the rights-of-way or to perform or carry on any public works or public improvements
of any description.
Section 505.270. Curb Cuts On Designated Streets.

If it is physically impractical to afford access from a residential lot fronting on a designated street to
another street, only one (1) curb cut sufficient to provide necessary access on designated streets
shall be authorized.
Where more than one (1) curb cut lawfully exists on lots fronting on designated streets at the time
of passage of this Section, those curb cuts may be maintained.
Variances from this Section may be requested from the Board of Aldermen in accordance with
Section 410.070 of the Subdivision Regulations. Those requiring variances must establish
hardship outweighing the City's interest in protecting public safety along designated streets, on
which there is heavy through and local traffic and which are inherently more dangerous than local
streets.

Subject to the provisions of this Subsection and Sections 67.5110 to 67.5121, RSMo., (while
in effect), a wireless provider may, as a permitted use not subject to zoning review or
approval, collocate small wireless facilities and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace
utility poles along, across, upon, and under the right-of-way, except that the placement in the
right-of-way of new or modified utility poles in single-family residential zoning districts or areas
zoned as historic as of August 28, 2018, shall remain subject to any applicable zoning
requirements that are consistent with Sections 67.5090 to 67.5103, RSMo., including but not
limited to requirements for underground utilities as set forth in Article II of Chapter 505. Small
wireless facilities collocated outside the right-of-way in property not zoned primarily for singlefamily
residential use shall be classified as permitted uses and not subject to zoning review or
approval. Such small wireless facilities and utility poles shall be installed and maintained as
not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such right-of-way or obstruct the
legal use of such right-of-way by the City, other governmental authorities or other authorized
right-of-way users.
A wireless provider must obtain a permit pursuant to this Chapter, with such reasonable
conditions as may be imposed by the City, for work in a right-of-way that will involve
excavation, affect traffic patterns, obstruct traffic in the right-of-way, or materially impede the
use of a sidewalk.
Each new, replacement, or modified utility pole installed in the right-of-way shall not exceed
the greater of ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole in place as of
January 1, 2019, located within five hundred (500) feet of the new pole in the same right-ofway,
or fifty (50) feet above ground level. New small wireless facilities in the right-of-way shall
not extend more than ten (10) feet above an existing utility pole in place as of August 28,
2018, or for small wireless facilities on a new utility pole, above the height permitted for a new
utility pole. A new, modified, or replacement utility pole that exceeds these height limits shall

be subject to all applicable zoning requirements that apply to other utility poles as set forth in
the Municipal Code to the extent consistent with Sections 67.5090 to 67.5103, RSMo.
A wireless provider shall be permitted to replace decorative poles when necessary to
collocate a small wireless facility, but any replacement pole shall reasonably conform to the
design aesthetics of the decorative pole or poles being replaced, as determined by the
Planning Director.
Subject to Subsection (D)(3) below, and except for facilities excluded from evaluation for
effects on historic properties under 47 C.F.R. Section 1.1307(a)(4) of the Federal
Communications Commission rules, a wireless provider must use appropriate and
reasonable, technically feasible, non-discriminatory, and technologically neutral design or
concealment measures in a historic district, as determined by the City Planner. Any such
design or concealment measures shall not have the effect of prohibiting any provider's
technology, nor shall any such measures be considered a part of the small wireless facility for
purposes of the size restrictions in the definition of small wireless facility.
Small wireless facility collocations shall not interfere with or impair the operation of existing
utility facilities, or City or third-party attachments. A wireless provider shall repair all damage
to the right-of-way directly caused by the activities of the wireless provider in the right-of- way
and shall return the right-of-way to its functional equivalence before the damage under the
competitively neutral, reasonable requirements and specifications of the City. If the wireless
provider fails to make the repairs required by the City within a reasonable time after written
notice, the City may make those repairs and charge the wireless provider the reasonable,
documented cost of such repairs.
Permits For Poles In Right-Of-Way And Wireless Facilities In All Locations.

individual applications for approval of more than fifty (50) small wireless facilities or
consolidated applications for approval of more than seventy-five (75) small wireless
facilities within a fourteen-day period, whether from a single applicant or multiple
applicants, the City may, upon its own request, obtain an automatic thirty-day
extension for any additional collocation or replacement or installation application
submitted during that fourteen-day period or in the fourteen-day period immediately
following the prior fourteen-day period. The City shall promptly communicate its
request to each affected applicant. In rendering a decision on an application for
multiple small wireless facilities, the City may approve the application as to certain
individual small wireless facilities while denying it as to others based on applicable
requirements and standards, including those identified in this subsection. The City's
denial of any individual small wireless facility or subset of small wireless facilities
within an application shall not be a basis to deny the application as a whole.
Installation or collocation for which a permit is granted under this Subsection shall be
completed within one (1) year after the permit issuance date unless the City and the
applicant agree to extend this period, or the applicant notifies the City that the delay is
caused by a lack of commercial power or communications transport facilities to the site;
Approval of an application authorizes the applicant to:
Undertake the installation or collocation; and

Abandoned small wireless facilities shall be removed as provided in this Code or an
agreement, as applicable;
In determining whether sufficient capacity exists to accommodate the attachment of a
new small wireless facility, the City shall take into account that any grant of access
hereunder shall be subject to a reservation to reclaim such space, when and if needed, to
meet a core utility purpose or documented plan projected at the time of the application
pursuant to a bona fide development plan; and
In emergency circumstances that result from a natural disaster or accident, the City may
require the owner or operator of a wireless facility to immediately remove such facility if
the wireless facility is obstructing traffic or causing a hazard on the City's roadway. In the
event that the owner or operator of the wireless facility is unable to immediately remove
the wireless facility, the City may remove the wireless facility from the roadway or other
position that renders the wireless facility hazardous. Under these emergency
circumstances, the City shall not be liable for any damage caused by removing the
wireless facility and may charge the owner or operator of the wireless facility the City's
reasonable expenses incurred in removing the wireless facility.
A permit is not required for:
Routine maintenance on previously permitted small wireless facilities;
The replacement of small wireless facilities with small wireless facilities that are the same
or smaller in size, weight, and height; or
The installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless
facilities that are strung on cables between utility poles, in compliance with applicable
codes.
For work described in Subdivisions (a) and (b) of this Subsection that involves different
equipment than that being replaced, the wireless services provider shall submit a description
of such new equipment so that the City may maintain an accurate inventory of the small
wireless facilities at that location.
No approval for the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a small wireless
facility under this Section shall be construed to confer authorization for the provision of cable
television service, or installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a wireline backhaul
facility or communications facility, other than a small wireless facility, in the right-of-way.
A municipal electric utility shall not require an application for the installation, placement,
maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are strung on cables
between utility poles, in compliance with applicable codes.
Collocations On City Poles And Wireless Support Structures Outside Of Right-Of-Way.
This Subsection only applies to collocations on City poles and wireless support structures that
are located outside the right-of-way.
Subject to Subdivision (3) of this Subsection, the City shall authorize the collocation of small
wireless facilities on City wireless support structures and poles to the same extent, if any, that
it permits access to such structures for other commercial projects or uses. Such collocations
shall be subject to reasonable and non-discriminatory rates, fees, and terms as provided in an
agreement between the City, or its agent, and the wireless provider in a form approved by the
Board of Aldermen.
The City shall not enter into an exclusive agreement with a wireless provider concerning City
poles or wireless support structures, including stadiums and enclosed arenas, unless the

itself, an affiliate, or any other entity; or
The wireless provider allows other wireless providers to collocate small wireless facilities,
on reasonable and non-discriminatory rates and terms, as to itself, an affiliate, or any
other entity.
When determining whether a rate, fee, or term is reasonable and non-discriminatory for the
purposes of this Subsection, consideration may be given to any relevant facts, including
alternative financial or service remuneration , characteristics of the proposed equipment or
installation, structural limitations, or other commercial or unique features or components.
Collocations On City Poles Within The Right-of-Way.
The provisions of this Subsection apply to collocations on City poles within the right-of-way by
a wireless provider.
Neither the City nor any person owning, managing, or controlling City poles in the right-of-way

The City shall allow the collocation of small wireless facilities on its poles using the process
set forth in Subsection (D) of this Section.
An application shall include engineering and construction drawings, as well as plans and
detailed cost estimates for any make-ready work as needed, for which the applicant shall be
solely responsible.
Make-ready work shall be addressed as follows, unless the City (or its successor) and the
applicant agree to different terms in a pole attachment agreement:
The rates, fees, and terms and conditions for the make-ready work to collocate on a City
pole shall be non-discriminatory, competitively neutral, and commercially reasonable, and
shall comply with Sections 67.5110 to 67.5121, RSMo.;
Unless the City allows the applicant to perform any make-ready work, the City shall
provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to
support the requested collocation by a wireless provider, including pole replacement if
necessary, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a complete application. If applicable,
make-ready work, including any pole replacement, shall be completed by the City within
sixty (60) days of written acceptance of the good faith estimate and advance payment by
the applicant. The City may require replacement of its pole on a non-discriminatory basis
for reasons of safety and reliability, including a demonstration that the collocation would
make the pole structurally unsound, including, but not limited to, if the collocation would
cause a utility pole to fail a crash test; and
The person owning, managing, or controlling the City pole shall not require more makeready
work than required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for makeready
work shall not include costs related to preexisting or prior damage or noncompliance
unless the City had determined, prior to the filing of the application, to
permanently abandon and not repair or replace the structure. Fees for make-ready work,
including any pole replacement, shall not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to
other communications service providers for similar work, and shall not include third party
fees, charges, or expenses, except for amounts charged by licensed contractors actually
performing the make-ready work.

expressly exempted in Section 605.040 herein or by State Statute. A separate license must be
obtained for each merchant, manufacturer, business, occupation or trade required by this Chapter
to be licensed. A business license shall not be construed to permit the business, occupation,
trade, merchant or manufacturer to which the license is issued to conduct operations at more than
one (1) store, office, plant or location at the same time within the City. A merchant, manufacturer,
business, occupation or trade which operates at more than one (1) location is required to obtain a

fee shall be equal to the sum of all the fees for each operation so licensed. If the License Official
finds that a single licensee's business activity in the City is mixed, but that one (1) type of activity

incidental, the License Official, in his/her discretion, may characterize the licensee in accordance
with the predominant activity.
Single License To Two (2) Or More Persons Engaged In One (1) Business. A single license may
be issued to two (2) or more persons, corporations, partnerships, or other forms of business

enterprise or venture.

business, occupation or trade until all of its financial obligations to the City have been paid.
Financial obligations include, but are not limited to, personal property taxes, other license fees,
sewer service fees, permit fees or inspection fees, which are required to be paid by such
merchant, manufacturer, business, occupation or trade to the City.
Appeals. Appeals from any determination of the License Official shall be made in the first (1st)
instance to the License Official with evidence that the License Official's initial determination was
incorrect, and then to the Board of Aldermen.
Display. Each licensee shall display his/her or its City business license in a conspicuous place at
the location of operations authorized to be conducted by such license.
Recovery Of Collection Costs. If a merchant, manufacturer, business, occupation or trade fails to
apply for and obtain a business license as required by this Chapter, then, in addition to any other

PEG access facilities existing on August 27, 2007 shall continue until the date of franchise
expiration (ignoring any termination by notice of issuance of a video service authorization) or

obligation to support PEG access facilities as the incumbent cable operator, but if there is more
than one (1) incumbent, then the incumbent with the most subscribers as of August 27, 2007.
Such obligation shall be prorated, depending on the nature of the obligation, as provided in
