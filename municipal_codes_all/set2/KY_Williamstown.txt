The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or sent via facsimile to the City Clerk/Treasurer's office. (KRS 61.872 (2))

Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the City Clerk/Treasurer for the inspection. No person shall remove original copies of public records from the offices of any public agency without the written permission of the official custodian of the record. (KRS 61.872(1).
(C) An applicant may inspect public records during the regular business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or principle place of business is outside of the county in which the city is located and he has precisely described public records which are available within the city. If the person requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed, the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the cost of mailing. KRS 61.872(3).
(D) The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the public records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by this chapter. When copies are requested, the custodian may require a written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in § 33A.01.
(E) Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency currently maintains the records in electronic format.

If the public agency maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the public agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized request.
(KRS 61.874(1))
(G) Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a specified fee. The fee may be based on the cost to the public agency of media, mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy of the public record or records or the cost to the public agency of the creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public records.
(KRS 61.874 (4))
(H) It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a public record for a:
(1) Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if a certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or
(2) Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or
(3) Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the use of the public record for a commercial purpose.

If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public records, not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date on which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.
(KRS 61.872(5))
§ 33A.08 REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.
If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing voluminous public records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or mail copies thereof. However, refusal under this section must be sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (KRS 61.872(6))
§ 33A.09 TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.
(A) The official custodian, upon any request for records made under this chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the person making the request within the three-day period of its decision. Any agency response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific exception authorizing
the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the
exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued
by the official custodian or under his authority and shall constitute final agency action.

In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action. (KRS 61.880, 61.882)
§ 33A.10 CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.

Unless exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a decision is made to take no action.

(B) Who may apply for warrant:
(1) Whenever a law requires or authorizes an inspection or investigation of any place or thing, the administrative officer charged to enforce that law, acting in the course of his or her official duties, may apply for an administrative search warrant. For this purpose, “ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER” includes a building inspector, code enforcement officer, fire chief, their deputies, or other duly authorized representative, as the case may be.

(d) State the basis upon which sufficient cause exists to search or inspect for violations of the ordinance or regulation specified.
(D) Grounds for issuance.
(1) An administrative search warrant may issue upon a showing that probable cause for the inspection or investigation exists and that the other requirements for granting the warrant are satisfied. Probable cause may be shown by:

(b) A reasonable administrative inspection program exists regarding the condition of the property and that the proposed inspection comes within that program;
(c) A health, public protection or safety ordinance, regulation, rule, standard or order and that specific evidence of a condition or nonconformity exists with respect to the particular location; and
(d) An investigation is reasonably believed to be necessary in order to determine or verify the condition of the location.

(2) Except as provided in the following sentence, in executing a search warrant the person authorized to execute it shall before entry make a reasonable effort to present credentials, authority and purpose to an occupant or person in possession of the location designated in the warrant and show him or her the warrant or a copy thereof upon request. In executing a search warrant, the person authorized to execute the warrant need not inform anyone of his or her authority and purpose, as prescribed in the preceding sentence, but may promptly enter the designated location if it is at the time occupied or not in the possession of any person or at the time reasonably believed to be in such condition, but shall orally announce their credentials and authority to execute the warrant prior to entry.
(3) If any property is seized incident to the search, the officer shall give the person from whose possession it was taken, if the person is present, an itemized receipt for the property taken. If no such person is present, the officer shall leave the receipt at the site of the search in a conspicuous place. The return shall be accompanied by any photographs, copies or recordings made, and by any property seized, along with a copy of the itemized receipt of such property required by this section.

(G) Should such subscriber fail to fully comply with such deferred payment agreement and any payment provided for therein or any subsequent bill become delinquent the City Clerk/Treasurer shall cause a written notice of delinquency to be forwarded to such subscriber and, if the subscriber be a lessee to the owner of the premises, by first notice appearing on the electric bill with second billing and thereafter by regular U.S. mail at the subscriber’s or owner(s) address, or by hand delivery by the utility department or police department with receipt requested or with a door hanger notice hung in a conspicuous place and upon the front door of the billing address, stating the fact of such delinquency, the amount due and that if all over-due payments are not made within ten days the electrical service to the premises involved will be discontinued on that date.
(H) Should such subscriber or any one on his or her behalf fail to comply with such deferred payment agreement and cause all other delinquencies to be paid within such ten (10) day period, the electrical service to such premises shall be disconnected on the eleventh (11th) day after the posting of such notice.
(I) Any subscriber who believes he or she has been aggrieved by the action of the City Clerk/Treasurer in refusing to grant a deferment of payment or that the terms of such deferment of payment are unjust or inequitable may appeal from the decision of such City Clerk/Treasurer to the City Council.
(J) Such appeal and any protest of payment as provided in division
(B) hereof shall be heard at the next regular meeting of the City Council at which time such aggrieved subscriber may present such evidence or statement as may be pertinent to the issue involved and the City Clerk/Treasurer may likewise present such evidence or statement as is pertinent to the issue.
(K) The City Council on hearing all evidence and statements shall by majority vote of the members present adopt a resolution resolving such controversy, and the terms, and conditions of such determination
including the amounts and dates of any payment to be made including the date of termination of service on the failure, if any, of the subscriber to comply with the terms adopted by the City Council, provided that any aggrieved subscriber shall be given a period of five days after the adoption of the resolution in which to enjoin the enforcement of such resolution in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the termination of such service.

§ 50.09 PURCHASED POWER ADJUSTMENT.
(A) The city hereby establishes a purchased power adjustment of the charges for the sale of electrical energy sold by the city to customers both within and outside the city limits of the city.
(B) The city hereby establishes the following procedure for the purchased power adjustment of charges for electrical energy sold by the city to customers both within and outside the city limits of the city.
(C) In addition to the charges for electrical energy established in
§§ 50.01 and 50.02, the rates charged for all energy (all kwh) will be increased or decreased by a purchased power adjustment (PPA). This PPA will be shown on the utility bill and will be solely related to the recovery of actual purchased power costs. The PPA will be determined on a monthly basis by comparing actual purchased power costs to recent historical power supply costs or the annual power supply forecast cost from the city’s wholesale power supplier and budget for variations in the wholesale power market.
(D) The formula for determining the PPA is as follows:
PPA (current period) = Actual purchased power cost - (Recent historical power supply costs or the annual power supply forecast cost from the city’s wholesale power supplier) - budget variations in the wholesale power market.
Recent historical power supply costs or the annual power supply forecast cost used to calculate the PPA will be periodically updated as necessary to reflect changes in the forecast from the city’s wholesale power supplier. Also, the budget for variations in the wholesale power market will be periodically updated as necessary to reflect actual or anticipated variations in wholesale power markets to minimize monthly PPA costs to city retail customers to the extent practical.
(E) For the purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
“kwh.” Total kwh purchased by the city during the previous
period.
“LOSSES.” Distribution losses, in percentage points, is defined as [(Purchases - Sales)/Purchases].
“PPA (CURRENT PERIOD).” This is the purchased power adjustment to the base electrical energy charge for each period.
“PP COSTS.” This is the total cost of purchased power incurred by the city during the previous period, including Cinergy and MISO transmission charges.

The invert of the building sewer at such point of connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion of ground or surface water.
(N) All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code.
(O) All persons working on city sewers with a cleaning rod must
use an approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers. (Ord. 1991-320, passed 2- -91)
§ 51.048 INSPECTION.
(A) The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Superintendent or his representative. All connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
(B) All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye
branch at the public sewer connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after connections at both ends are made and after all pipe is properly bedded and backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is completed, within two weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any leakage of smoke from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be located at test and repaired to stand repetition of smoke test without leakage. When smoke testing is completed, the temporary flow line plug shall be removed and a permanent water tight plug shall be placed in branch of test wye-branch and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six inches above the top of the branch. The Superintendent shall determine the method of testing to be performed.

§ 51.064 SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
(A) Pursuant to the requirements imposed on publicly owned wastewater treatment works by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and later amendments, all Pretreatment Standards promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for new and existing industrial dischargers to public sewer systems are hereby made a part of this chapter. Any industrial waste discharge which violates these EPA Pretreatment Standards shall be in violation of this chapter.
(B) Where pretreatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously, in satisfactory and effective operation, by the owner(s) at his expense.
(C) (1) Any person who transports septic tank, seepage pit or cesspool contents, liquid industrial waste or other batch liquid waste and wishes to discharge such waste to the public sewer system shall first have a valid Special Waste Hauler’s Permit. All applicants for a Special Waste Hauler’s Permit shall complete the application form, pay the appropriate fee, and receive a copy of the city’s regulations governing discharge to sewers of liquid wastes from trucks. All persons receiving such permits shall agree, in writing, to abide by all applicable provisions of this chapter, and any other special provisions that may be established by the city as necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the sewerage system.
(2) In addition, any person holding a valid permit and wishing to discharge to the wastewater treatment plant must submit to the Superintendent a sample of each load prior to discharge. A fee and payment schedule shall be established in the permit to cover cost of the required analyses.
(3) Waste haulers who have been granted permission to discharge to the public sewer system shall pay fees for such discharge in
accordance with a fee schedule established by the Superintendent and approved by the city.
(4) It shall be illegal to discharge any batch liquid waste into any manhole or other part of the public sewer system, or any building sewer or other facility that discharges to the public sewer system, except at designated points of discharge specified by the city for such purposes.
(5) Any liquid waste haulers illegally discharging to the public sewer system or discharging wastewater not authorized in the permit shall be subject to the penalties and enforcement actions prescribed in §§ 51.135 et seq.
(6) Nothing in this chapter shall relieve waste haulers of the responsibility for compliance with County Health Department, State or Federal regulations.
(D) (1) The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d) and (e).
(2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements stated in (D)(1) during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.

§ 51.065 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
(A) Each significant user shall provide protection from accidental and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user’s own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to
the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan within ninety (90) days after the effective date of this chapter. Construction shall be completed within 120 days of approval of plans and notification by the Superintendent. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
(B) Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. The Superintendent shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The Superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals;
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 51.089(E); and
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(C) Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of a damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this subchapter or other applicable law.
(D) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 1991-320, passed 2- -91; Am.

§ 51.066 STATE REQUIREMENTS.
State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter.
(Ord. 1991-320, passed 2- -91)
§ 51.067 CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter.

§ 51.068 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS; STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
(A) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with § 51.068(E) and (F).
(B) When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
(C) When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Superintendent shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(D) A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section.
(1) Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for
pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of paragraph (2) of this section are met.
(2) Criteria.
(a) Either (I) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
(b) Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
(c) Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section.
(d) Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result.
(E) When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Superintendent. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in division (E)(1) below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
(d) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request for equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
(b) Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify the Superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in division (E)(1)(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(d) Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division (E)(1)(a) of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
(3) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Superintendent:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(c) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user’s actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to § 51.062. The industrial user must also be in compliance with § 51.142 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
(F) The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Superintendent.
[Note: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the Superintendent will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by § 51.062 (see
40 CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the Superintendent will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)).
(G) Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)]
(H) Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8)]
(I) Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production- based standard shall notify the Superintendent within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)]
(J) State pretreatment standards. Users must comply with Kentucky and Williamstown codified at 40 CFR 403.5(c).

§ 51.069 MODIFICATION OF FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
Where the city’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by Federal Pretreatment Standards, the city may apply to the Approval Authority for modification of specific limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards. “Consistent removal” shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of the “General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution” promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the Approval Authority is obtained.

(c) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user’s authorized representative as defined in § 51.002 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in division (B).
(e) Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with § 51.089(N) and signed by an authorized representative as defined in § 51.002.
(B) Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by § 51.089(A)(2)(d):
(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
(4) In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the Superintendent.
(C) Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Superintendent a report containing the information described in § 51.081(E)(1)(f), (g) and § 51.089(B)(2). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in § 51.068, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 51.089(N)(1). All sampling will be done in conformance with § 51.089(K).
(D) Periodic compliance reports.
(1) Except as specified in § 51.089(D)(3), all significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the Superintendent submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the Superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
(2) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 51.089(N).
(3) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(4) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in § 51.089(K), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(6)]
(E) Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Superintendent of any significant changes to the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
(1) The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under § 51.081(E).
(2) The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under § 51.087 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under § 51.084 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(F) Reports of potential problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
(3) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in division (F)(1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(4) Significant industrial users are required to notify the Superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
(G) Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
(H) Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
(I) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste-stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste-stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 51.089(E). The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of § 51.089(A) through (C).
(2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (I)(1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(J) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
(K) Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(1) Except as indicated in division (K)(2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in § 51.089(A) and (B) (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs Section 6.4 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(L) Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(M) Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under § 51.061(C). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent.
(N) Certification statements.
(1) Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with § 51.081(F); users submitting baseline monitoring reports under § 51.089(A)(2)(e); users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under

(B) For residential, industrial, institutional and commercial users, monthly user charges will be based on actual water usage. If a residential, commercial, institutional, or industrial user has a consumptive use of water, or, in some other manner, uses water which is not discharged into the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based on readings of a wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s) installed and maintained at the user’s expense.
(C) Excessive Strength Surcharges.
(1) In the event a user discharges wastes to the sewage works having an average BOD content in excess of 200 mg/l, or an average nitrogen content in excess of 30 mg/l, the user shall pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of its wastes.
(2) The following surcharge rates shall apply to each user of the sewage works that contributes excessive strength sewage:
BOD - $0.25 per pound
Suspended Solids - $0.25 per pound Ammonia-nitrogen - $0.40 per pound
(3) The costs of treatment for each pound of BOD, Suspended Solids and Ammonia-nitrogen removed by the POTW shall be reviewed at the time of and in conjunction with the review of the user charge. Surcharge rates shall be revised where necessary to approximate current treatment costs. These rates shall be in effect until the next rate review.
(D) Method of Billing Surcharge.
(1) The excessive strength surcharge shall be based on the following formula, with the total applied to the monthly bill of affected users:
A(D-200) + B(E-200) + C(F-30) X 0.00834 X G = Surcharge Payment ($/mo.) Where formula components are as follows:
A - surcharge rate for BOD, in dollars per pound B - surcharge rate for SS, in dollars per pound C - surcharge rate for NH3-N concentration, mg/l D - user’s average BOD concentration, mg/l
E - user’s average SS concentration, mg/l
F - user’s average NH3-N concentration, mg/l
G - user’s monthly flow to sewage works, in 1,000 gal.
(2) No reduction in sewage service charges, fees or taxes shall be permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the sewage works contain less than 200 mg/l of BOD, 200 mg/l of Suspended Solids or 30 mg/l of Ammonia-nitrogen.

§ 51.113 SURCHARGE FOR DISCHARGE OF UNPOLLUTED WATERS INTO SEWER.
(A) No persons shall discharge or cause to be discharged through any leak, defect, or connection any unpolluted waters such as storm water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or cooling water to any sanitary sewer, building sewer, building drain or building plumbing. The Superintendent or his representative shall have the right, at any time, to inspect the inside or outside of building sewers and require disconnection or repair of any pipes carrying such water into the building sewer. Such waters shall not be removed through the dual use of a sanitary drain sump or a sump pump to building sanitary sewer. Discharge of such waters by a manual switch-over from sanitary sewer to storm drainage will not be an acceptable method of separation. In case both storm and sanitary sewage is present, separate drainage or pumping systems shall be included.
(B) Stormwater, groundwater and all other unpolluted drainage may be discharged to such sewers as are used as storm sewers approved by the Superintendent. Unpolluted cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval of the Superintendent, to a storm
sewer or natural outlet. Under no circumstances shall sanitary sewage be discharged to a storm sewer.
(C) The owners of any building sewers having such connections, leaks, or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of such sources.
(D) Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall pay one hundred dollars ($100.00) monthly user charge/surcharge until such time as the connections, leaks or defects resulting in discharge of unpolluted waters into the Williamstown wastewater system are removed and/or remedied and said person shall be liable under all provisions of this chapter.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 51.135 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
(A) The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 51.999 are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under § 51.138 or 51.999.
(B) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

§ 51.136 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.

§ 51.137 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS.
(A) Consent Orders. The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to § 51.137(B) and (C) and shall be judicially enforceable.
(B) Compliance Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(C) Cease and Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 51.140 TREATMENT UPSETS.
(A) For the purposes of this section, “UPSET” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(B) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of division (C), below, are met.
(C) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(D) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(E) Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(F) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 51.141 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in
§ 51.061(A) or the specific prohibitions in § 51.061(B)(3) through the city if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(A) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(B) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2012-04, passed 2-4-13; Am. Ord. 2013-21, passed 8-5-13)
§ 51.142 TREATMENT BYPASSES.
(A) For the purposes of this section:
(1) “BYPASS” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.
(2) Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(B) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
(C) Bypass Notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(D) Bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under division
(C) of this section.
(2) The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

(A) Performance Bonds. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(B) Liability Insurance. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.

Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user’s expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(E) Public Nuisances. A violation of any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of Williamstown Code of Ordinances Chapter
92 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City of Williamstown for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
(F) Contractor Listing.

seq.
(2) Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§ 51.138 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(C) Misrepresentation; Falsifying Documents. Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or Wastewater Contribution Permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not

(F) Injunctive Relief. When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the Grant County Courts through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(G) Civil Penalties.
(1) A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of
$1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(2) The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(3) In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(4) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(H) Criminal Prosecution.
(1) A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not less than 90 days but not more than one year, or both.

This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(3) A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
$500 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not less than 90 days but not more than one year, or both.
(4) In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be guilty of a Class D felony and be subject to imprisonment for a time period of at least one year but not more than five years.
(I) Administrative Fines.
(1) When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000 and each day the violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2) Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 12% the legal rate of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate 12% per month the legal rate. A lien against the user’s property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(3) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(4) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(J) Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(K) Liability. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by the city’s wastewater treatment facilities by reason of such violation.

If such danger is present, the nuisance shall be abated within 24 hours of notice. Notice shall be served upon persons by certified mail, but if the whereabouts of the persons is unknown and cannot be ascertained by the Director in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the Director shall make an affidavit to that effect, and the serving of notice may be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation for two consecutive days. A copy of the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected by the notice and it shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk.

(F) The City Attorney is authorized and directed to institute such proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court having jurisdiction
over the matter, against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid 60 days after it has been rendered.
(Am. Ord. 2011-16, passed 7-19-11)
§ 92.05 NUISANCE CREATED BY OTHERS.
For the purposes of this chapter, it shall not be essential that the nuisance be created or contributed to by the owner, occupant, or person having control or management of the premises, but merely that the nuisance be created or contributed to by licensees, invitees, guests, or other persons for whose conduct the owner or operator is responsible, or by persons for whose conduct the owner or operator is not responsible, but by the exercise of reasonable care ought to have become aware of.

§ 92.08 CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES.
(A) Prohibition.
(1) Any property within the City of Williamstown which is a chronic nuisance property is declared a public nuisance and in violation of this section and subject to the remedies provided herein; and
(2) Any person responsible for property, who permits property to be a chronic nuisance property shall be in violation of this section.
(B) Abatement procedure for chronic nuisance properties.
(1) When the Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee(s), receives documentation or information confirming the occurrence of three or more nuisance activities within a 90-day period on or at any premises or property, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee(s), shall review such documentation or information to determine whether it describes the nuisance activities enumerated in this section. Upon such a finding, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee(s), shall warn the person responsible for such property, in writing, that the property is in danger of being declared a chronic nuisance property.
(2) The warning shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and contain:
(a) the street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the property;
(b) a concise description of the nuisance activities that exist, or that have occurred on the property;
(c) a demand that the person responsible for such property respond to the notice within ten days of service of the notice to discuss the nuisance activities and create a plan to abate the chronic nuisance;
(d) offer the person responsible an opportunity to abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation; and
(e) a statement describing that the property could be subject to closure and civil penalties and/or costs assessed up to two hundred dollars ($200.00) per day if the property is declared a chronic nuisance property.
(3) The Code Enforcement Officer or his designee(s) shall serve or cause to be served the warning and notice to abate upon the person responsible by certified mail, return receipt requested, or may personally serve the person responsible in accordance with the procedures set forth in KRS 381.770(4) and KRS 65.8825(4).
(4) If the person responsible fails to respond to the warning within the time prescribed, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his/her designee(s) shall issue a notice declaring the property to be a chronic nuisance property and post such notice at the property and issue the person responsible a citation for a civil infraction, punishable by a maximum penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00). If the person responsible fails to respond to the warning, notice or citation, the matter shall be referred for enforcement.
(5) If the person responsible responds as required by the notice and agrees to abate the nuisance activity, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee(s), and the person responsible may work out an agreed upon course of action which would abate the nuisance activity. If an agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activities or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached, the matter shall be forwarded to the Code Enforcement Board or other city enforcement board or agency and any additional appropriate entity or office for appropriate official enforcement action. Provided, that in the event the Code of Enforcement Officer or his designee(s) determine that the person responsible has taken reasonable steps to abate the nuisance activity, the city shall not commence an enforcement action under this chapter, notwithstanding the continuance of the nuisance activity.
(6) It is a defense to an action for chronic nuisance property that the person responsible, at all material times, could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the determination that the property is a chronic nuisance property.
(C) Enforcement and penalties.
(1) In addition to other remedies set out in this section or by statute, should the chronic nuisance property not be abated at the time stated in the notice to abate, the Code Enforcement Officer shall be authorized to issue any appropriate citation. Upon failure of the property owner to request a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board, an order may be issued condemning and vacating the premises or portions thereof to the extent necessary to abate the chronic nuisance property. Any close and vacate order shall be for a period of less than one year from the date of closing and rescind within 14 days of an abatement. If the property consists of multi-unit dwellings, and the nuisance activity has occurred solely within a single unit, the condemnation and vacate order may be limited to the single unit.
(2) Upon the issuance of any order provided for in this section, a copy of the order shall be served on the owner of the property in the same manner as the warning and shall be conspicuously posted on the property.

(D) Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The Mayor shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
(E) In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.

A civil action shall be commenced within l80 days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or § 97.l0(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial, if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the Mayor are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the Mayor and which practice forms the basis for the action in court. Any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter shall not be affected.
(B) The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $l,000 punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the said plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume the attorney’s fees.

(A) Provisions apply unless direct conflict exists. The provisions of this section shall apply unless they directly conflict with a tariff, state or federal law, or the provisions of the applicant’s franchise agreement with the government. This section shall not be interpreted to impair the ability of a party using an annual general permit to perform work under such a permit unless a public safety concern would arise if such work were to be performed.
(B) General application. Upon the written notice of and at the direction of the city, a registrant shall relocate or remove facilities, or rearrange aerial facilities, if required by a tariff,
state or federal law, a franchise agreement with the government, or the Mayor in exercising his or her authority under this section.
(C) Coordination. Registrants are encouraged to coordinate the installation, relocation or removal of their facilities with each other in order to avoid issues with respect to the location of facilities within the right-of-way.
(D) Installation.
(1) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term “INSTALL”, “INSTALLED” or “INSTALLATION” shall mean placement of new facilities within the rights-of-way, including the replacement of existing facilities not covered under an annual general permit. An installation requires the issuance of an installation permit or surface cut permit.
(2) Procedure. The city shall notify the applicant if the city determines that a facility may not be installed as requested by the applicant. Upon determining that a facility may not be installed as requested, the city shall provide written notice to the applicant as early as practicable and in conformity with any specific applicable notice requirement. The notice shall contain a description of the area affected as well as the reason for the city’s determination. The city may issue a permit that is contingent upon certain condition(s) being fulfilled with respect to the criteria contained below.
(3) Criteria. A decision by the government to deny an installation permit or surface cut permit application must be based on at least one (1) of the following criteria:
(a) It significantly conflicts with the location of existing facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or government improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
(b) It significantly conflicts with the timing of other ongoing activity taking place in the same area of the right-of-way, or with a previously scheduled activity;
(c) It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction, reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or alteration of a public improvement, including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights;
(d) It is an above-ground facility other than a utility pole, fire hydrant, or street light that because of its size presents significant public safety concerns or violates guidelines or procedures pertaining to aesthetics that are duly adopted by the council;
(e) It fails to take reasonable measures to disguise or cover the facility as required by the Government pursuant to guidelines or procedures pertaining to aesthetics that are duly adopted by the Council;
(f) It conflicts with a requirement contained in the applicant’s franchise agreement;
(g) It is located in a type of right-of-way, such as a bicycle lane or path, in which the government has made a determination that facilities are not to be installed;
(h) It would threaten public health, safety, or welfare or otherwise constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter; or
(i) The applicant is not otherwise in material compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(E) Reservation of rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the government specifically reserves the right to order the removal or relocation of any facility installed after the effective date of this chapter, at no cost to the government, for which an installation permit or surface cut permit was not obtained.
(F) Preclusion on cutting newly paved surfaces. If any street is about to be resurfaced by the government, on advance written notice from the city, the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or installations of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Registrant shall notify city by July 15 of its desire to perform such extensions, changes, or installations, and may be allowed up to ninety
(90) additional days to complete the work. If any street is about to be constructed, reconstructed, widened, altered, or paved by the Government, upon receipt of final plans from the city, the registrant shall make any extensions, changes, or installations of or to its facilities ahead of such activity. Depending on the amount of such extensions, changes, or installations to be performed, the registrant may be allowed up to one hundred twenty (120) days to complete the work. If the registrant fails to do such extensions, changes, or installations, it shall be precluded for a period of one (1) year from disturbing such paving without the express permission of the city. The city shall only grant such permission upon a sufficient showing by the registrant that undue hardship would be caused if the registrant were not allowed to disturb the pavement and that it shall satisfactorily comply with all other relevant provisions of this chapter.
(G) Relocations. The government shall have the ability to order the relocation of any facility located within the rights-of-way. The government shall not normally direct the exact location that the facility is to be relocated to, but instead shall work with the registrant or permittee as part of the permitting process. There shall be no fee associated with a permit required as a result of a relocation ordered by the Government.
(H) Public projects. Whenever the government shall grade, regrade, construct, reconstruct, widen or alter any right-of-way or shall construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain or alter a public improvement, including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights therein, it shall be the duty of the registrant, when so ordered by the government, to change, relay and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way at no cost to the government so as to conform to the established grade or line of such right-of-way and so as not to interfere with such public improvements so constructed, reconstructed or altered. However, notwithstanding the above, if as part of said public improvement the government orders that facilities that were previously and lawfully located above-ground, to be relocated to underground, the government shall bear the cost for the difference in cost between an aerial and underground facility of the same type, unless an agreement to the contrary is otherwise entered into by the appropriate parties.
(I) Relocation for public safety reasons. If the basis for the government ordering the relocation of a facility is a public safety concern, the registrant shall relocate the facility at no cost to the government.
(J) Relocations to assist in the placement of other facilities. If the reason the government is ordering the relocation is to assist in the installation of facilities by another registrant or permittee, the party seeking to install the facilities shall bear the costs of said relocation, unless an agreement is otherwise reached.
(K) Removal.
(1) If the government requires a facility that is no longer being used to provide service, as defined below, to be taken out of the right-of-way, such removal shall be pursuant to the requirements of this subsection.
(2) Definition. A facility shall be considered to be “NO LONGER IN USE” if such facility has not been used to provide service for a period of one (1) year, or the registrant or the party responsible for the facility has notified the city that it no longer intends to use the facility. If the government determines that a facility is “no longer in use” based on the fact that it has not been used for a period of more than one (1) year, the responsible party may petition the city for a reasonable extension of time based on that party’s desire to use the facility to provide service or to sell or transfer such facility within a reasonable amount of time. Such an extension of time shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(3) Procedure for notification. Any party discontinuing use of a facility shall notify the city in writing of such discontinued use within thirty (30) days. Said notice shall describe the facilities for
which the use is to be discontinued and include a statement as to whether the registrant intends to leave the facilities in place for potential future use, remove the facilities, or abandon the facilities in place. The registrant shall remain responsible for the maintenance, repair and condition of discontinued facilities at all times.
(4) Criteria and procedure for removal. Upon providing reasonable advanced written notice to the registrant or other responsible party, the city may order the removal of any facility that has been determined to be “no longer in use”, if any of the following arise with respect to that facility:
(a) It significantly conflicts with the location of existing facilities or facilities that are planned or permitted for installation, or government improvements or facilities that are planned in that area;
(b) It conflicts with the planned grading, re-grading, construction, reconstruction, widening or altering of any right-of-way or the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or alteration of a public improvement, including, but not limited to, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and street lights;
(c) It conflicts with an approved development plan in that geographic area that requires all or certain types of facilities to be located in certain locations, areas, or parts of the rights-of-way;
(d) It conflicts with a requirement contained in that party’s franchise agreement;
(e) The current location of the facility threatens public health, safety, or welfare or otherwise constitutes a violation of the provisions of this chapter; or
(f) It is an above-ground facility that has been determined to be “no longer in use” for a period of more than ninety (90) days.
(5) Facilities located underground. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the government shall not order the removal of any underground facility unless the surface above the facility is currently being, or will be, substantially excavated, or the presence of that facility causes an emergency or threatens public health, safety, or welfare. In any event, the removal of such a facility shall be limited to that portion of the facility that actually presents an issue.
(6) Cost of removal. The government shall not normally bear any portion of the cost of the removal of any facility, unless it is part of a government project and the costs of such removal are minimal. Depending on the circumstances, the city may order that the party responsible for such facility, the party seeking a permit, or both,
bear the costs and the responsibility of such removal. However, in the
event that the facility is being removed to accommodate the placement
of a non-government facility, the cost of such removal shall be the
responsibility of the party or parties applying for the permit, so long
as the existing facility was lawfully installed. The council may agree,
upon a recommendation from the city, that the Government will share in
the costs of removal or limit the scope of removal based on extenuating
circumstances.
(7) In the event the registrant or other responsible party
elects to abandon the facility in place and the council approves such
abandonment, the registrant or party shall convey full title and
ownership of such abandoned facility to the government in consideration
of the abandonment in place and without the need of the government to
pay compensation to the registrant. The registrant shall, however,
continue to be responsible for all taxes on such facilities or other
liabilities associated therewith, until the date the same is conveyed
to the government.
(8) Should any registrant or other responsible party fail,
after notice, to remove a facility upon the order of the city as
specified in this section, the government may, at its option and in
addition to the imposition of any other remedies hereunder or in a
franchise agreement with that party, undertake or cause to be
undertaken, such necessary removal. The government shall have no
liability for any damage caused by such removal and the registrant or
other responsible party shall be liable to the government for all
reasonable costs incurred by the government in such removal.

the submission of the registration statement or immediately upon the

constitute work being done without a permit, and as such subject to the
levy of fines.
(a) Installation or replacement of wiring on existing

for more than one (1) day or (b) involves more than one thousand

(F) Notification of inspections. If the city knows at the time of the issuance of the permit that it shall require an inspection(s), it will notify the permittee that such an inspection(s) is required.
(G) Denial or revocation. The city, in its reasonable discretion, may deny or revoke a permit for failure to satisfy the material requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the denial is otherwise necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of City of Williamstown.

§ 105.21 PERFORMANCE BOND.
In order to ensure performance, each registrant seeking a surface cut permit must establish a performance bond in favor of the Government to be issued by an entity subject to jurisdiction and venue in City of Williamstown, Kentucky, in an amount to be determined by the city, which shall be in effect for and cover all surface cuts made by that party for a period of two (2) years after the final inspection and approval of the surface cut by the city. In no event shall the amount required by the city for the performance bond exceed the reasonable costs of repairing the activity affiliated with the surface cut permits. This provision shall not apply to the government. In lieu of a performance bond, the city may allow the applicant for a surface cut
permit to deposit with the city an amount appropriate to cover the government’s cost of repairing the surface cut; to be held for a similar period. The government reserves the right to impose additional security requirements as part of any surface cut permit or franchise agreement.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 4-6-15)
§ 105.22 PATCHING AND RESTORATION STANDARDS.
(A) Standards. Patching and restoration of the rights-of-way shall be performed according to the applicable standards and with the materials specified by the city, and at a minimum shall comply with the applicable standard engineering drawing. The city shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the criteria listed below. All edges of a surface cut made to a paved street must be sawed and such surface cuts must be sealed with a sealant approved by the city. In addition, the city must approve all backfill material utilized. In developing any additional procedures, the city shall seek input and participation from the registrants as part of the utility coordinating committee process. In most instances, the minimum standards will apply. However, in certain limited instances, the city may determine that the minimum standards do not adequately protect the government because of at least one (1) of the following considerations:
(1) The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way;
(2) The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way;
(3) The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way;
(4) The remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; or
(5) The surface cut was made in violation of this chapter.
(B) Guarantees. Each party performing excavations pursuant to a permit required by this chapter guarantees its restoration work and shall maintain it for two (2) years following its completion. During this period it shall, upon notification from the city, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 4-6-15)
§ 105.23 INSPECTION.
(A) Site inspection. Any party issued a permit pursuant to this chapter shall make the work-site available to the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times
during the execution of and upon completion of the work. No excavation shall be covered until it has been inspected and approved by the city, if the city has given that party notice of its intent to inspect the excavation. The permittee shall provide the city with advance notice of at least one (1) day when the appropriate portion of the activity is ready for inspection, and if the city fails to inspect after being provided such notice, the permittee may continue to perform the permitted activity. Any excavation that has been covered without a required approval or inspection shall be uncovered for inspection at that party’s expense, upon request of the city. If the construction or restoration does not meet the standards under this chapter, the city may order corrective measures.
(B) Authority of the city.
(1) At the time of inspection the city may order the immediate cessation of any work that it in good faith believes poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public.
(2) The city may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable ordinance, resolution, regulation, standard, condition, or code. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. The permittee shall proceed with the corrective work before undertaking any additional work under the permit. Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the city that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the city may revoke the permit, or for good cause shown, extend the period of time allowed for the corrective work to be completed.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 4-6-15)
§ 105.24 RIGHT-OF-WAY MAINTENANCE FUND.
(A) There is hereby established the right-of-way maintenance fund as a non-reverting operating fund of the government.
(B) The revenues received by the city from all registration fees, permit fees, and the portion of any franchise fee attributable to permitting shall be deposited into the right-of-way maintenance fund to be used exclusively for the repair and resurfacing (but not new construction or reconstruction) of streets, roads and other rights-of-way within the City of Williamstown, the employment of such administrative and inspection personnel necessary to enable the city to carry out its responsibilities under this chapter, and the administrative costs of implementing this chapter.
(C) Amounts shall be paid from such fund only pursuant to appropriations authorized by the Council.
(Ord. 2015-03, passed 4-6-15)
§ 105.25 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
(A) If the government vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a registrant and if the vacation does not require the relocation of registrant’s facilities, the government shall reserve, to and for itself and all registrants having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such right-of-way at any time for the purpose of adding additional facilities, expanding existing service, or replacing, reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.

(B) In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that results in the suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee.

§ 117.020 REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.
(A) Pursuant to KRS 243.075 and KRS 242.185(5), there is hereby imposed a regulatory license fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each license issued by the Administrator. The regulatory license fee shall be 5% of gross sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In the case of retail sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory license fee shall be 5% of gross sales. The regulatory license fee shall be 5% on gross retail sales of package malt beverages. Thereafter, the City Council shall adopt at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate for the regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city. Should the city fail to address the regulatory license fee in any budget, then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last fixed until such time as the City Council shall adjust the fee.
(B) Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the Administrator, and shall be held in a separate account maintained for the purpose of fully reimbursing the city for the estimated cost of any additional policing, regulatory or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any other taxes, fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against a regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to any license fee imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the regulatory license fee shall accompany the license fee return approved for such use by the City Council. The return and payment are due monthly, and more specifically, due by the twentieth of the following month of the gross sales receipts collected.
(C) Failure to pay such monthly remittance by the due date constitutes a violation and will subject licensee to suspension or revocation.
(D) Penalty for failure to file a return and pay monthly remittance by the due date is 5% of the tax for each 30 days or fraction thereof. The total late filing penalty shall not exceed 25% of the fee; provided, however, that in no case shall the penalty be less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(E) Interest at the rate of 8% per annum will apply to any late payments.

(D) The functions of the Administrator shall be the same with respect to the city licenses and regulations as the functions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (“ABC Board”) with respect to state licenses and regulations, except that no amendment to these regulations proposed by the Administrator may be less stringent than the statutes relating to Alcoholic Beverage Control, or than regulations of the ABC Board. No regulation of the Administrator shall become effective until the City Council has first appropriately approved it.
(E) No person shall be an Administrator, an investigator or an employee of the city under the supervision of the Administrator, who would be disqualified to be a member of the ABC Board under KRS 241.100.
(F) The Administrator shall have all authority as authorized under KRS Chapters 241 through 244.

As provided by law, and as used herein, no order of the ABC Board is final until all appeals or appeal times shall have been exhausted. A “final order” of the ABC Board is the order entered by said Board, unless an appeal is taken from the Board’s order, in which case the “final order” is the order entered by the Board upon direction from the reviewing court of last resort in the final order of said reviewing court.

(E) In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall file with the application responses to any additional questions as may be posed or prescribed by the Administrator. The City Council has adopted a statement of guidelines and priorities for the issuance of licenses and, in order to determine the extent to which applications may further or impede the objectives of those guidelines, the Council may, by municipal order, adopt a questionnaire to be submitted to applicants for licenses. Upon adoption of the questionnaire, it shall become a part of the application process. The initial questionnaire adopted by the City Council is a part of this chapter and incorporated herein. The questionnaire may be altered, expanded, supplemented or replaced by municipal order of the Council hereafter. In addition to the information contained in the application and any city ordered questionnaire, the Administrator may require such other information as the Administrator may in his or her discretion deem desirable, reasonable or appropriate to the consideration of the application. (Ord. 2016-02, passed 3-17-16; Am. Ord. 2016-22, passed 7-19-16; Am. Ord. 2017-15, passed 12-19-17)
§ 117.042 OTHER CONDITIONS.
In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or permitted by law:
(A) The Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her place of business shall have been approved by the City Building Inspector, and any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky Building Code, the local Zoning Administrator or Fire Department;
(B) All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the Administrator; and
(C) No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due the city at the time of issuing the license, nor shall any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or fees due the city. Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes or any fees due the city at any time during the license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to revocation or suspension.
(D) No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the Administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or any state ABC administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application
or proposed application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending before such officer. This division (D) is not intended to stifle expressions of opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC Administrators are public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law, both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes, threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions under this section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order or revocation or suspension, where the ordinance and applicable statutes allow for such payments in settlement.

(A) If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall be filed with the Administrator within ten days of the change.
(B) Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership changes in such organizations be reported to the Administrator. The Administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic beverage license.
(1) As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other business organization herein, the word “change” is construed to include any change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures 10% of the outstanding ownership or stock.

with the Administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified statement no less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting forth these facts, and the Administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not by payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a new location.
(B) The renewal by the Administrator of the license shall not be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee.

§ 117.048 PROCEEDINGS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE; NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO CONTEST; APPEAL; EFFECT OF REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
(A) Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any law enforcement officer or of the Administrator, the Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any
license granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing. Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or in amendment of the application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or claimed.
(B) The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Council by municipal order. Such order shall be maintained on file in the office of the Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of proposed revocation or suspension sent to a licensee.

A notice mailed to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once surrender his or her license to the Administrator. If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of Police at the request of the Administrator shall immediately cause one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the Administrator.
(E) When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may, with prior approval of the Administrator, dispose of and transfer his or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.
(F) Appeal from the decision of the Administrator revoking or suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
(G) If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this license.

§ 117.052 REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.
(a) Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this Chapter shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a minimum percentage of the applicant’s business income is earned from the sale of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated with the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee’s acceptance of a license to manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for filing of reports
notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the conditions of any license requirement are not met during any particular quarter, the Administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the Administrator may apply an accounting period of at least one year in determining whether or not the food sale percentage requirement has been met.
(B) (1) Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon the licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved in the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and regulations of the ABC Board. Such books and records shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by the Administrator and such city employees who may assist the Administrator in his or her review.
(2) For the purpose of assisting the Administrator in enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC Board under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC Board required by statute shall be furnished to the Administrator. (Ord. 2016-02, passed 3-17-16; Am. Ord. 2016-22, passed 7-19-16; Am.

§ 117.053 DORMANCY.
(A) It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.
(B) Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in division (C) below are proved to the satisfaction of the Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the Administrator. If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the Administrator.
(C) The provisions of division (C) hereof shall not apply to any licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the Administrator
a verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set forth herein, and the Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted there under within 12 months from the date of notice to the Administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as the Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his or her sound discretion.

(6) No amplified sound shall be used within a sidewalk café. At no time shall any music originating from any part of the Premises create a nuisance.

§ 119.04 COLLECTION OF FEE.
(A) Every person who admits an individual to a place because of or as a result of the payment of an admission charge shall collect and pay to the Mayor and/or City Clerk the amount of the safety assessment fee imposed and levied. The fee required to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until paid to the City Clerk as herein provided. Any
person required to collect the fee who fails to collect the same, or having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the City Clerk in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether the failure be the result of his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall nevertheless be liable to the city for the amount of the fee, and shall, unless the remittance be made as herein required, be guilty of a violation of this chapter.
(B) The safety assessment fee imposed and levied hereunder shall accrue at the time an individual is admitted to a place because of or as a result of the payment of an admission charge, irrespective of when or by whom paid, and shall be reported and remitted by the person responsible for the collection of the fee to the City Clerk on or before the twentieth day (20th) of the month next succeeding the end of that month in which the fee accrued.
(C) Whenever the safety assessment fee is imposed and levied on the admission charges to a place where an event or group or series of events, of a temporary or transitory nature as determined by the City Clerk is being held, the report and remittance of the safety assessment fee shall be made upon the conclusion of the performance or exhibition or upon the conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions. In such a case, it shall be the responsibility of the owner, lessee, or custodian of the place where the event or group or series of events is held to report and remit the fee levied and imposed by this chapter to the City Clerk unless a certificate of registration, as provided for in the next succeeding section of this chapter, has been issued to the person conducting the event or group or series of events. The City Clerk, however may require the person conducting the event or group or series of events to furnish a bond to insure that each person makes the report and remittance of any fee due.
(D) The payment or remittance of the fee collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the City Clerk, but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting and paying the fee from liability for payment and remittance of the fee to the City Clerk unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person responsible for the collection of any payment for admissions shall complete such forms and shall submit such information as the City Clerk may require, showing the amount of the safety assessment fee for which he is liable, and shall sign and submit the same to the City Clerk with a remittance for the amount. Where warranted by a person's collection procedures applicable to gross admissions receipts, a reasonable estimate of the receipts may be used as the basis for the monthly remittance of the fee. If the estimate is used it must be clearly indicated on the return and a final reconciliation reporting the true gross admission receipts and the adjusted fee liability shall be included within the person's final remittance under his current certificate of registration.
(E) If the fee imposed and levied by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added as a penalty a sum of money amounting to one percent (1%) of the unpaid fee liability for each month or part thereof from the time the fee was due and payable. For good cause shown, the City Clerk may waive the penalty.
(F) The Mayor and/or City Clerk shall have, at reasonable times during normal business hours, the right to examination and audit of all account books and records of any person responsible for the collection and remittance of the fee herein imposed and levied which, in the City Clerk's opinion, in any way pertain to the gross admission receipts. This audit is to be made by the City Clerk or by accountants employed by the city and at its own expense. If required by the City Clerk, a complete audit of a person's gross admission receipts shall be provided at the end of each person's fiscal year by an accountant approved by the Mayor and at the expense of the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing if, as the result of an audit, the Mayor shall determine that there shall be an unpaid fee liability for a person equal to or greater than one thousand dollars ($1000) per monthly period audited, the Mayor may require such person to pay the expenses of the audit.

(1) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood tosses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(C) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas.
(D) Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; and
(7) Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a special flood hazard area.
(8) Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume responsibility for their actions.

FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.
FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as building utilities, I1VAC components, and the like.
FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in § 156.45 means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Board of Adjustment will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
HAZARD POTENTIAL. The possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing capacity).
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
(1) Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district.

(b) Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC).
(1) Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with State or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the
building to be substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.
(2) ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP.

However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply.
(2) No person, city, county or other political subdivision of the state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or any other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in division (1) above.
(3) Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch, or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so notified. The Kentucky Bureau of Surface Mining through KRS Chapter 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation
of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations.

§ 156.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in § 156.04, the following provisions are required:
(A) Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of
§ 156.31(C).
(1) In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(2) In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations
are determined. Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries(and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
(3) In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
(B) Non-residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be elevated to conform with § 156.31(A) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
(1) Be floodproofed below an elevation one foot above the level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(2) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
(3) Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or;
(4) A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in
§ 156.21(A)(3).
(5) Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in
§ 156.31(D).
(6) All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(a) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
(b) Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
(C) Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(1) Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
(a) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
(c) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
(2) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises
(standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
(3) The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(D) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
(1) All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on sites located within A, AI-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:
(a) On individual lots or parcels;
(b) In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
(c) In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
(d) In substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
(e) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
(f) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
(2) All manufactured homes must be:
(a) Elevated on a permanent foundation; and
(b) Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; and
(c) Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
(3) Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
(a) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
(b) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
(E) Floodways.
(1) Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 156.04, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(2) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
(3) If § 156.31(E) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
§§ 156.30 et seq.
(F) Standards for utilities.
(1) All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
(a) Infiltration of flood waters into the systems, and
(b) Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
(2) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 2010-13, passed 10-28-10)
§ 156.32 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in
§ 156.04, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
(A) No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(B) New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with § 156.04.
(Ord. 2010-13, passed 10-28-10)
§ 156.33 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in
§ 156.04, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(A) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(B) All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.

(Ord. 2010-13, passed 10-28-10)
APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 156.45 APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
(A) Nature Of variances.
(1) The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
(2) It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(B) Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. City Council shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Adjustment.
(C) Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
(1) The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.
(D) Appeals/Variance Procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
(1) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2) Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
(3) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
(4) Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility;
(5) Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally dependent facility;
(6) Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(9) Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10) Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(11) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.
(E) Conditions for Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Williamstown Board of Adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Williamstown Board of Adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter); and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased Hood height, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined
in the definition section under "Public safely and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(7) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.
(8) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 6.3 A through 6.3 E are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(F) Variance Notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $ 100 of insurance coverage; and
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the City Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(3) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(G) Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(H) No Impact Certification within the Floodway. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. 2010-13, passed 10-28-10)
§ 156.99 PENALTY.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no less than
$100, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

1. The board of adjustments may approve, modify, or deny any application for a
conditional use permit. If it approves such permit, it may attach necessary conditions
such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be done before the
request can be granted, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such conditions shall
be recorded in the board’s minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a

set by the board or within twelve (12) consecutive calendar months from date of
issuance, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its original designation unless
there has been a public hearing. Exercised as set forth in this section, shall mean that
binding contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvement has
been let; or in the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is
under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving
substantial investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When
construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in operation in
compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
4. The Zoning Administrator shall review all conditional use permits, except those for
which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall
have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in
order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are
listed on the conditional use permits.
If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use
permit, the zoning administrator shall report the fact in writing to the chairman of the
board of adjustments and to the legislative body. The report shall state specifically the
manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional
9-10
use permit, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time
it is furnished to the chairman of the board of adjustments.
The board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the
time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least two weeks
prior to the hearing. If the board of adjustments finds that the facts alleged in the report
of the zoning administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply
within the time between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the board of
adjustments may authorize and direct the zoning administrator to revoke the conditional
use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on
the land which the conditional use permit authorizes.
5. Once the board of adjustments has completed a conditional use permit and all the
conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and permanently
satisfied, the zoning administrator, upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts
warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the
facts which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the
margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file with the county clerk,
as required in KRS 100.344. Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other
requirements of this ordinance will be treated as a permitted use.

SECTION III
Planned Unit Development Criteria
Development Plan proposals in a Planned Unit Development shall be primarily evaluated against the criteria listed below. The Concept Development Plan shall fulfill the following criteria unless a portion of the criteria do not apply or relate, in who or part, to a specific proposal. The examples listed in this section are for illustrative purposes. Specific solutions used to fulfill these criteria are contingent upon the size, scale, site conditions, design, uses and impacts of a proposed development.
1. Mixed Use Development and Pedestrian Orientation: Planned Unit Developments shall generally have a mixed use orientation (combination of differing types of residential, commercial, and/or industrial uses) both within the development itself and relative to the relationship between the proposed planned development and adjacent sites. The additional intensity allowed in a Planned Unit Development shall only be permitted when a true mixed use and/or an amenity – oriented development with community and recreation facilities as described in this standard is provided.
In general, planned developments shall have a pedestrian/customer orientation, where it is possible to live, work, shop, and play in the same immediate vicinity without a required dependence on the automobile. This may be accomplished through the use of comprehensive pedestrian circulation networks including multipurpose paths and walks along main routes and open spaces such as stream corridors, between major destinations within the development and adjoining areas, secondary walk connections to the multi-purpose paths, the creation of a designed pedestrian environment including street trees in addition to other required landscaping, decorative street lights and other street furniture, and seating areas, and the use of integral curb walks where appropriate along streets. Disruptions in major paths due to street and drive intersections shall be minimal. Additionally, in commercial areas, pedestrian orientation can be accomplished by
placing buildings in close proximity to the street with parking areas to the side and rear of buildings, mixing uses within the same multi-story buildings, building entrances directly facing streets with reduced setbacks, architectural design which employs display windows, projecting signs, and awnings at street level, and designed outdoor seating and gathering spaces at the street level. Each development proposal must demonstrate in detail how the project will be made walkable throughout.
2. Compatibility of Uses: Measures shall be taken to assure compatibility of land uses within a planned development itself and adjacent sites. Such measures may include the provisions of buffer zones, common open space areas and landscape features, transitional
10-38
Planned Unit Development Continued
land uses, or a mixed-use development in which no specific type of land use is dominate. When applicable, the design methods recommended in the “Development Layout, Lot Sizes, and Setbacks” section of the Comprehensive Plan’s Land Use Element shall be employed. Compatibility measures/mitigation measures shall exceed the usual minimum standards of this order when needed to address impacts of the proposed development.
3. Open Space: Useable open space(s), in an amount over and above setback and buffer yard areas and open areas required by the underlying zone, shall be provided. These spaces may be provided in the form of greenways, parks, plazas, arcades, commons, trails, sports courts or other athletic and recreational areas, outdoor areas for the display of sculptural elements, etc. Land reservations for community facilities may be considered in lieu of useable open space. The use of single loaded streets to provide greenways with multi-purpose paths, park areas, or to protect stream corridors, may be proposed for this purpose. Open Space areas are encouraged to have street frontage and visibility. Any site proposed to be publically dedicated or donated for park or open space purposes shall comply with the appropriate legislative body’s requirements for acceptance of such dedications or donations.
4. Multi-Modal Transportation System: Planned developments shall incorporate multi-modal transportation elements through the development, depending on the foreseeable needs of future residents and users of the site, and the relationship of the project site to the community at large. Such multi-modal elements may include provisions for mass transit stops or stations, car pooling lots, pedestrian and bicycle paths and lanes, bicycle parking areas, etc. Multi-modal facilities are encouraged to be combined with the pedestrian systems and open spaces described in Sections 1 and 3.
5. Preservation of Existing Site Features: Existing topography, significant tree cover, tree lines along property lines, cemeteries, and water courses and water bodies shall be largely preserved and incorporated into the project design, where appropriate and consistent with the remainder of this article. The retention of such features may also fulfill portions of the requirements in Section 3 “Open Space” and Section 6 “Landscaping.”
6. Landscaping: Substantial landscaping shall be provided in a planned development with emphasis given to street scape areas, buffer zones, and the provision of significant landscaping (in terms of size of landscape areas, and quantity and quality of landscape materials) within the developed portions of the site. The use of landscape design guidelines is required for multi-phased projects. The retention of existing healthy, substantial trees should occur wherever possible. Properly designed street tree plantings may be permitted to fulfill some landscaping requirements as part of an overall amenity package.
7. Architecture: Sites which are subject to architectural requirements through adopted overlay districts or land use studies shall follow said requirements. For all other sites, a consistent architectural theme shall be provided in planned developments. The theme shall largely use traditional, regionally influenced architectural forms and elements and shall allow variations within it. Traditional styles such as Georgian, Federal, I-House, Cape Cod, Craftsman, Tudor, Queen Anne, Italianate, early 20th century commercial structures, and local farm structures may be used as models. The architectural theme shall
10-39
Planned Unit Development Continued
also relate to existing structures on the project site and adjacent sites, especially if such existing structures are historic.
For attached or multi-family residential developments and commercial or office developments, the predominant building materials shall have a solid appearance, such as could be achieved with brick, stone, and architectural grade cast concrete products designed to replicate natural materials. Roof designs shall have a finished appearance through the use of three dimensional pitched roof forms with architectural grade roofing and/or the use of defined parapets with cornice lines. Long building facades and roof planes shall be interrupted through the use of three dimensional jogs in the building footprint and secondary roof forms such as hips, dormers, and gables. Such buildings shall include architectural detailing for cosmetic enhancement, largely use natural colors, and use a consistent design treatment on all facades. The use of architectural guidelines or building prototypes is required for all multi-phased projects.
Developments should be mixed-use in character with multi-level buildings where commercial services are proposed. Walkability must be planned for when locating commercial and residential uses in proximity to each other. Office and residential uses are strongly advocated above commercial uses in business districts and decrease dependence on the automobile.
8. Historic and Prehistoric Features: Historic and prehistoric features on the project site shall be retained, utilized, and incorporated into the overall project design if physically and economically feasible.
9. Signage: A consistent signage theme shall be provided within a planned development. Building mounted signs shall be the predominate signage on the project site. Signage shall visually correlate to the planned architectural theme by the use of consistent design details, materials, and colors. The use of signage design guidelines is required for multi-phased projects and regulated by Article XIV.
10. Transportation Connections and Entry Points: The provision of transportation connections (street connections, pedestrian paths, multi-purpose trails, sidewalks, and bicycle facilities) shall be provided in all planned development unless physically unfeasible or unsafe. This shall include connections to adjoining properties and developments, and inter-connectivity within the development itself, and contain minimal use of cul-de-sacs or other dead-end types of streets only when necessary. Transportation connections shall account for the County’s adopted Transportation Plan and any adopted greenway, trails, bikeway, and/or pedestrian plans. In addition, the various entry paints (streets, paths, etc.) into a planned development shall be marked or otherwise defined through the use of landscaping, low-key signage on retaining walls, architectural or sculptural elements, archways, markers, etc. Any structures used to demarcate entry points shall visually correlate to the planned architectural theme by the use of consistent design details, materials, and colors.
11. Conformance with Comprehensive Plan: All planned developments shall conform to the
10-40
Planned Unit Development Continued
provisions of the adopted Comprehensive Plan and take into account the limitations of existing or planned infrastructure.

SECTION 16.4 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY FOR EXISTING BUILDING: Upon written request from the fee owner, the building inspector shall issue a certificate of occupancy for any building or land existing at the time of enactment of this ordinance, certifying, after inspection, the extent and kind of use made of the building or land, and whether such use conforms with the provisions of this ordinance.
SECTION 16.5 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY FOR LAWFUL NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES: A certificate of occupancy shall be required of all lawful nonconforming uses of land or buildings created by this ordinance.

SECTION 16.9 PENALTIES: Any person or entity who violates any of the provisions of this ordinance shall upon conviction be fined not less than ten (10) but no more than five hundred (500) dollars for each conviction. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.
SECTION 16.10 INTENT CONCERNING DETERMINATIONS INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: It is the intent of this ordinance that:
A. Where investigation can be made by the zoning administrator or other designated employee, using equipment normally available to the legislative body, such investigation shall be so made before notice of violation is issued.
B. Where technical complexity, no availability of equipment, or extraordinary expense
makes it unreasonable, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, for the legislative body to maintain personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be established for:
1. Causing corrections in apparent violations of performance standards:
2. For protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable administration
and enforcement of performance standard regulations; and
3. For protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for administration and
enforcement.
C. If the zoning administrator finds, after investigations have been made by qualified experts, that there is a violation of the performance standards, he shall take or cause to be taken lawful action to cause correction to, within limits set by such performance standards.
SECTION 16.11 DUTIES OF ZONING ADMINISTRATOR REGARDING PERFORMANCE
STANDARDS: If, in the judgment of the zoning administrator, there is probably violation of the
performance standards as set forth, the following procedures shall be followed:
16-6
Article XVI Continued
A. The zoning administrator shall give written notice, by registered mail, certified mail or hand delivered with a signed receipt, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the
reasons why the zoning administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall
require an answer of correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of such notification. The notice shall state that failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this ordinance.
B. The notice shall further state that upon request of those to whom said notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a qualified expert or experts and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be paid by the legislative body.
C. If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice, but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, he shall note “violation corrected” on his copy of the notice, and shall retain it among his official records, taking such other action as may be warranted.
D. If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within the established time limit, he shall proceed to take or cause to be taken, such action as is warranted by continuation of a violation after notice to cease.
E. If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, but requesting additional time, the zoning administrator may grant an extension if he deems it warranted in the circumstances of the case and if the extension
will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health, or property.
F. If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice
requesting technical determination as provided in this ordinance, and if the alleged
violations continue, the zoning administrator shall call in properly qualified experts to
investigate and determine whether violations exist.
If expert findings indicate violations of the performance standards, the costs of the
investigations shall be assessed against the properties or persons responsible for the
violations in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of
Section 16.9 of this ordinance.
If no violation is found, the costs of the investigations shall be paid by the legislative
body without assessment against the properties of persons involved.

b. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
application. If a Development Plan is submitted with the zoning map amendment , the planning commission shall review said application with regard to the required elements of the Development Plan, and other applicable requirements of this section.

The zoning administrator, in reviewing the Site Plan, may authorize
minor adjustments from the approved development plan, provided that
the adjustments do not: affect the special relationship of structures,
change land uses, increase overall density, alter circulation patterns (vehicular and pedestrian decrease the amount and/or usability of open space or recreation areas, or affect other applicable requirements of this ordinance.

b. That the manner in which the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in the manner equivalent to the use permitted other land owners in the same zone;
c. That the unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequently to the adoption of this ordinance;
d. Reasons that the dimensional variance will preserve, not harm, the public safety and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and
e. That granting the dimensional variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is not conferred by this ordinance to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zone.

18-5
Article XVIII Continued
2. Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with Section 18.2 of this

The board of adjustment shall further make a finding that reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a dimensional variance and that the dimensional variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure, and under no circumstances shall the board of adjustment:
1. Grant a dimensional variance which would vary by more than fifty (50) percent of the applicable regulation when the development is occurring in newly platted areas; and
2. Grant a dimensional variance which would vary by more than fifty (50) percent of the average height, yard, and setback of existing surrounding development when the proposed construction occurs on lots or parcels of land already platted and where more than fifty-one (1) percent of said lots or parcels of land are improved with structures. If less than fifty-one (51) percent of the surrounding lots or parcels of land are improved with structures, then said development shall be governed by the requirements of Section 18.6.
c. The board of adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting of the dimensional variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance as well as the adopted comprehensive plan, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise, detrimental to the public welfare.
5. In granting any dimensional variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance.

18-6
Article XVIII Continued
B. DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE CANNOT CONTRADICT ZONING REGULATION: The board of adjustment shall not possess the power to grant a dimensional variance to permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by this ordinance in the zone in question, or to alter the density of dwelling unit requirements in the zone in question.
C. DIMENSIONAL VARIANCE RUNS WITH LAND: A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the individuals who applied for it. A dimensional variance also runs with the land and is transferable to any future owner of land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site.
D. CHANGE FROM ONE NONCONFORMING USE TO ANOTHER: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without the specific approval of the board of adjustment, as provided herein.
1. The board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on applications to convert or change an existing nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, subject to the following:
a. A written application for a change from one nonconforming use to another (including the required fee as per Section 19.0 of this ordinance) and a site plan, if applicable, subject to the applicable requirements of Section 9.19, shall be submitted to the board;
b. Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with Section 18.2 of this ordinance;
c. The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney;
d. Prior to granting a change from one nonconforming use to another, the board of adjustment shall find that the new nonconforming use is in the same or more restrictive classification of use as the prior nonconforming use. In the determination of the same or more restrictive classification of use, the applicant shall establish and the board of adjustment shall find:
(1) That the new nonconforming use shall generate less vehicular
traffic (automobile and truck) than the prior nonconforming use;
(2) That the new nonconforming use is a nature which will emit less
noise and air pollution than the prior nonconforming use;
(3) That the new nonconforming use will be more in character with the
existing neighborhood than the prior nonconforming use, in that it
is more in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan, and
18-7
Article XVIII Continued
also, more in conformance with the uses permitted in the zone in
which the use is located, than the prior nonconforming use.
e. Any change of nonconforming use granted by the board of adjustment shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance, including, but not limited to: parking requirements, sign regulations and yard requirements, and all other pertinent ordinances of the legislative body.
f. The board of adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at which time its use became nonconforming.
g. The board of adjustment, in granting a change of nonconforming uses, may attach such conditions thereto as it may deem necessary and proper; and the action, limitations and conditions imposed, if any, shall be in writing, directed to the applicant, with a copy to be furnished to the zoning administrator.
h. The change of nonconforming use, as may be granted by the board of adjustment, applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied and, therefore, cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different property.
f. In the case where the change of nonconforming use has not occurred within one year after the date of granting thereof, the change of nonconforming use permit shall be null and void and reapplication to the board of adjustment shall have to be made.
SECTION 18.7 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS: Conditional use permits shall not be issued without the specific approval of the board of adjustment, as provided herein.
A. The board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on applications for conditional use permits, subject to the following:
