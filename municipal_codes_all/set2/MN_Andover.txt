any duty imposed, any penalty incurred, nor any action or proceeding
commenced under or by virtue of the ordinances repealed or the term of
office of any person holding office at the time these ordinances take effect;

ordinance relating to railroad crossings with streets and other public ways, or
relating to the conduct, duties, service or rates of public utilities shall be repealed

any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done,
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or
claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any
such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall
conform to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceedings, so far as

provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party
affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.
B. Extend To All Repeals: This section shall extend to all repeals, either by
express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making
any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
C. Current Pending Actions: Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any
general ordinance of the city herein repealed, and the provisions of all
general ordinances contained in this code shall be deemed to be continuing
provisions and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this
chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any
penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm
or corporation, or as waiving any right of the city under any ordinance or
provision thereof in force at the time of the adoption of this city code. (2003
Code)

of the remaining portions of this code, or any part thereof. The City Council
hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision,
paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any
one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses
or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective. (2003 Code)

1-7-1: DEFERRAL OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR
SENIORS AND RETIRED DISABLED HOMEOWNERS:
A. Legislative Authority: Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes Section 435.193, the
City Council may defer special assessments levied against the homestead
property of a senior citizen or retired disabled homeowner for whom it would
be a hardship to make the annual payments. The City Council will act on all
deferral requests once an application, as set forth in Subsection B of this
section, has been completed.
B. Eligibility For Deferral; Application:
1. Any person sixty five (65) years of age or older or retired due to total or
permanent disability may apply for a deferral of special assessments,
provided the following conditions are met:
a. Homestead: The property being assessed must be the applicant's
principal place of domicile. The classification of the property as homestead on
the county's tax rolls combined with the applicant's name being shown as
owner shall be considered adequate proof that the property is the applicant's
homestead.
b. Annual Income: The applicant's income for the year preceding the year
in which the application for deferment is made shall be as set by Council
resolution.
2. The application, in a form to be prescribed by the city, shall be completed
and filed with the City Clerk, who will verify that the applicant meets the above
conditions. Any additional forms required by the county for recording the
deferral shall also be completed.
C. Interest On Deferred Assessments: All deferred assessments shall be
subject to and charged simple interest at the rate established by the City
Council in the resolution adopting the assessment roll. This interest shall
accrue over the life of the assessment. No interest shall accrue past the date
at which the assessment would have been fully paid if not deferred.
D. Termination Of Deferral Status:
1. Special assessments deferred pursuant to the eligibility requirements set
forth herein shall terminate and become payable, together with accumulated
interest, upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:
a. Transfer Of Ownership: The property is sold, transferred, subdivided or
in any way conveyed to another by the individual for whom the deferral was
granted.
b. Death Of Owner: The death of the owner qualified for the deferral,
unless a surviving joint tenant or tenant in common is eligible for the deferral
benefit provided herein.
c. Loss Of Status: The property loses its homestead status for any reason.
d. No Hardship: The City Council determines that there would be no
hardship to require an immediate or partial payment.
1. It shall be the duty of the applicant, his/her heirs or legal representative to
notify the City Clerk of any event that may affect eligibility for deferment.
2. At the time of termination of the deferral, the City Council may provide for
payment of the deferred amounts in installment payments in accordance with
the original terms of the special assessments. (Amended Ord. 101, 8-18-

A. Background And Purpose: The Minnesota State Legislature has recognized the need for surface water
management programs to preserve and use natural water storage and retention systems and to
construct storm sewer systems for the collection and disposal of storm water. Recognizing that water
does not follow political boundaries, the legislature authorized municipalities to establish separate tax
districts following watershed boundaries for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the
necessary planning and capital improvements for each watershed area. The Lower Rum River
Watershed is a "watershed" as defined in Minnesota Statutes Section 103B.205, Subdivision 11 and
covers a portion of the city. (Ord. 257, 5-4-1999)

River Watershed Management Tax District is hereby established. This district shall include all of the
property in the city within the legally described area as stated in the exhibit attached to ordinance 257
and on file in the office of the City Clerk for public use and inspection. (Ord. 257, 5-4-1999; amd. 2003
Code)
C. Use Of Revenues:
1. All tax levies collected within the Lower Rum River Watershed Management Tax District shall be used
only for the following purposes:
a. Water management planning and regulation;
b. Capital costs of water management facilities;
c. Maintenance and repair of water management facilities; and
d. Incidental costs associated with the purposes stated above.
2. All tax levies shall be used only for those purposes that benefit property within the district. (Ord. 257,
5-4-1999)

may result in altering the terms under which the license is granted. No
work shall be done nor city permits issued for the work until the change is
approved by the City Council. Each day the licensee operates under the
license after beginning construction of the changes and before obtaining
City Council approval shall constitute a separate violation of this article,
resulting in a mandatory minimum civil offense of one hundred dollars

transactions involving pawnbrokers, secondhand goods dealers and precious
metal dealers. The purpose of this chapter is therefore to prevent pawnbrokers,
secondhand goods dealers and precious metal businesses from being used as
facilities for commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply
with the basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the city. (Ord. 104, 5-3-

3-6-1: PURPOSE: The purpose of this chapter is to prohibit massage
businesses and services to the public except those licensed as therapeutic
massage establishments and therapeutic massage therapists pursuant to this
chapter. The licensing regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to
prevent criminal activity and to protect the health, safety and the general welfare
of the people of the city. The purpose of this chapter is not intended to impose
restrictions or limitations on the freedom of protected speech or expression.
(Amended Ord. 110, 8-1-1995)

the city there is a need to license therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists

A. Persons who have a bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic
massage, health and hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary
service to the general public.
B. Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage
establishments and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of
communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation.
C. License qualifications for and restrictions on therapeutic massage
establishments and therapists can minimize the risk that such businesses
and persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the
community.

standardized training in massage can endanger citizens by facilitating
the spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to
unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, and by increasing the risk of
personal injury.
E. Massage businesses that employ persons with no specialized and
standardized training can tax city law enforcement services because such
businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and
other criminal activity than operations established by persons with
standardized training. (Amended Ord. 110, 8-1-1995)

5-1-3: Prohibitions; Measurement of Distance; Penalties; Exceptions
5-1-4: Official map of prohibited locations
5-1-5: Restrictions Relating to Rental Property; Penalties
5-1-1: Findings and Purpose. Repeat predatory offenders present an
extreme threat to the public safety of a community as a whole, and especially to
children. Predatory offenders are likely to use physical violence and to repeat
their offenses. Most predatory offenders commit many offenses, have many
more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of
their crimes. This makes the cost of predatory offender victimization to society at
large, while incalculable, unmistakably steep.
It is the intent of this Chapter to serve the City’s compelling interest to promote,
protect and improve the health, safety, and welfare of citizens of the City of
Andover by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate
in concentrated numbers and where certain predatory offenders are prohibited
from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

CHILD OR
CHILDREN: Any person or persons under 18 years of age, or individuals
under age 21 who are in foster care.
FACILITIES
FOR CHILDREN: All public parks, parkways, park facilities, parkland, public or
private schools, designated public school bus stops, libraries,
group homes, foster homes, day care and child care facilities,

swimming pools, public beaches, youth centers, athletic fields
used by children, crisis centers or shelters, care facilities for
children’s skate park or rink, movie theaters, bowling alleys,
facilities for children’s clubs, e.g. scouting, public recreational

period of four or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in
any month and which is not the person’s permanent residence.
5-1-3: Prohibitions; Measurement of Distance; Penalties; Exceptions.

designee, shall maintain an official map showing prohibited locations of
residences as defined by this Chapter. The City Administrator, or designee, shall
review annually, and if appropriate, update the map to reflect any changes in the
prohibited locations. The map shall not be deemed conclusive or allencompassing
since some prohibited locations change from time to time
including, but not limited to, other places where children are known to
congregate.
5-1-5: Restrictions Relating to Rental Property; Penalties.
A. It is unlawful for a property owner to let or rent any place, structure, or part

owner’s rental license.
5-1-6: Severability. Should any section, subdivision, clause, or other

denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary
to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
B. Procedural Requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The City must notify
the Applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days of the
decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the right-of-way
user may address the reasons for denial identified by the City and resubmit its
application. If the application is resubmitted within thirty (30) days of receipt of
the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The City must
approve or deny the resubmitted application within thirty (30) days after

8-2-19: INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS: The excavation, backfilling,
patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be
done in conformance with Minnesota Rules 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other

cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health,
safety or well-being of the public.
2. The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten (10) days
after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the
Director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Director may revoke the permit
pursuant to Sec. 8-2-23.
8-2-21: WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT:
A. Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the Director
of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The
registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the
emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an
emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two (2) business
days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the
actions it took in response to the emergency.
If the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the
City will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or
potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever
action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
B. Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a rightof-
way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the
normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the City
code, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rightof-
way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
8-2-22: SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION: If the obstruction or
excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on
the permit, permittee shall notify the City of the accurate information as soon as
this information is known.
8-2-23: REVOCATION OF PERMITS:
A. Substantial Breach. The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke
any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the
terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall
not be limited to, the following:
1. The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
2. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-ofway
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the City or its citizens;
3. Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-ofway
permit;
4. The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit
extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
5. The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform
to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec 8-2-20.
B. Written Notice of Breach. If the City determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance,
rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the City shall make a written
demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state
that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial
breach, as stated above, will allow the City, at its discretion, to place additional
or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
C. Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the City with a plan, acceptable
to the City, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the City, or
permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the City, or
permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee
on probation for one (1) full year.
D. Cause for Probation. From time to time, the City may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to,
working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly
outside of the permit authorization.
E. Automatic Revocation. If a permittee, while on probation,
commits a breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will
automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed further
permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
F. Reimbursement of City Costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall
also reimburse the City for the City's reasonable costs, including restoration
costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection with such revocation.
8-2-24: MAPPING DATA:
A. Information Required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the City in accordance with Minnesota
Rules 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within ninety (90) days following
completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide
the Director accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of
all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the permittee. Such maps
and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the City's
electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by
the Director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this
subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's registration.
B. Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules
7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate
means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals
and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director
reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to
the Director evidence satisfactory to the Director of the installed service
lateral locations. Compliance with this Subdivision B and with applicable
Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals
installed after December 31, 2005 shall be a condition of any City approval
necessary for:
1. Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project
including those under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429; and
2. City approval under development agreements or other subdivision
or site plan approval under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 462. The
Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of
providing such information to the City. Failure to provide prompt and
accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in
the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to
the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
8-2-25: LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
A. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with
other applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and
7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to
cities.

between the applicable right-of-way user and the City, facilities in the right-of-way must
be located or relocated and maintained underground in accordance with Section 11-

C. Corridors. The City may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is
or, pursuant to current technology, the City expects will someday be located
within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the
City involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the
proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with
the corridors established by the City shall, no later than at the time of the next
reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move
the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this
requirement is waived by the City for good cause shown, upon consideration of
such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs and hardship to the registrant.
D. Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in
a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance.
The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including,
but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and
restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition.
E. Limitation of Space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the City shall have the
power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the
right-of-way. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the
particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with
respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way,
and future City plans for public improvements and development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest.
8-2-26: PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION: In addition to
complying with the requirements of Minn. Stat. 216D.01-.09 ("One Call
Excavation Notice System") before the start date of any right-of-way excavation,
each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall
mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant
whose facilities are less than twenty (20) inches below a concrete or asphalt
surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish
the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
2-8-27: DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES: When the City does work in
the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
registrant's facilities to protect it, the City shall notify the local representative as
early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to
that registrant and must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing.
Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the
right-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused
during the City's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's
facilities.
8-2-28: RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATON: Reservation of right. If the City
vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a registrant, the registrant's
rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by Minnesota Rules 7819.3200.
8-2-29: INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY: By registering with the City,
or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to
defend and indemnify the City in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota
Rule 7819.1250.
8-2-30: ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES:
A. Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue
all or a portion of its operations in the City must provide information satisfactory
to the City that the registrant's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way
under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another registrant.
B. Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way
shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-ofway
repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement is waived by the
City.
8-2-31: APPEAL: A right-of-way user that: (1) has been denied
registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has had a permit revoked; (4)
believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minn. Stat. § 237.163,
Subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the Director regarding Section8-2-23
Subd. B of this ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or
decision reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council
shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting,
provided the right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to
include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported
by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
8-2-32: RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND PUBLIC POWERS: A
permittee’s rights are subject to the regulatory and public powers of the City to
adopt and enforce general ordinances as necessary to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the public.
8-2-33: SEVERABILITY: If any portion of this chapter is for any reason
held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed
a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this chapter precludes
the City from requiring a franchise agreement with the Applicant, as allowed by
law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

9-7-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE: The City Council finds that certain lands
within the city are uniquely suited for commercial and industrial development by
reason of their proximity to major transportation routes, soil type and quality,
adjacent land uses and market value. In order to preserve the general welfare and
safety of the general public, to promote economic growth and employment
opportunity, to promote orderly commercial and industrial growth and to protect and
enhance municipal investment in commercial and industrial park improvements, the
city finds it necessary to implement controls within the lands zoned nonresidential.

Upon approval of the Andover Review Committee, wood frame
construction may be considered equivalent to masonry. (Ord. 249, 12-1-
1998; amd. 2003 Code)
2. Walls of such buildings facing on streets must be finished with face brick,
stone, glass, wood or their aesthetic equivalent. Any building wall facing a
residentially zoned district shall not be finished with exposed plain-faced
poured concrete or concrete block.
B. Building Design: The building design shall exhibit architectural control that
seeks to be creative and maximize building lines, shades, and angles to
maximize architectural uniqueness. (Ord. 249, 12-1-1998)
9-7-4: BUILDING OCCUPANCY PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF REQUIRED
IMPROVEMENTS: As may be determined by the Building Official, when
circumstances do not permit the substantial completion of required improvements for
a commercial building project, the general contractor, builder or owner may apply for
a Certificate of Occupancy and enter into a security agreement with the city and
furnish a surety as provided in Section 9-1-5 of this Title.
9-7-5: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES: Except as
otherwise provided by law, any nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation
of land or premises existing at the time of the adoption of an additional control under
this chapter, may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration,
maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
A. The nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of more than
one year; or
B. Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of
greater than 50 percent of its estimated market value, as indicated in the
records of the county assessor at the time of damage, and no building permit
has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In this
case, a municipality may impose reasonable conditions upon a zoning or
building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent
property or water body. When a nonconforming structure in the shoreland
district with less than 50 percent of the required setback from the water is
destroyed by fire or other peril to greater than 50 percent of its estimated
market value, as indicated in the records of the county assessor at the time of
damage, the structure setback may be increased if practicable and
reasonable conditions are placed upon a zoning or building permit to mitigate
created impacts on the adjacent property or water body.
9-7-6: VIOLATION; PENALTY: Any person violating any provision of this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor as defined by state law and subject to the
penalties therefore. (Ord. 249, 12-1-1998; Amended Ord. 458, 4-5-16)

of the city, the excavation and repair will not be made until the property
owner requests the city, in writing, to excavate and/or repair the service
and agrees to pay the cost. The owner further agrees to waive public
hearing and be special assessed the cost of such excavation and repair if
the problem is found to be other than the city's responsibility. The city will
make the determination for responsibility for cost of investigation and/or
repair. The matter of whether the dig up is done by city forces or
contracted would depend on the urgency or need of repair and the
availability of city forces to do the work. Recovery by the city for faulty
construction will depend upon the circumstances and the decision of the
city attorney on the likelihood of recovery. (Amended Ord. 55, 5-5-1981)

(Amended Ord. 32, 11-25-1975; amd. 2003 Code)
1 See subsection 1-7-3J of this code.
10-3-3: SEWER RENTAL CHARGES1:
A. Rental Charge: All premises located within the corporate limits of the city
served by the city sewer system shall pay a sewer rental fee to the city
as set forth by ordinance, payable quarterly or monthly for each Sewer
Availability Charge (SAC) unit.
B. Schedule Of Charges: The sewer rental fee for residential dwellings with
city water in place shall be based on the following schedule:
1. Residential Use: For each living unit, the sewer use charge shall be as
set forth by ordinance, payable quarterly.
2. Nonresidential Use:
a. Charges for nonresidential sewer use shall be based upon the
number of residential equivalent connections (RECs) computed for
each building or structure receiving municipal sewage service.
Such computations are to be done as follows: building Sewer
Availability Charge units (SAC units) x 100,000 gal. per yr. divided
by 87,000 equals no. RECs. The charge per REC shall be as set
forth by ordinance, payable quarterly. The city may require a
nonresidential building user to provide a water meter, approved by
the Public Utilities Department, that will accurately measure all
water supplied to the premises. In February of each year, the meter
readings shall be reviewed and one REC assigned to each 73,000
gallons of water consumed in the pervious one year period. If the
number of RECs computed by reference to water usage varies from
RECs computed by the above formula, the charges for that
calendar year shall be determined by reference to RECs computed
by water usage. The city may change the per month charges and
the figures used in computing the RECs by resolution.
b. Each nonresidential user shall be charged a minimum of one
REC. Any fraction thereof of REC shall be adjusted to the next
highest one-half (1/2) REC.
C. Payment Of Charges; Late Fee: The sewer rental charge shall be
payable to the city. A penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added to all
bills not paid by the date affixed for final payment. (Amended Ord. 32, 11-
25-1975; amd. 2003 Code)

sewer rental fee within a reasonable time as determined by the city, said
fee shall be certified by the City Clerk and assessed against the property
connected to the sewer system and forwarded to the County Auditor for
collection. (Amended Ord. 32, 11-25-1975)
10-3-4: INDUSTRIAL USER STRENGTH CHARGE:
A. Purpose And Authority: The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission, a
metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the
state (the "Commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in
compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of
1972 and regulations thereunder (the "act"), has determined to impose an
industrial user sewer strength charge upon users in the metropolitan
disposal system (as defined in Minnesota Statutes Section 473.121,
Subdivision 24) to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment
works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such
sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the
volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay such costs based upon
the strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the
Commission, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be necessary
to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation
thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or
served by the city. Furthermore, Minnesota Statutes Section 444.075,
subdivision 3, empowers the city to make such sewer charge against the
owner, lessee, occupant, or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the
County Auditor as a tax lien against the property served.
B. Charge Established: For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the
city each year by the Commission that are based upon the strength of
discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within
or served by the city, there is hereby approved, adopted and
established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of
discharge, a sewer charge upon each person, firm, or corporation
receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based
upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system in
the city (the "strength charge"). (Ord. 224, 7-1-1997)
C. Formula For Determining Charge: For the purpose of computation of the
strength charge established in Subsection B of this section, there is
hereby established, approved and adopted in compliance with the act, the
same strength charge formula designated in Resolution 76-172 and
Resolution 76-173 adopted by the Commission, such formula being based
upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced
through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an
annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and
maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the Commission.
(Ord. 224, 7-1-1997; amd. 2003 Code)
D. Payment Of Charge; Late Payments: It is hereby approved, adopted and
established that the strength charge established in Subsection B of this
section shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment
services and subject thereto before the twentieth day succeeding the
date of billing thereof to such user by or on behalf of the city, and such
payment thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the
billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby established,
approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date,
an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate of
two-thirds of one percent (2/3%) per month on the unpaid balance due.
E. Delinquent Charges A Lien: As provided by Minnesota Statutes Section
444.075, Subdivision 3, it is hereby approved, adopted and established
that if payment of the strength charge established in Subsection B of this
section is not paid before the sixtieth day next succeeding the date of
billing thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, said
delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established
pursuant to Subsection D of this section, shall be deemed to be a charge
against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the
city or its agents shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the
County Auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as
other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall
not preclude the city or its agents from recovery of such delinquent sewer
strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy.
(Ord. 224, 7-1-1997)
10-3-5: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
A. Notice Of Violation: Any person found to be violating any provision of
this chapter, with the exception of Subsections 10-3-1A, B, C and E and
Section 10-3-4, shall be served by the Building Official with written notice
stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit
for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the
period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
B. Violation; Penalty: Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the
time provided for in the written notice shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished according to prevailing
state laws. Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be
deemed a separate offense.
C. Liability For Violation: Any person violating any of the provisions of this
chapter shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage
occasioned the city by reason of such violation. (Amended Ord. 32, 11-

10-5-7: Payment Of Fee
10-5-8: Recalculation Of Fees
10-5-9: Penalty For Late Payment
10-5-10: Collection Of Delinquent Fees
10-5-1: FINDINGS: The City Council of the City of Andover recognizes that
the control and regulation of storm water drainage is necessary to protect the
environment and the public health, safety and welfare. The Council further
recognizes the state and federal regulations intended to protect the nation's lakes
and waterways will place a significant burden on the city's finances. The Council
therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the city and its citizens for all
contributors to the city's storm water drainage system to pay a proportionate
share of the city's cost in complying with those regulations and maintaining an
effective storm water drainage system. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)
10-5-2: STORM WATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED: Pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes Section 444.075 the city's storm water drainage system will be operated
as a public utility from which revenues will be derived subject to the provisions of
this chapter and Minnesota State Statutes. The storm water drainage utility will
be a part of the Engineering Department and under the administration of the City
Engineer. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)

Single-family rural, estate, suburban and farmstead 0.5
Single-family urban 1.0
For the purpose of calculating the storm water drainage fee, all developed
single-family urban parcels will be considered to have an acreage of one-half
(1/2) acre.
The storm water drainage rate will be established from time to time by
fee schedule by resolution of the City Council. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)
10-5-5: CREDITS: The City Council may, by resolution, adopt policies
recommended by the City Engineer, for the adjustment of the storm water
drainage fee for certain parcels upon which hydrologic data, supplied by the
owner of the parcel, demonstrates a hydrologic response substantially different
from the adopted standards. Such adjustments of storm water drainage fees will
not be made retroactively. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)
10-5-6: EXCEPTIONS: The following land uses are exempt from storm
water drainage fees:

computed quarterly and invoiced through the city's contracted billing service. The
fee will be due and payable with that statement. The property owner will be the
party ultimately responsible for payment of the fee whether or not the owner
occupies the premises. Any prepayment or overpayment of the fee will be
retained by the city and applied against subsequent quarterly fees. (Ord. 271, 6-
17-2003)
10-5-8: RECALCULATION OF FEES: Any property owner or party
responsible for the payment of the storm water drainage fee may, in writing
addressed to the City Engineer, request the city to re-determine or recalculate a
particular invoice for the fee. The city must receive such request within three (3)
months of the mailing of the invoice by the city. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)
10-5-9: PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT: Each quarterly statement for
the storm water drainage fee which is not paid when due will incur a penalty of
ten percent (10%) of the past due amount. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)
10-5-10: COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT FEES:
In the event a user fails to pay his storm water drainage fee within a reasonable
time, said fee shall be certified by the City Clerk and assessed against the
property on which the charges have incurred, and forwarded to the county
auditor for collection. (Ord. 271, 6-17-2003)

be filed or recorded if the land is described in the conveyance by metes
and bounds or by reference to an unapproved Registered Land Survey
made after April 21, 1961, or to an unapproved plat made after such
regulations became effective. This provision does not apply to a
conveyance if the land described:

adoption of subdivision regulations under Laws 1945, Chapter 287,
whichever is the later, or of the adoption of subdivision regulations
pursuant to a home rule charter; or

acres in area and one hundred fifty feet (150') in width on January
1, 1966, or is a single parcel of land not less than five (5) acres in
area and having a width of not less than three hundred feet (300'),
and its conveyance does not result in the division of the parcel into
two (2) or more lots or parcels, any one of which is less than five (5)
acres in area or three hundred feet (300') in width, except land that
is in the Rural Reserve area and is further restricted by the

e. When a property owner, either residential or commercial, wishes
to move interior lot lines and by doing so does not create any
additional buildable lots by moving said property lines, and the
moving of said property lines does not create any lot which is below
the standards for the applicable zoning district in which it lies, such
new property descriptions may be approved administratively by the

compliance by adoption of a resolution to that effect. The conveyance may
then be filed or recorded.

11-3-7: PARKS, PLAYGROUNDS, OPEN SPACE AND PUBLIC USES:
A. Lands For Public Use Required: Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes Section
462.358, as amended, the City Council of the City of Andover shall require
all owners or developers, as a prerequisite to approval of a plat,
subdivision or development of land, to convey to the City or dedicate to
the public use for park or playground purposes, a reasonable portion of
the area being platted, subdivided or developed as hereinafter specified.
Said portion to be approved and acceptable to the City, or in lieu thereof,
the owners or developers shall, at the option of the City, pay to the City for
the use in the acquisition of public parks, open space and playgrounds,
development of existing public park and playground sites, and debt
retirement in connection with land previously required for public parks and
playgrounds. Any park cash contributions for commercial/industrial zoned
property is to be determined as identified in Subsection C. Any park cash
contributions for residential zoned property are to be determined as
identified in Subsection C of this section. The form of contribution (cash or
land) shall be decided by the City based upon need and conformance with
the approved City Park Comprehensive Plans. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord.
355; Amended 1/2/08; Ord. 361))
B. Dedicated Lands:
1. Requirements: Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this
section shall be reasonably adaptable for use for active park and
recreation purposes and shall be at a location convenient to the people to
be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park
and recreation areas shall include size, shape, topography, geology, tree
cover, access and location.
Also land dedication shall be selected based on the parkland need defined
by the Andover Park System Plan. Active parkland areas shall be
exclusive of wetlands, slopes exceeding twelve percent (12%), ponding
areas, or other features unsuitable for active park development. The City
may accept natural open space or passive park containing unique natural
environmental features as part of the parkland dedication. Selection of
1 See subsection 1-7-3G of this code.
park land for dedication shall be at the discretion of the City Council,
based on the policies and recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan
and the Comprehensive Park System Plan. The Council may vary from
these requirements if a development demonstrates unique attributes
sufficient for parks and open space included in the development.
(Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
2. Maximum Area of Dedicated Land: Developers of land within the City
of Andover shall be required to dedicate 10% of land to the city for park, or
open space and playground purposes. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
C. Cash Contribution In Lieu Of Lands:
1. Amount Determined:
a. In lieu of land dedication, the City may require from the
developer or owner a cash contribution which is based on a fee per
lot/unit basis for the development of residentially zoned property. In
the case of the development of commercial/industrial zoned
property, the City may require a cash contribution from the
developer or owner which is based on a rate that is commensurate
with single family residential (using three units per acre times the
current fee per lot unit). These fees1 are established and adopted
by the City Council and are effective for any plat that has not
received preliminary plat approval after the date of publication of
this title. The fees would also apply to plats that have received
preliminary plat approval, but have not received final plat approval
by the City Council. If an extension is requested of the preliminary
plat beyond the twelve (12) months, the fee that is in effect at the
time of the extension is the fee that is to be contributed. Park cash
contributions are to be paid to the city prior to the recording of the
final plat at the county. The City Council may require the payment
at a later time under terms agreed upon in the development
agreement. Delayed payment may include interest at a rate set by
the city. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355; Amended 1/2/08, Ord. 361)
b. If the applicant or developer does not believe that the fees
contained in the city fee schedule (pursuant to this park dedication
analysis) fairly and accurately represent the effect of the
subdivision on the park or trail system of the city, the applicant or
developer may request that the city prepare an in-depth study of
the effect of the subdivision on the park and trail system and an
estimate of that effect in money and/or land. All costs of said study
shall be borne by the developer or applicant. If the developer or
applicant requests the preparation of such a study, a plat
application may proceed as if the fee had been paid, pending a
decision on the appeal of dispute over the proposed fee in lieu of
dedication if:
1. The applicant puts the City on written notice of the
proposed fee in lieu of dedication.
2. Prior to the City’s final decision on the application, the fee
in lieu of dedication is deposited in escrow, and
3. The applicant appeals under Minnesota State Statute
462.361 within 60 days of approval of the application.
If such appeal is not filed by the deadline, or the applicant does not
prevail on the appeal, then the funds paid into the escrow must be
transferred to the City. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
c. If a combination of cash and land dedication is required, the cash
contribution to the city would be determined as follows for
residential zoned property:
Step 1: Total acreage of plat multiplied by ten percent (10%)
(minimum required land dedication) yields the required land to be
dedicated.
Step 2: "Total park dedication fee" will be determined by
establishing the ultimate number of residential lots that can be
achieved (if no park land was dedicated) multiplied by the park
dedication fee per unit as per the fee schedule. (Amended 9/18/07,
Ord. 355)
Step 3: Divide the "total park dedication fee" from Step 2 by the
required land to be dedicated from Step 1. This yields the "fee per
acre". (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
Step 4: Multiply the "fee per acre" from Step 3 by the acres of park
to be dedicated, which is to include one half (1/2) of the street rightof-
way adjacent to the park. The land must be exclusive of
wetlands, slopes exceeding 12% ponding areas, or other features
unsuitable for park land. This yields the dollar value of credit for
land and for the right-of-way being dedicated. (Amended 9/18/07,
Ord. 355)
Step 5: The “total park dedication fee: from Step 2 minus the dollar
value of credit for land and right-of-way being dedicated from Step
4 yields the dollar amount and/or balance due in park dedication
fee. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
Step 6: Credit will be given towards the park dedication fee that is
required for areas within the park that were required to be improved
by the City and agreed to by the developer or owner. Those
improvements may include grading of the park, which must be
graded a minimum of two feet above the 100-year flood elevation or
three feet above mottled soil or highest anticipated water level,
whichever is higher. Improvements may also include, but are not
limited to, installation of playground equipment, installation of
individual sanitary sewer and water service (not the main lateral
lines), and any other item that would relate to development of the
park. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
D. Density And Open Space Requirements: Land area so conveyed or
dedicated for park, open space and playground purposes may not be used
by an owner or developer as an allowance for development as set out in
the city zoning code. The land shall be in addition to and not in lieu of,
open space requirements for Planned Unit Developments pursuant to Title
13, Chapter 3 of this code. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
E. Metes And Bounds Lot Splits: The Park and Recreation Commission
may recommend to the City Council a cash payment in lieu of park land
on metes and bounds lot splits less than twenty (20) acres in size.
Where a cash contribution is required, the owner will be requested to
contribute on a fee per lot or fee per unit as required by City Code 1-7-4
for the lot that is being split. The City will have the right to require park
dedication for any future subdivision of the property. Credit shall be
given for previously paid park dedication. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord. 355)
11-3-8: TRAILS:
Cash Contribution for Trails: The City shall have the authority to require
a trail fee that will be charged at the time of subdivision. The fee shall
be established annually with the City Fee Ordinance and is separate and
distinct from the park dedication fee. The fee’s intent is to fund regional
trails as shown in the Comprehensive Plan. (Amended 9/18/07, Ord.
355)

12-3-1: PURPOSE OF ZONING DISTRICTS: The zoning districts are so
designated as to assist in carrying out the intent and purposes of the
Comprehensive Plan and to control residential densities in such manner as to
adequately provide public services and utilities. The zoning districts are based
upon the Comprehensive Plan which has the purpose of protecting the public
health, safety, convenience and general welfare by controlling the needs for
public utilities, protecting against traffic congestion and accident hazards,
protecting the public health from adverse influences generated by nonresidential
uses, protecting against the danger of fire, conflagration, and other purposes of a
similar nature. (Amended Ord. 8, 10-21-1970, (Amended Ord. 314 10-4-2005)

Amended Ord. 468, 6-6-17)
12-3-3: PURPOSE OF EACH DISTRICT:
A. RR Single Family Rural Reserve: Rural Reserve District is approximately
one thousand acres in size to accommodate future urban growth beyond
the previously planned Municipal Urban Service Area. This area is
designated as an area of which is restricted from urban development until a
master plan has been approved and municipal sewer and water can be
constructed to serve the area. The city prohibits lot splits and subdivisions
of less than one parcel per ten acres to prevent this area from rural
residential development that would preclude orderly MUSA expansion.
However, there are opportunities to allow for rural reserve lot splits of 5
acres minimum in situations which ensure that the majority of the residual
land be preserved for future economical urban development as long as
the provisions of the city codes are met. The intent of the ordinance is to
allow subdivision of land while preserving residual land for future
economical urban development. (Amended 468, 6-6-17)
R-1 Single Family Rural Residential:
1. This district is intended to provide a residential atmosphere for those
persons desiring to retain a large parcel of land. Such large lots are logical
in areas where development into smaller lots would be difficult, or where
public utilities will not be available in the foreseeable future. Furthermore,
larger houses are more costly and require larger lots. Thus, to provide an
area to accommodate those persons with the financial means to erect a
large house, it is necessary to have an area of large lots.
2. Land which is wooded, or which has a changing topography, and low
land which tends to be poor agriculturally is also the most expensive to
develop for residential sites and, after development, the sites tend to be
expensive to maintain. Such areas are the most interesting and most
susceptible to large lot development. The district also is intended to
preserve productive land for agricultural use. (Amended Ord. 314, 10-4-
05)
B. R-2 Single Family Residential Estate: This district is intended to provide a
residential atmosphere for those persons desiring a single-family
neighborhood with a suburban density. Lots in this district created after
1978 and without City sewer and water must be at least 2.5 acres. This
zoning district was used for rural residential developments prior to 1978.
No existing properties may be rezoned to R-2. (Amended Ord. 8, 10-21-
1970; amd. 2003 Code, Amended Ord. 314 10-4-2005)
C. R-3 Single Family Suburban Residential: This particular district is intended
to satisfy those persons who prefer a medium sized lot. Lots in this district
created after 1978 and without City sewer and water must be at least 2.5
acres. This zoning district was used for rural residential developments
created before 1978. No existing properties may be rezoned to R-3.
(Amended Ord. 314 10-4-2005)
D. R-4 Single Family Urban Residential: This district represents urban
density use by single-family detached dwellings. (Amended Ord. 314 10-
4-2005)
E. R-5 Manufactured Housing District: This district would permit all types
of manufactured housing including manufactured homes and modular
houses, provided public sewer and water is provided. (Amended Ord.
8, 10-21-1970)
F. M-1 Multiple Dwelling Medium Density: This district is intended to provide
a location for medium density attached dwelling units (townhouses) with
private entrances. These areas may be transitional, however, the
townhouse resident should have convenient access to all facilities
provided for single-family neighborhoods. This district’s location shall
provide sufficient space for buffering from less intense uses. (Amended
Ord. 8, 10-21-1970; amd. 2003 Code, Amended Ord. 314 10-4-2005)
G. M-2 Multiple Dwelling District: This district is intended to provide a location
for all types of multiple dwellings. This district’s location shall have
convenient access to all facilities provided for neighborhoods, open space,
and buffering from less intense uses. Access to an M-2 district shall be
from a collector or arterial roadway. (Amended Ord. 314 10-4-2005)
H. GR General Recreation District: This district is intended to provide a
location for all types of commercial recreation uses such as golf driving
ranges, outdoor theaters, racetracks, and snowmobile areas, most of
which require large amounts of land and good separation from residential
areas. This district’s location shall provide sufficient space for buffering
from less intense uses. (Amended Ord. 314 10-4-2005)
I. LB Limited Business District: This district is suitable only for commercial
uses of a limited (less intense) nature. This may be due to the close
proximity of residential uses. The LB district can be used as a transitional
district or buffer between non-compatible uses such as intense
commercial (GB) and low density residential uses. (Amended Ord. 314 10-
4-2005)
J. NB Neighborhood Business District: This district is used for retail sales
and services in such scale as to serve the surrounding neighborhood
needs. Locations for Neighborhood Business districts are typically small
plots in close proximity to or surrounded by residential areas. NB zoning
districts do not require frontage on an arterial roadway and can be served
by local and collector streets. However, this district shall not be served
exclusively by local streets. This district’s location shall provide sufficient
space for buffering from less intense uses. (Amended Ord. 314 10-4-
2005)
K. SC Shopping Center District: This zoning classification is reserved for
modern retail shopping facilities of integrated design in appropriate
locations. Locations for the SC district are larger plots that can
accommodate more intensive retail development. Access shall be
available from arterial roadways. This district’s location shall provide
sufficient space for buffering from less intense uses. (Amended Ord. 314
10-4-2005)
L. GB General Business District: These are areas containing a wide
variety of business uses including retail, service and semi-industrial. As
such, they may contain businesses that tend to serve other business
and industry as well as those catering to shopper needs.
M. I Industrial District: These are areas that have the prerequisites for
industrial development, but because of proximity to residential areas or the
need to protect certain areas or uses from adverse influences, high
development standards will be necessary. I district uses include service
industries and industries which manufacture, fabricate, assemble or store,
where the process is not likely to create offensive noise, vibrations, dust,
heat, smoke, odor, glare or other objectionable influences. Generally,
those include wholesale, service and light industries that are dependent
upon raw materials refined elsewhere. An industrial "park" which
maintains high development standards would be zoned I. This district’s
location shall provide sufficient space for buffering from less intense uses.
(Amended Ord. 8, 10-21-1970, Ord. 314 10-4-2005)
N. CLR Closed Landfill Restricted: This district is intended to apply to former
landfills and adjacent lands which are managed under the Closed Landfill
Program of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). The
purpose of the district is to limit uses of land both actively filled and related
lands, to minimal uses in order to protect the land from human activity
where response action systems are in place. This district shall only apply
to the former landfill and pertinent adjacent lands (the limits of which are
defined by the MPCA). This district shall apply whether the landfill is in
public (State, MPCA, County, City, Township), Indian tribal, or private
ownership.
1. Permitted Uses
Uses allowed in this district include outdoor equipment or small buildings
used in concert with gas extraction systems (i.e. gas to energy system),
other response action systems, monitoring wells, or any other equipment
designed to protect, monitor or otherwise ensure the integrity of the landfill
monitoring or improvement systems. Fences and gates shall be allowed
under these provisions.
2. Accessory Uses
Accessory uses shall be limited to installation, operation and maintenance
of equipment to support permitted uses.
3. Conditional Uses
Conditional uses shall be limited to passive uses to protect the integrity of
the landfill area and to protect any person from hazards associated with
the landfill. The landfill shall be planted in cover crops and shall be
maintained by the MPCA.
Any proposed conditional use must be approved by the Commissioner of
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the City of Andover.
Such approved use shall not disturb or threaten to disturb, the integrity of
the landfill cover, liners, any other components of any containment
system, or the function of any monitoring system that exists upon the
described property.
4. Prohibited Uses and Structures
All other uses and structures not specifically allowed as conditional uses,
or that cannot be considered as accessory uses, shall be prohibited in the
CLR District.
5. General Regulations
Requirements for parking, signs, area, and other regulations are set forth
in Title 12 of the City Code. (Amended Ord. 333, 9-19-2006)
12-3-4: ZONING DISTRICT MAP:

12-8-3: EXTERIOR STORAGE: In all districts excluding residential
districts, the governing body may order the owner of property to apply for a
Conditional Use Permit to conduct an open storage use, including existing uses,
provided it is found that said use constitutes a threat to the public health, safety,
convenience, morals or general welfare. (Amended Ord. 8, 10-21-1970; Ord.
380, 4/21/09)
12-8-4: AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATION
The regulation of automobile service stations strives to achieve compatibility of
these stations with adjacent and abutting land uses. In addition, such regulation
is intended to protect the public health, safety and general welfare by mitigating
and potentially detrimental aspects of automobile service stations, including
potential traffic hazards, noise, light glare at night, outdoor storage of
merchandise, indiscriminate advertising, environmental health hazards, and the
like. Automobile service stations shall be subject to the following:
A. All new buildings, the site, tanks, piping and dispensing stations, shall
comply with the current provisions of the Minnesota State Building Code,
Minnesota State Fire Code, and all provisions related to underground
liquid storage systems required in Section 12-8-2 of this code. (Amended
Ord. 438, 6-3-14; Amended Ord. 463, 6-21-16)
B. Building permits shall not be issued for new construction or remodeling of
facilities unless Fire Department approval has been received.
C. Hours of operation will be approved by the City Council.
D. The site plan shall show parking areas for customers, employees, service
vehicles and those needing repair and no other areas of the site will be
allowed vehicle parking. No vehicle shall be parked awaiting service
longer than ten (10) days. Inoperable vehicles are regulated per section
6-5 of City Code.
E. Pump islands are subject to setback requirements.
F. Exterior storage and sales shall only be allowed as approved through the
Conditional Use Permit. (Amended Ord. 314, 10-4-2005)
12-8-5: ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (ADU)
A. Purpose. The purpose of this subdivision is to permit and regulate an
accessory dwelling unit (ADU). An ADU may be located accessory to a
single-family dwelling in the R-1, Single Family Rural zoning district only
as a conditional use subject to the regulations set forth herein. The
minimum lot size in the R-1 zoning district ensures that additional
housing will have less impact on neighboring properties. Because this
use will be located in established one-family residential districts (single
family home neighborhoods), the installation and use of an accessory
dwelling unit must be strictly controlled to avoid adverse physical, social,
economic, environmental and aesthetic impacts. By allowing only those
accessory dwelling units that are in compliance with all of the
performance standards of this subdivision, the character and quality of
existing neighborhoods will be protected.
B. Performance standards. No property within a single-family residential
district shall have more than one dwelling unit, except an ADU may be
permitted as a conditional use to a single family dwelling when all of the
following requirements are met:
1. The primary residence must be located on a lot within an R-1, Single
Family Rural zoning district.
2. The property owner must reside in either the primary residence or the
ADU as their permanent residence according to state law.
3. An ADU may not be subdivided or otherwise segregated in ownership
from the primary residence structure.
4. An ADU's total floor area shall be no more than 900 square feet and not
less than 400 square feet.
5. The ADU shall be separated a minimum of twenty feet (20’) from the
primary residence.
6. The ADU shall meet the setback requirements for an accessory
structure as specified in the City Code.
7. An ADU shall be designed and maintained as to be consistent with the
architectural design, style, appearance and character of the primary
residence as a single-family residence. An ADU shall not extend
beyond the height of the primary residence.
8. Two off-street parking spaces shall be required for the ADU, in addition
to the off-street parking spaces required for the primary residence. An
additional garage may be constructed, provided it complies with all
state and city regulations.
9. No more than one ADU shall be permitted on a lot or parcel.
10. An ADU shall have a permanent foundation. Houses on wheels or
trailers shall be prohibited.
11. An ADU shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all
state laws, state building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and fire
code regulations and City Code requirements.
12. The primary residence and ADU shall be constructed and maintained
in compliance with the property maintenance regulations set forth in the
City Code.
13. Rental of the accessory dwelling unit, or rental of the principal dwelling
unit if the property owner resides in the accessory dwelling unit, shall
require a City rental license pursuant to the City Code.
It is unlawful for a property owner to construct or allow occupancy within an
ADU that does not comply with all of the foregoing requirements. (Amended
Ord. 463, 6-216)

5. Emergency Variance Requests: The City Council may waive Planning
and Zoning Commission review and take immediate action on emergency
variance requests that affect the immediate health, safety and welfare of

the applicant. The applicant is required to show the immediacy of the
issue and the potential health, safety or welfare threat. The City Council
shall determine if the request warrants immediate review. (Amended Ord.
407, 6-21-11)

public facilities;
(2) Will not be injurious to the surrounding neighborhood or
otherwise harm the public health, safety, and general welfare;
(3) Will not have a negative effect on values of property and scenic
views;
(4) Will not impose additional unreasonable costs on the public;

conditions that the City Council has deemed appropriate for
permission of the use, including a condition that the owner may
be required to provide an appropriate financial surety to cover
the cost of removing the interim use and any interim structures
upon the expiration of the interim use permit;
(E) Termination. An interim use permit shall terminate upon the occurrence of
any of the following events, whichever occurs first:
(1) Five (5) years from the date of approval; or

its expiration or if an expired interim use is to be reinstated, an applicant shall

the best interests of the public health, safety, and welfare to provide for
the wise subdivision, use, and development of shorelands of public
waters. The State Legislature has delegated responsibility to local
governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use, and
development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and
enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural
environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of
waters and related land resources. This responsibility is hereby
recognized by the City. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)

twenty five (25) acres in size in unincorporated areas need be regulated
in a local government's shoreland regulation. A body of water created by
a private user where there was no previous shoreland may, at the
discretion of the governing body, be exempt from this chapter.
B. Compliance: The use of any shoreland or public waters; the size and
shape of lots; the use, size, type, and location of structures on lots; the
installation and maintenance of water supply and waste treatment
systems; the grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of
shoreland vegetation; and the subdivision of land shall be in full

PLANNED UNIT A development with alternative development
DEVELOPMENT (PUD): standards approved by the City Council to create a
higher quality development than might otherwise be
achieved through the strict application of this code.
The PUD is an overlay to the original zoning district;
and the use of a PUD allows the development to
waive or modify the standards of the original zoning
district.
PRACTICAL
DIFFICULTIES: As used in connection with the granting of a variance,
means that the property owner proposes to use the
property in a reasonable manner not permit by the
zoning ordinance; the plight of the landowner is due to
circumstances unique to the property not created by
the landowner; and the variance, if granted, will not
alter the essential character of the locality. Economic
considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties. Practical difficulties include, but are not
limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for
solar energy systems. (Amended Ord. 407, 6-21-11)
PUBLIC WATERS: Any waters as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section

main, and all other construction, devices,
appliances, or appurtenances used for conducting
sewage or industrial waste or other wastes to a point
of ultimate disposal.
SHORE IMPACT ZONE: Land located between the ordinary high water level of
a public water, and a line parallel to it at a setback of
fifty percent (50%) of the structure setback.
SHORELAND: Land located within the following distances from
public waters: one thousand feet (1,000') from the
ordinary high water level of a lake, pond, or flowage;
and three hundred feet (300') from a river or stream,
or the landward extent of a floodplain designated by
ordinance on a river or stream, whichever is greater.
The limits of shorelands may be reduced whenever
the waters involved are bounded by topographic
divides that extend landward from the waters for
lesser distances and when approved by the
Commissioner.
SIGNIFICANT HISTORIC Any archaeological site, standing structure, or other
SITE: property that meets the criteria for eligibility to the
National Register of Historic Places, or is listed in the
State Register of Historic Sites, or is determined to be

of Minnesota Statutes Section 307.08. A historic site
meets these criteria if it is presently listed on either
register or if it is determined to meet the qualifications
for listing after review by the Minnesota State
Archaeologist or the Director of the Minnesota
Historical Society. All unplatted cemeteries are
automatically considered to be significant historic
sites.
STEEP SLOPE: Land where agricultural activity or development is
either not recommended or described as poorly suited
due to slope steepness and the site's soil
characteristics, as mapped and described in available
county soil surveys or other technical reports, unless
appropriate design and construction techniques and
farming practices are used in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Where specific information
is not available, "steep slopes" are lands having
average slopes over twelve percent (12%), as
measured over horizontal distances of fifty feet (50')
or more, that are not bluffs.
STRUCTURE: Any building or appurtenance, including decks,
except aerial or underground utility lines, such as
sewer, electric, telephone, telegraph, gas lines,
towers, poles, and other supporting facilities.
SUBDIVISION: Land that is divided for the purpose of sale, rent, or
lease, including Planned Unit Developments.
SURFACE WATER The use of land for commercial purposes, where

VARIANCE: The same as that term is defined or described in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 462.
WATER ORIENTED A small, aboveground building or other improvement,
ACCESSORY except stairways, fences, docks, and retaining walls,
STRUCTURE which, because of the relationship of its use to a
OR FACILITY: surface water feature, reasonably needs to be located
closer to public waters than the normal structure
setback. Examples of such structures and facilities
include boathouses, gazebos, screen houses, fish
houses, pump houses, and detached decks.
WETLAND: A surface water feature classified as a wetland in
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
Circular No. 39 (1971 edition). (Ord. 108, 9-20-

(7) Recreational use of the surface water;
(8) Road and service center accessibility;
(9) Socioeconomic development needs and plans as they involve
water and related land resources;
(10) The land requirements of industry which, by its nature, requires
location in shoreland areas; and
(11) The necessity to preserve and restore certain areas having
significant historical or ecological value.
b. Factors And Criteria For Planned Unit Developments:
(1) Existing recreational use of the surface waters and likely
increases in use associated with planned unit developments;
(2) Physical and aesthetic impacts of increased density;
(3) Suitability of lands for the Planned Unit Development in the

*As accessory to a residential Planned Unit Development.
**Limited expansion of a commercial Planned Unit Development involving
up to six (6) additional dwelling units or sites may be allowed as a
permitted use provided the provisions of Section 13-4-9 of this chapter are
satisfied.
b. Land Use Districts For Rivers And Streams: The land use
districts for rivers and streams (remote, forested, transition,
agricultural, urban and tributary) shall comply with the land use
district provisions as specified in Sections 12-13-1, 12-13-2 and 12-
13-3 of this code.
3. Use And Upgrading Of Inconsistent Land Use Districts:
a. The land use districts adopted in Title 12, Chapter 3 of this code,
as they apply to shoreland areas, and their delineated boundaries
on the official zoning map, may be found to be inconsistent with the
land use district designation criteria specified in Subsection B2 of
this section. These inconsistent land use district designations may
continue until revisions are proposed to change either the land use
district designation within an existing land use district boundary
shown on the official zoning map or to modify the boundary of an
existing land use district shown on the official zoning map.
b. When revision is proposed to any inconsistent land use district
provision, the following additional criteria and procedures shall
apply:
(1) Lakes: When a revision to a land use district designation
on a lake is considered, the land use district boundaries and
use provisions therein for all the shoreland areas within the
jurisdiction of this chapter on said lake must be revised to
make them substantially compatible with the framework in
Subsections B1 and B2 of this section.
(2) Rivers And Streams: When a revision to a land use
district designation on a river or stream is proposed, the land
use district boundaries and the use provisions therein for all
shoreland on both sides of the river or stream within the
same classification within the jurisdiction of this chapter must
be revised to make them substantially compatible with the
framework in Subsections B1 and B2 of this section. If the
same river classification is contiguous for more than a five
(5) mile segment only, the shoreland for a distance of two
and one-half (2.5) miles upstream and downstream, or to the
class boundary if closer, need be evaluated and revised.
c. When an interpretation question arises about whether a specific
land use fits within a given "use" category, the interpretation shall
be made by the Board of Adjustment. When a question arises as to
whether a land use district's boundaries are properly delineated on
the official zoning map, this decision shall be made by the City
Council.
d. When a revision is proposed to an inconsistent land use district
provision by an individual party or landowner, this individual party or
landowner will only be responsible to provide the supporting and/or
substantiating information for the specific parcel in question. The
Planning and Zoning Commission will direct the Zoning
Administrator to provide such additional information for this water
body as is necessary to satisfy Subsections B3a and B3b of this
section.
e. The City Council must make detailed findings of fact and
conclusion when taking final action that this revision and the
upgrading of any inconsistent land use district designation on said
water body are consistent with the enumerated criteria and use
provisions of this Subsection B. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)

4. Additional Special Provisions:
a. Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities
exceeding those in the tables in Subsections A2 and A3 of this
section can only be allowed if designed and approved as
residential Planned Unit Developments under Section 13-4-9 of
this chapter. Only land above the ordinary high water level of
public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot
width standards must be met at both the ordinary high water
level and at the building line. The sewer lot area dimensions in
Subsection A2 of this section can only be used if publicly owned
sewer system service is available to the property.
b. Subdivisions of duplexes, triplexes, and quads on natural
environment lakes must also meet the following standards: (Ord.
108, 9-20-1994)
(1) Each building must be set back at least one hundred fifty
feet (150') from the ordinary high water level; (Ord. 108, 9-
20-1994; amd. 2003 Code)
(2) Each building must have common sewage treatment and
water systems in one location and serve all dwelling units in
the building;
(3) Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be
centralized in one location and serve all dwelling units in the
building; and
(4) No more than twenty five percent (25%) of a lake's
shoreline can be in duplex, triplex, or quad developments.
c. One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding
the duplex lot area and width dimensions presented in Subsections
A1, A2 and A3 of this section, provided the following standards are
met:
(1) For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex
lots, the guest cottage must be located within the smallest
duplex sized lot that could be created including the principal
dwelling unit;
(2) A guest cottage must not cover more than seven hundred
(700) square feet of land surface and must not exceed
fifteen feet (15') in height; and
(3) A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce
its visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent
shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks,
or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions.
(4) Meets the requirements of Section 12-14-16 of this code.
d. Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or as
recreation areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots within
subdivisions are permissible and must meet or exceed the following
standards:
(1) They must meet the width and size requirements for
residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of
controlled access lots.
(2) If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than
six (6) watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot,
then the width of the lot (keeping the same lot depth) must
be increased by the percent of the requirements for riparian
residential lots for each watercraft beyond six (6), consistent
with the following table:
CONTROLLED ACCESS LOT FRONTAGE REQUIREMENTS
Ratio of Lake Size To Shore
Length (Acres/Miles)
Required Increase In
Frontage (Percent)
Less than 100 25
100 – 200 20
201 – 300 15
301 – 400 10
Greater than 400 5
(3) They must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in
the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on
the access lot; and
(4) Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments
must be developed that specify which lot owners have
authority to use the access lot and what activities are
allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching,
loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must
also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not
significantly conflict with general public use of the public
water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent
property owners. Examples of the non-significant conflict
activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The
covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to
be parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be
continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and
must require centralization of all common facilities and
activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize
topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also
require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other
facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as
much as practical from view from the public water, assuming
summer leaf-on conditions.
B. Placement, Design And Height Of Structures:
1. Placement Of Structures On Lots: When more than one setback applies
to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks.
Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed
building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to
conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level,
provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone
or in a bluff impact zone. Structures shall be located as follows:
a. Structure And On Site Sewage System Setbacks (In Feet) From

*One water oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with
Subsection B2 of this section may be set back a minimum distance of ten feet
(10') from the ordinary high water level.
b. Additional Structure Setbacks: The following additional structure
setbacks apply, regardless or the classification of the water body:
Setback From: Setback (In Feet)
Top of bluff 30
Unplatted cemetery 50
Right-of-way line of
federal, state, or county
highway

Right-of-way line of city
road, public street, or
other roads or streets not
classified
40
c. Bluff Impact Zones: Structures and accessory facilities, except
stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact
zones.
d. Uses Without Water Oriented Needs: Commercial, industrial,
public and semipublic uses without water oriented needs must be
located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage or, if
located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either
be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or
be substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or
topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
2. Design Criteria For Structures:
a. High Water Elevations: Structures must be placed in accordance
with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these
controls do not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor,
including basement, is placed or flood-proofed must be determined
as follows:
(1) For lakes: by placing the lowest floor at a level at least
three feet (3') above the highest known water level, or three
feet (3') above the ordinary high water level, whichever is
higher; (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
(2) For rivers and streams: by placing the lowest floor at
least three feet (3') above the flood of record, if data is
available; if data is not available, by placing the lowest floor
at least three feet (3') above the ordinary high water level, or
by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of
proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and
to establish a flood protection elevation. Under all three (3)
approaches, technical evaluations must be done by a
qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 105, Minnesota Regulations Parts
6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management of
floodplain areas. If more than one approach is used, the
highest flood protection elevation determined must be used
for placing structures and other facilities; and (Ord. 108, 9-
20-1994; amd. 2003 Code)
(3) Water oriented accessory structures may have the lowest
floor placed lower than the elevation determined in this
subsection if the structure is constructed of flood resistant
materials to the elevation, electrical and mechanical
equipment are placed above the elevation and, if long
duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to
withstand ice action and wind driven waves and debris.
b. Water Oriented Accessory Structures: Each lot may have one
water oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure
setback in Subsection B1 of this section if the water oriented
accessory structure complies with the following provisions:
(1) The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet (10') in
height, exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area
greater than two hundred fifty (250) square feet. Detached
decks must not exceed eight feet (8') above grade at any
point;
(2) The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary
high water level must be at least ten feet (10');
(3) The structure or facility must be treated to reduce
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent
shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or
color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;
(4) The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails but
must not be enclosed or used as a storage area;
(5) The structure or facility must not be designed or used for
human habitation and must not contain water supply or
sewage treatment facilities; and
(6) As an alternative for general development and
recreational development water bodies, water oriented
accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage, and
including storage of related boating and water oriented
sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to four hundred
(400) square feet, provided the maximum width of the
structure is twenty feet (20') as measured parallel to the
configuration of the shoreline.
c. Stairways, Lifts And Landings: Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alteration for achieving
access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas.
Stairways and lifts must meet the following design requirements:
(1) Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must
not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area. Landings
larger than thirty-two (32) square feet may be used for
commercial properties, public open space recreational
properties, and Planned Unit Developments;
(2) Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or
landings;
(3) Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed
above the ground on posts or pilings or placed into the
ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner
that ensures control of soil erosion;
(4) Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots whenever practical, as
viewed from the surface of the public water assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions; and
(5) Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for
physically handicapped persons are also allowed for
achieving access to shore areas; provided, that the
dimensional and performance standards of Subsections
B2c(1) through B2c(4) of this section are complied with in
addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations
Chapter 1340.
d. Significant Historic Sites: No structure may be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the value of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and
documented in a public repository.
e. Steep Slopes: The Zoning Administrator must evaluate possible
soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters
before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment
systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on
steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be
attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve
existing vegetative screening of structures, vehicles, and other
facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming
summer, leaf-on vegetation.
3. Height Of Structures: All structures in city residential districts, except
religious institutions and nonresidential agricultural structures, must not
exceed twenty-five feet (25') in height. (Amended Ord. 481, 4/3/18)
C. Shoreland Alterations: Alterations of vegetation and topography will be
regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve
shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping,
and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
1. Vegetation Alterations:
a. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures
and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and
parking areas regulated by Subsection D of this section are exempt
from the vegetation alteration standards that follow.
b. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and
forest management uses as regulated in Subsections F2 and F3 of
this section, respectfully, is allowed subject to the following
standards:
(1) Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff
impact zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive
vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to another use
outside of these areas is allowable as a conditional use if an
erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and
approved by the Soil and Water Conservation District in
which the property is located.
(2) In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes,
limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and
trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water
from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the
placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access
paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access
areas, and permitted water oriented accessory structures or
facilities; provided, that:
(A) The screening of structures, vehicles, or other
facilities as viewed from the water, assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced;
(B) Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is
preserved; and
(C) The above provisions are not applicable to the
removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead,
diseased, or pose safety hazards.
2. Topographic Alterations/Grading And Filling:
a. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and
driveways under validly issued construction permits for these
facilities do not require the issuance of a separate grading and
filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this
section must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and
driveways.
b. Public roads and parking areas are regulated by Subsection D of
this section.
c. Notwithstanding Subsections C2a and C2b of this section, a
grading and filling permit will be required for:
(1) The movement of more than ten (10) cubic yards of
material on steep slopes or within shore or bluff impact
zones; and
(2) The movement of more than fifty (50) cubic yards of
material outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff impact
zones.
d. The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and grading
and filling permits, conditional use permits, variances and
subdivision approvals:
(1) Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8
wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively
the proposed activity would affect the following functional
qualities of the wetland*:
(A) Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
(B) Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce
flood damage;
(C) Fish and wildlife habitat;
(D) Recreational use;
(E) Shoreline or land stabilization; and
(F) Noteworthiness, including special qualities such
as historic significance, critical habitat for endangered
plants and animals, or others.
*This evaluation must also include a determination of
whether the wetland alteration determination being
proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other
local, state, or federal agencies such as a watershed
district, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,
or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The
applicant will be so advised.
(2) Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner
that ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is
exposed for the shortest time possible;
(3) Mulches or similar materials must be used, where
necessary, for temporary bare soil coverage, and a
permanent vegetative cover must be established as soon as
possible;
(4) Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments
before they reach any surface water feature must be used;
(5) Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion
control standards consistent with the field office technical
guides of the local Soil and Water Conservation Districts and
the United States Soil Conservation Service;
(6) Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner
that creates an unstable slope;
(7) Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes
must be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued
slope stability and must not create finished slopes of thirty
percent (30%) or greater;
(8) Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff
impact zones; (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
(9) Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of
public waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner
under Minnesota Statutes 103G.245 and 103G.405; (Ord.
108, 9-20-1994; amd. 2003 Code)
(10) Alteration of topography must only be allowed if it is
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and does not
adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties; and
(11) Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated
grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is
permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet (3')
horizontal to one foot (1') vertical, the landward extent of the

and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water
level does not exceed three feet (3').
e. Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a
public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must
be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the Commissioner has
approved the proposed connection to public waters.
D. Placement And Design Of Roads, Driveways And Parking Areas:
1. Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum
screening from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided
by a qualified individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and
constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent
with the field office technical guides of the local Soil and Water
Conservation District, or other applicable technical materials.
2. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and
must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other
reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives
exist, they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed to
minimize adverse impacts.
3. Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and
access related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones,
provided the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this
subsection are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions
of Subsection C2 of this section must be met.
E. Storm Water Management: The following general and specific standards
shall apply:
1. General Standards:
a. When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and
retain storm water runoff before discharge to public waters.
b. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that
will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion
potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas
must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities
or methods used to retain sediment on the site.
c. When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm
water runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of
constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming
devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference
must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and
infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials, and
facilities.
2. Specific Standards:
a. Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the lot area.
b. When constructed facilities are used for storm water
management, documentation must be provided by a qualified
individual that they are designed and installed consistent with the
field office technical guide of the local soil and water conservation
districts.
c. New constructed storm water outfalls to public waters must
provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of
surface debris discharge.
F. Special Provisions:
1. Standards For Commercial, Industrial, Public And Semipublic Uses:
a. Surface water oriented commercial uses and industrial, public, or
semipublic uses with similar need to have access to and use of
public waters may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on
public waters. Those uses with water-oriented needs must meet the
following standards:
(1) In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits,
setbacks, and other zoning standards in this chapter, the
uses must be designed to incorporate topographic and
vegetative screening of parking areas and structures;
(2) Uses that require short term watercraft mooring for
patrons must centralize these facilities and design them to
avoid obstructions to navigation and to be the minimum size
necessary to meet the need; and
(3) Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may
use signs and lighting to convey needed information to the
public, subject to the following general standards:
(A) In addition to meeting the sign requirements of
Section 12-14-9 of this code, no advertising sign or
supporting facilities for signs may be placed in or
upon any public waters. Signs conveying information
or safety messages may be placed in or on public
waters by a public authority or under a permit issued
by the city or its duly designated agency;
(B) Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the
shore impact zone if they are designed and sized to
be the minimum necessary to convey needed
information. They must only convey the location and
name of the establishment and the general types of
goods or services available. The sign must not
contain other detailed information such as product
brands and prices, must not be located higher than
ten feet (10') above the ground, and must not exceed
thirty-two (32) square feet in size. If illuminated by
artificial lights, the lights must be shielded or directed
to prevent illumination out across public waters; and
(C) Other outside lighting may be located within the
shore impact zone or over public waters if it is used
primarily to illuminate potential safety hazards and is
shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct
illumination out across public waters. This does not
preclude use of navigational lights.
b. Uses without water oriented needs must be located on lots or
parcels without public waters frontage or, if located on lots or
parcels with public water frontage, must either be set back double
the normal ordinary high water mark level setback or be
substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or
topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
2. Agricultural Use Standards:
a. General cultivation, farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted
uses if steep slopes or shore impact zones are maintained in
permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation
plan (resource management systems) consistent with the field
office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation
districts or the United States Soil Conservation Service, as provided
by a qualified individual or agency. The shore impact zone for
parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is equal to a line
parallel to and fifty feet (50') from the ordinary high water level.
b. Animal feedlots must meet the following standards:
(1) New feedlots must not be located in the shoreland of
watercourses or in bluff impact zones and must meet a
minimum setback of three hundred feet (300') from the
ordinary high water level of all public water basins; and
(2) Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are
located within three hundred feet (300') of the ordinary high
water level or within a bluff impact zone are allowed if they
do not further encroach into the existing ordinary high water
level setbacks, or encroach on bluff impact zones.
3. Forest Management Standards: The harvesting of timber and
associated reforestation must be conducted consistent with the provisions
of the "Minnesota Non-point Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry And
Provisions Of Water Quality In Forest Management-Best Management
Practices In Minnesota".
4. Extractive Use Standards:
a. Site Development And Restoration Plan: In addition to complying
with the provisions of Section 12-8-5 of this code, an extractive use
site development and restoration plan must be developed,
approved, and followed over the course of operation of the site. The
plan must address dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours
and duration of operation, and anticipated vegetation and
topographic alterations. It must also identify topographic alterations
and actions to be taken during operation to mitigate adverse
environmental impacts, particularly erosion, and must clearly
explain how the site will be rehabilitated after extractive activities
end.
b. Setbacks Of Processing Machinery: Processing machinery must
be located consistent with setback standards for structures from
ordinary high water levels of public waters and from bluffs.
5. Mining Of Metallic Minerals And Peat: Mining of metallic minerals and
peat, as defined in Minnesota Statutes Sections 93.44 to 93.51, shall be a
conditional use. The provisions of Minnesota Statutes Sections 93.44 to
93.51 must be satisfied.
G. Conditional Uses: Conditional uses allowable within the shoreland areas
shall be subject to the review and approval procedures and criteria and
conditions for review of conditional uses established in Section 12-15-6 of
this code. The following additional evaluation criteria and conditions apply
within shoreland areas:
1. Evaluation Criteria: A thorough evaluation of the water body and the
topographic, vegetation, and soil conditions on the site must be made to
ensure:
a. The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public
waters, both during and after construction;
b. The visibility of structure and other facilities as viewed from
public water is limited;
c. The site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage

d. The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters
to safely accommodate these watercraft.
2. Conditions Attached To Conditional Use Permits: The City Council,
upon consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, shall attach such conditions to the issuance of the Conditional
Use Permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter.
Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
a. Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
b. Limitations of the natural vegetation to be removed or the
requirement that additional vegetation be planted; and
c. Special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures,
sewage treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking

H. Water Supply And Sewage Treatment:
1. Water Supply: Any public or private supply of water for domestic
purposes must meet or exceed standards for water quality of the
Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency.
2. Sewage Treatment1: Any premises used for human occupancy must be
provided with an adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows:
a. Publicly owned sewer systems must be used where available.
(Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)

public use and inspection. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994; amd. 2003 Code)
c. On site sewage treatment systems must be set back from the
ordinary high water level in accordance with the setbacks contained
in Subsection B1 of this section.
d. All proposed sites for individual sewage treatment systems shall
be evaluated in accordance with the criteria in the following
Subsections H2d(1) through H2d(4). If the determination of the
site's suitability cannot be made with publicly available existing
information, it shall then be the responsibility of the applicant to
provide sufficient soil boring and percolation tests from on-site field
investigations. Evaluation criteria is as follows:
(1) Depth to the highest known or calculated ground water
table or bedrock.
(2) Soil conditions, properties, and permeability.
(3) Slope.
(4) The existence of lowlands, local surface depressions,
and rock outcrops.

and upgraded in accordance with Subsection 13-4-7C of this
chapter. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
13-4-7: NONCONFORMITIES: All legally established nonconformities as
of the effective date of this chapter may continue, but they will be managed
according to applicable state statutes and other regulations of the city for the
subjects of: alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use,
and intensification of use; except, that the following standards will also apply in
shoreland areas:
A. Construction On Nonconforming Lots Of Record:
1. Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on the date of the
enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of
Subsection 13-4-6A of this chapter may be allowed as building sites
without variances from lot size requirements, provided the use is permitted
in the zoning district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting
lands at all times since it became substandard, was created compliant
with official controls in effect at the time, and sewage treatment and
setback requirements of this chapter are met.
2. A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any
use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In
evaluating the variance, the board of adjustments shall consider sewage
treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot, and shall
deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
3. If, in a group of two (2) or more contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of
Subsection 13-4-6A of this chapter, the lot must not be considered as a
separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot
must be combined with one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or
more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of said Subsection
13-4-6A as much as possible. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
B. Additions/Expansions To Nonconforming Structures:
1. All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing
nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other
requirements of Section 13-4-6 of this chapter. Any deviation from these
requirements must be authorized by a variance. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994;
amd. 2003 Code)
2. Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not
meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of the
following criteria and standards are met:
a. The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established;
b. A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing
ordinary high water level setback of the structure;
c. The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level
does not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the existing setback of the
structure from the ordinary high water level or does not encroach
closer than thirty feet (30'), whichever is more restrictive; and
d. The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or
screened.
C. Nonconforming Sewage Treatment Systems:
1. A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of
Subsection 13-4-6H of this chapter must be upgraded, at a minimum, at
any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement
on, or use of the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage
treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only
deficiency is the sewage treatments system's improper setback from the
ordinary high water level. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
2. The City Council has, by formal resolution, notified the Commissioner of
its program to identify nonconforming sewage treatment systems. The City
will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system
identified by this program within a reasonable period of time that will not
exceed two (2) years. Sewage systems installed according to all
applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under
Minnesota Statutes Section 103F.211, in effect at the time of installation,
may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be
failing; except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits,
or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area
separation above ground water than required by the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency Chapter 7080 for design of on site sewage treatment
systems, shall be considered nonconforming. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994; amd.
2003 Code)
13-4-8: SUBDIVISION AND PLATTING PROVISIONS1:
A. Land Suitability: Each lot created through subdivision, including Planned
Unit Developments authorized under Section 13-4-9 of this chapter, must
be suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration.
Suitability analysis by the City Council shall consider susceptibility to
flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe
limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep topography,
inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near shore
aquatic conditions unsuitable for water based recreation, important fish
and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other
feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or
welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the
community.
B. Consistency With Other Controls: Subdivisions must conform to all official
controls of the community. A subdivision will not be approved where a
later variance from one or more standards in official controls would be
needed to use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by
publicly owned sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be
1 See also section 12-12-6 of this code.
approved unless domestic water supply is available and a sewage
treatment system consistent with Subsections 13-4-6B and H of this
chapter can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot
size and dimensional requirements of Subsection 13-4-6A of this chapter,
including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is free of limiting
factors sufficient for the construction of two (2) standard soil treatment
systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be
approved.

5. Location of 100-year floodplain areas and floodway districts from
existing adopted maps or data; and
6. A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level, the "toe"
and the "top" of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from
the top of the bluff and the lake or stream.
D. Dedications: When a land or easement dedication is a condition of
subdivision approval, the approval must provide easement over natural
drainage or ponding areas for management of storm water and significant
wetlands.
E. Platting:
1. All subdivisions that create five (5) or more lots or parcels that are two
and one-half (2 1/2) acres or less in size shall be processed as a plat in
accordance with Minnesota Statutes Chapter 505. No permit for
construction of buildings or sewage treatment systems shall be issued for
lots created after these official controls were enacted, unless the lot was
approved as part of a formal subdivision. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
2. Shoreland Plats: All plats in shoreland areas shall be submitted to and
reviewed by the State Division of Waters, Soils and Minerals before final
action by the City. (Amended Ord. 8, 10-21-1970)
F. Controlled Access Or Recreational Lots: Lots intended as controlled
access to public waters or for recreation use areas for use by nonriparian
lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the sizing criteria in
Subsection 13-4-6A4 of this chapter. (Ord. 108, 9-20-1994)
13-4-9: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDS)1:
A. Types Of PUDs Permissible: Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are
allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of
previously built sites, or conversions of existing buildings and land. The
land use districts in which they are an allowable use are identified in the
land use district descriptions in Subsection 13-4-5B of this chapter and
per Title 12, Chapter 12 of this code.
B. Processing PUDs: Planned Unit Developments must be processed as a
conditional use. The expansion to an existing commercial PUD involving
six (6) or less new dwelling units or sites since the date this chapter was
adopted is permissible, provided an Amended Conditional Use Permit is
granted and the total project density does not exceed the allowable
densities calculated in the project density evaluation procedures in
Subsection E of this section. The provisions of Title 12, Chapter 12 and
Section 12-15-6 of this code shall apply. Approval cannot occur until the
Environmental Review Process (EAW/EIS) is complete.
C. Application For PUD: The applicant for a PUD must submit the
following documents (in addition to the requirements as specified in
Title 11 and Title 12, chapter 12 of this code) prior to final action being
taken on the application request:

boundaries, surface water features, existing and proposed structures and
1 See also chapter 3 of this title.
other facilities, land alteration, sewage treatment and water supply
systems (where public systems will not be provided), and topographic
contours at ten foot (10') intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined
commercial and residential development, the site plan/plat must indicate
and distinguish which buildings and portions of the project are residential,
commercial, or a combination of the two (2).
2. A property owner association agreement (for residential PUDs) with
mandatory membership, all in accordance with the requirements of
Subsection F of this section.
3. Deed restriction, covenants, permanent easement, or other instruments
that:
a. Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations,
construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft, and
construction of commercial buildings in residential PUDs; and
b. Ensure the long-term preservation and maintenance of open
space in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in
Subsection F of this section.
4. When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and the
floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied.
5. Those additional documents as requested by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council that are necessary to explain how the PUD
will be designed and will function.
D. Site Suitable Area Evaluation: Proposed new or expansions to
existing Planned Unit Developments must be evaluated using the
following procedures and standards to determine the suitable area
for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in Subsection
E of this section.
1. The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more
lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water
level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
SHORELAND TIER DIMENSIONS
Unsewered
(Feet)
Sewered
(Feet)
General development lakes
First tier 200 200
Second and additional tiers 267 200
Recreational development lakes 267 267
Natural environment lakes 400 320
All river classes 300 300
2. The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from
the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water
level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are
then subjected to either the residential or commercial Planned Unit
Development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of
dwelling units or sites.
E. Residential And Commercial PUD Density Evaluation: The procedures
for determining the base density of a PUD and density increase multipliers
are as follows: allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier further from the water body, but must not be transferred to any
other tier closer.
1. Commercial PUD Base Density Evaluation: The suitable area within
each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or,
for rivers, the single residential lot width standard times the tier depth,
unless the City Council has specified an alternative minimum lot size for
rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling units or
sites for each tier. Proposed location and numbers of dwelling units or
sites for the residential Planned Unit Developments are then compared
with the tier, density, and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria
in Subsection F of this section.
2. Commercial PUD Base Density Evaluation:
a. Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units
or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed
units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes need not
include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or porches and
basements, unless they are habitable space.
b. Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table:

*For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios
listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios
listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the
ratios listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational
camping areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured
home or, if unknown, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet.
c. Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to
yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling
units or sites.
d. Divide the total floor area by tier computed in Subsection E2c of
this section by the average inside living area size determined in
Subsection E2a of this section. This yields a base number of
dwelling units and sites for each tier.
e. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the
commercial Planned Unit Development are then compared with the
tier, density and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in
Subsection F of this section.
3. Density Increase Multipliers:
a. Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities
previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in
Section 13-4-6 of this chapter are met or exceeded and the design
criteria in Subsection F of this section are satisfied. The allowable
density increases in Subsection E3b of this section will only be
allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are
increased to at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the minimum
setback, or the impact on the water body is reduced an equivalent
amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional
means acceptable to the City Council, and the setback is at least
twenty five percent (25%) greater than the minimum setback.
b. Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases of
residential or commercial Planned Unit Developments:
Density Evaluation Tiers
Maximum Density Increase
Within Each Tier (Percent)
First 50
Second 100
Third 200
Fourth 200
Fifth 200
F. Maintenance And Design Criteria:
1. Maintenance And Administration Requirements:
a. Before final approval of a Planned Unit Development, adequate
provisions must be developed for preservation and maintenance in
perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued existence and
functioning of the development.
b. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public
dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and
permanent preservation and maintenance of open space are
required. The instruments must include all of the following
protections:
(1) Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs);
(2) Vegetation and topographic alteration other than routine
maintenance prohibited;
(3) Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles
and other materials prohibited; and
(4) Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
c. Unless an equally effective alternative community framework is
established, when applicable, all residential Planned Unit
Developments must use an owners' association with the following
features:
(1) Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or
site purchaser and any successive purchasers;
(2) Each member must pay a pro rata share of the
association's expenses, and unpaid assessments can
become liens on units or sites;
(3) Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate
changing conditions; and
(4) The association must be responsible for insurance,
taxes, and maintenance of all commonly owned property and
facilities.
2. Open Space Requirements: Planned Unit Developments must contain
open space meeting all of the following criteria:
a. At least fifty percent (50%) of the total project area must be
preserved as open space;
b. Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by
road surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water oriented
accessory structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not
be included in the computation of minimum open space;
c. Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas
containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
d. Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by
owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial
dwelling units or sites, and by the general public;
e. Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems
if the use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the
systems;
f. Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but
may contain water oriented accessory structures or facilities;
g. The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of
restrictive deed covenants, permanent easements, public
dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and
permanent means; and
h. The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks,
must be included as open space. For residential PUDs, at least fifty
percent (50%) of the shore impact zone area of existing
developments or at least seventy percent (70%) of the shore impact
zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural or
existing state. For commercial PUDs, at least fifty percent (50%) of
the shore impact zone must be preserved in its natural state.
3. Erosion Control And Storm Water Management: Erosion control
and storm water management plans must be developed, and the
PUD must:
a. Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the
likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after
construction. This must be accomplished by limiting the amount
and length of time of bare ground exposure. Temporary ground
covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or
other appropriate techniques must be used to minimize erosion
impact on surface water features. Erosion control plans approved
by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project
size and site physical characteristics warrant; and
b. Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonable
expected quantities and qualities of storm water runoff. Impervious
surface coverage within any tier must not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the tier area; except that for commercial PUDs,
thirty five percent (35%) impervious surface coverage may be
allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an
approved storm water management plan and consistency with
Subsection 13-4-6C of this chapter.
4. Centralization And Design Of Facilities: Centralization and
design of facilities and structures must be done according to the
following standards:
a. Planned Unit Developments must be connected to publicly
owned water supply and sewer systems, if available. On site water
supply and sewage treatment systems must be centralized and
designed and installed to meet or exceed applicable standards or
rules of the Minnesota Department of Health and Subsections 13-4-
6B and H of this chapter. On-site sewage treatment systems must
be located on the most suitable areas of the development, and
sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors must be provided for a
replacement soil treatment system for each sewage system;
b. Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups
and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be
designed and located to meet or exceed the following dimensional
standard for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from the
ordinary high water level, elevation above the surface water
features, and maximum height. Setbacks from the ordinary high
water level must be increased in accordance with Subsection E3 of
this section for developments with density increases;
c. Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to, swimming
areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps,
must be centralized and located in areas suitable for them.
Evaluation of suitability must include consideration of land slope,
water depth, vegetation, soils, depth-to ground water and bedrock,
or other relevant factors. The number of spaces provided for
continuous beaching, mooring, or docking of watercraft must not
exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier
(notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing commercially
used harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for
loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by
occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other tiers;
d. Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be treated to
reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent
shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or
other means acceptable to the City Council, assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening must be
preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided;
e. Accessory structures and facilities, except water oriented
accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure
setback and must be centralized; and
f. Water oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed
if they meet or exceed design standards contained in Subsection
13-4-6B of this chapter and are centralized.
G. Conversions: The City Council may allow existing resorts or other land
uses and facilities to be converted to residential Planned Unit
Developments if all of the following standards are met:
1. Proposed Conversions: Proposed conversion must be initially evaluated
using the same procedures for residential Planned Unit Developments
involving all new construction. Inconsistencies between existing features
of the development and these standards must be identified.
2. Deficiencies: Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment,
structure color, impervious coverage, open space, and shore recreation
facilities must be corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the
Conditional Use Permit.
3. Shore And Bluff: Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be
evaluated and reasonable improvements made as part of the conversion.
These improvements must include, where applicable, the following:
a. Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or other facilities that no
longer need to be located in shore or bluff impact zones;
b. Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve
vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as
viewed from the water; and
c. If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff impact
zones, conditions are attached to approvals of conversions that
preclude exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial
alterations. The conditions must also provide for future relocation of
dwelling units, where feasible, to other locations, meeting all
setback and elevation requirements when they are rebuilt or
replaced.
4. Existing Dwellings Or Sites: Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site
densities that exceed standards in Subsection E of this section may be
allowed to continue but must not be allowed to be increased, either at the
time of conversion or in the future. Efforts must be made during the
conversion to limit impacts of high densities by requiring seasonal use,
improving vegetative screening, centralizing shore recreation facilities,
installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means. (Ord. 108, 9-
20-1994)

(12%). This applies to those slopes within the land
use district that are beyond the setback provisions
from the ordinary high water mark.
BUILDING LINE: That line measured across the width of the lot at
the point where the main structure is placed in
accordance with setback provisions.
CAMPGROUND: An area accessible by vehicle and containing
campsites or camping spots for tents and trailer
camping.

that shall be occupied by no more than one principal
structure equipped with sanitary facilities, together
with such open spaces are as required under the
provisions of the zoning ordinance, having not less
than the minimum area required by the zoning
ordinance for a building site in the district in which
such lot is situated and having its principal frontage
on a public street.

RECREATION USES: the outdoor character of an area, including hiking
and riding trails, primitive campsites, campgrounds,
waysides, parks and recreational areas.
ORDINARY HIGH A mark delineating the highest water level which has
WATER MARK: been maintained for a sufficient period of time to
leave evidence upon the landscape. The ordinary
high water mark is commonly that point where the

open water: the main channel, adjoining side
channels, backwaters and sloughs.
PLANNED UNIT A development having two (2) or more principal
DEVELOPMENT: uses or structures on a single parcel of land and
developed according to an approved plan.
PRACTICAL
DIFFICULTIES: As used in connection with the granting of a variance,
means that the property owner proposes to use the
property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the
zoning ordinance; the plight of the landowner is due to
circumstances unique to the property not created by

boundaries.
SUBDIVISION: Improved or unimproved land or lands which are
divided for the purpose of ready sale or lease, or
divided successively within a five (5) year period for
the purpose of sale or lease, into three (3) or more
lots or parcels of less than five (5) acres each,
contiguous in area and which are under common
ownership or control.
SUBSTANDARD USE: Any use within the land use district existing prior to
February 3, 1981, which is permitted within the
applicable land use district but does not meet the
minimum lot area, length of water frontage,
structure setbacks or other dimensional standards
of this chapter.
VARIANCE: Any modification or variation of official controls where
it is determined that by reason of exceptional
circumstances, the strict enforcement of the official
controls would cause practical difficulties. (Amended
Ord. 407, 6-21-11)

pursuant to Minnesota Statutes. However, lines of 200 kilovolts or more
that are exempt by the Environmental Quality Board shall require a
Conditional Use Permit.
7. Construction Of Public Roads: In addition to such permits as may be
required by Minnesota Statutes, a Conditional Use Permit shall be
required for any construction or reconstruction of public roads within the
Rum River land use district. Such construction or reconstruction shall be
subject to the standards and criteria of Minnesota Statutes, and city street
and road standards as adopted by the City Council. A Conditional Use
Permit is not required for minor public streets which are streets intended to
serve primarily as an access to abutting properties; however, they shall be
constructed or reconstructed to comply with city street and road
standards. Public roads include township, county, and municipal roads
and highways that serve or are designed to serve flows of traffic between
communities or other traffic generating areas.
F. Subdivisions: No land shall be subdivided which is determined by the
governing body or the Commissioner to be unsuitable by reason of
flooding, inadequate for development, severe erosion potential,
unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment
capabilities or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety,
or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or the
community. Percolation rate tests and soil boring tests shall be required as
deemed necessary by the City Building Official, to be done by the
subdivider, and the results submitted to the City Council to assure that
each lot in the proposed subdivision is capable of supporting a sewage
treatment system of the type recommended by the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency standards for individual sewage treatment systems1.
G. Planned Unit Developments: A Planned Unit Development may be
allowed only when the proposed clustering provides a better means of
preserving agricultural land, open space, woods, scenic views, wetlands,
and other features of the natural environment than traditional subdivision
development. Except for minimum setbacks and height limits, altered
dimensional standards may be allowed as exceptions to this chapter for
Planned Unit Developments, provided:
1. Preliminary plans are approved by the Commissioner prior to their
enactment by the governing body.
2. Central sewage facilities are installed which meet the standards,
criteria, rules or regulations of the Minnesota Department of Health and
the Pollution Control Agency.
3. Open space is preserved. This may be accomplished through the use of

13-6-1: INCORPORATION OF STATE REGULATIONS: This chapter
hereby incorporates by reference the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991
(Minnesota Statutes Section 103G.221 et seq., hereinafter referred to as the
WCA) and any future amendments adopted by the legislature. All wetlands and
activities shall comply with those regulations as adopted under the WCA. (Ord.
114A, 7-17-2001)
13-6-2: FINDINGS AND INTENT: The city finds it necessary to regulate the
use of lands surrounding wetlands and storm water ponds. Buffer strips are
necessary and beneficial to maintaining the health of wetlands and storm water
ponds. These strips of land surrounding wetlands and storm water ponds protect
their shorelines from erosion, while serving to filter sediment, chemicals and
other nutrients before storm water discharges into these water features. Buffer
strips are also beneficial in providing habitat for wildlife. It is the intent of this
chapter to establish and maintain a buffer strip that abuts all wetlands and storm
water ponds that may be left undisturbed, or in its natural condition. (Ord. 114A,
7-17-2001; amd. 2003 Code)
13-6-3: PURPOSE AND IMPLEMENTATION:
Through the adoption and enforcement of this chapter, the city shall promote the
general health, safety, and welfare of its residents by both conserving and
protecting water features of the city. The city seeks to accomplish the following
purposes:
A. To satisfy all of the requirements of the Wetlands Conservation Act of
1991, as amended;
B. To balance the need to preserve and protect natural resources and
systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to
support the efficient use of developable land within the city;
C. To promote water quality by maintaining the ability to recharge ground
water and receive the discharge of ground water, to retain sediment and
toxicants and filter and strip nutrients from surface water runoff before it
discharges into community lakes and streams, thus avoiding the
contamination and eutrophication of these water features; and
D. To provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of
diversity of both plant and animal species within the city. (Ord. 114A,
7-17-2001)
13-6-4: DEFINITIONS:
BUFFER STRIP: A one rod (16.5 feet or 5 meters) wide area abutting a
wetland and/or storm water pond that shall be left
undisturbed or in its natural condition during the
development, building and landscaping phases. The
buffer strip shall not be included within the one
hundred and ten foot (110') buildability requirement of
Section 11-1-4 of this code, definition of "buildable
lots". (Amd. 2/20/07, Ord. 340)
WETLANDS: Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic
systems where the water table is usually at or near
the surface or the land is covered by shallow water.
For the purposes of this definition, "wetlands" must:
A. Have a predominance of hydric soils;
B. Be inundated or saturated by surface water or
ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions;
and
C. Under normal circumstances, support a prevalence
of such hydrophytic vegetation. (Ord. 114A, 7-17-
2001)
13-6-5: BUFFER STRIPS AND SETBACKS:
A. Buffer Strips Required: For lots of record created after the adoption of this
chapter, a buffer strip shall be established abutting all wetlands and/or
storm water ponds. The buffer provisions of this chapter shall not apply to
developments that have paid the preliminary plat fee (as established in
Subsection 11-2-2B of this code) to the city within thirty (30) days after the
adoption of this chapter.
B. Requirements: Buffer strips shall be established and maintained in
accordance with the following requirements:
1. Buffer strips shall be identified within each lot by active protective
fencing approved by the city. The developer shall be responsible for the
placement of the fencing. A one rod (16.5 feet or 5 meters, measured
linear) wide undisturbed buffer strip shall be maintained abutting all
wetlands and/or storm water ponds during the development and building
phases. (Ord. 114A, 7-17-2001)
2. Buffer strips shall apply to all wetlands and/or storm water ponds.
Buffer strips shall be measured from the delineated wetland boundary
around wetlands and from the designated normal water level elevation
surrounding storm water, sedimentation and/or rate control ponds, as
identified on the grading, drainage, and erosion control plan for all new
developments. (Amd. 2/20/07, Ord. 340)
C. Fencing:
1. Active protective fencing shall be installed by the developer/builder
along the most upland edge of all buffer strips prior to any development
and/or building construction. These fences will be a minimum of three feet
(3') high. Geotextile fabric fencing (silt fence) is acceptable as long as it
meets MNDOT 3733 Type 3.
2. All fencing barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout
development and/or building construction. The fencing barriers are
intended to inform the developer, builder and property owner of the buffer
strip protection process.
3. All fencing barriers shall not be removed until construction and/or
development has been completed. It shall be the responsibility of the
builder or property owner to remove all fencing barriers once the lot has
been landscaped (soil and/or seed established). (Ord. 114A, 7-17-2001;
amd. 2003 Code)
D. Exemptions From Provisions:
1. City initiated projects (i.e., trails, roads, etc.) may be exempt from the
buffer strip requirements.
2. No height requirements shall apply to grass and weeds that are located
in the buffer strip. (Ord. 114, 7-16-1996; amd. 2003 Code)
13-6-6: BUFFER STRIP PROTECTION PLAN:
A. A wetland buffer strip protection plan shall be submitted either as
part of the grading, drainage and erosion control plan or as a
separate drawing, to include the following:
1. Location of all wetlands.
2. Location of wetland buffer measures.
3. Location of buffer strips.
4. All required setbacks from the buffer strips.
B. The following notes shall be indicated on the wetland buffer strip plan in
large letters:
1. Contact the city prior to any land disturbance.
2. All wetland buffer strip protection measures shall be installed prior to
development and/or building construction. (Ord. 114, 7-16-1996)
13-6-7: VARIANCES:
A. Request For Variance: Requests for variances from the strict
provisions of this chapter shall be made in accordance with the
procedures and requirements set forth in City Code 12-14-7,
except that any variance requests shall be made as a part of the
preliminary plat approval process, or lot split approval process,
when applicable. (Amended Ord. 407, 6-21-11)
13-6-8: INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS: The City Administrator or
his or her duly authorized employees shall inspect all premises and places within
the city as often as practicable to determine whether any condition described in
this chapter exists. The inspector shall investigate all reported wetland incidents.
(Ord. 114, 7-16-1996)
13-6-9: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
A. Notice Of Violation:
1. A general notice will be given to any developer, builder, or property
owner who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. The notice
will state the following information:
a. The violation.
b. Items or work to be completed in order to comply.
c. Date work to be completed.
2. Failure to comply with this notice will result in an order to stop work on
the site.

14-1-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and
Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Andover, Minnesota, does
ordain the provisions of this chapter.
14-1-2 FINDINGS OF FACT
A. This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of Andover,
Minnesota. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and
disruptions.
B. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is adopted to comply
with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44
Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the
community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
14-1-3 PURPOSE
This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts,
improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
October 2015 3
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community
and economic development.
14-1-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. This ordinance adopts the floodplain maps applicable to Andover and includes three
floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain.
1. Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the
standards in Sections 14-1-7 and 14-1-8 will apply, depending on the location of a
property.
2. Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not delineated on the
floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within
the General Floodplain district, the Floodway District standards in Section 14-1-7
apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined
in Section 14-1-9. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe
District standards in Section 14-1-8 may apply outside the floodway.
B. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This ordinance applies to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the City of Andover shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the
attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood
Fringe, or General Floodplain Districts.
The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are overlay districts that
are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay
districts are in addition to any other requirements in this ordinance. In case of a
conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply.
C. Incorporation of Maps by Reference: The following maps together with all
attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the
Official Zoning Map and this ordinance. The attached material includes the Flood
Insurance Study for Anoka County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas and the Flood
Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, all dated December 16, 2015 and all
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file
in the office of the Andover Community Development Department

D. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation
(RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional
flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain
that result from designation of a floodway.
E. Interpretation: The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling
distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
1. Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official
zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the
governing factor. The Zoning Administrator must interpret the boundary
location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of
the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the
regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data.
2. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Planning and Zoning
Commission/Board of Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
F. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements.
However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
ordinance prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This ordinance does not imply that areas
outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part
of the City of Andover or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
H. Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this ordinance
shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.

fences and rigid walls, are regulated as structures under this ordinance.
Flood – a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a
wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
Flood Frequency – the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage
or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
Flood Fringe – that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is
synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in the Flood Insurance Study for
Anoka County, Minnesota.
Flood Prone Area – any land susceptible to being inundated by water from any
source (see “Flood”).
Floodplain – the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse
which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
Floodproofing – a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to
properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or
elimination of flood damages.
Floodway – the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those
portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store
the regional flood discharge.

Lowest Floor – the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a
building’s lowest floor.
Manufactured Home – a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home”
does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
Obstruction – any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile,
refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the
direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by such water.
One Hundred Year Floodplain – lands inundated by the “Regional Flood” (see
definition).
Principal Use or Structure – all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or
structures.
Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream
or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the
segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most
typically constitute a reach.
Recreational Vehicle – a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or
less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not
for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this ordinance, the term
recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.”
Regional Flood – a flood which is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1% chance or 100-
year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood"
used in a flood insurance study.
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) - an elevation not less than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused
by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
Repetitive Loss - Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each
such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
Special Flood Hazard Area – a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous
with “One Hundred Year Floodplain.”
October 2015 7
Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground
or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached
garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the
exemption criteria specified in Section 9.22 of this ordinance and other similar items.
Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after
damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.” For
the purpose of this ordinance, “historic structure” is as defined in 44 Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
A. Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into
Section 14-1-4(c) above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate

All Uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the stage of the 1%
chance or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or
reaches affected.
October 2015 10
a. Fill; Storage of Materials and Equipment:
1. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant
life is prohibited.
2. Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain
must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other
acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel operations and similar uses must
be covered by a long-term site development plan.
3. Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which would cause an
increase to the stage of the 1% percent chance or regional flood may only be
allowed if the City Council has approved a plan that assures removal of the
materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
3. Accessory Structures:
(a) Accessory structures must not be designed for human habitation.
(b) Accessory structures, if permitted, must be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood
waters:
(1) Whenever possible, structures must be constructed with the longitudinal
axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
(2) So far as practicable, structures must be placed approximately on the
same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
(c) Accessory structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. All floodproofed accessory
structures must meet the following additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls; and
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in the structure must be elevated
to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
floodproofed.
(d) As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed
to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building
Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment
and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. A detached garage may only be
used for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All structures must meet
the following standards:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
October 2015 11
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the
bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for
automatic openings.
4. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross
section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of
Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
5. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an
increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must
assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
6. Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the
channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage
system.
14-1-8 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
A. Permitted Uses:
1. Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures allowed in the underlying
zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in Sections 14-1-8A(2). If no
pre-existing, underlying zoning districts exist, then any residential or
nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land is a permitted use provided
it does not constitute a public nuisance.
2. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
A. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that
the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one
foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill must extend at
the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure.
1. All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to
prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
2. As an alternative to elevation on fill, an accessory structure that constitutes
a minimal investment and that does not exceed 576 square feet in size may be
internally floodproofed in accordance with Section 14-1-7B(3).
B. The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not
exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with Section 14-1-8A(2) A of this ordinance, or if
allowed as a conditional use under Section 14-1-8B(3) below.
C. The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
D. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
October 2015 12
E. Fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by
the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
F. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation
not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must
have a flood warning /emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the City
Council.
G. Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an
elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any
facilities used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is
inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the
velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of
the regional (1% chance) flood.
H. Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations must be
minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In
considering permit applications, due consideration must be given to the needs
of industries with operations that require a floodplain location.
I. Flood fringe developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of
the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage
system.
J. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of
Section 14-1-12 of this ordinance.
B. Conditional Uses: The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional
uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district,
following the procedures in Section 10.4 of this ordinance. Conditional uses must
meet the standards in Sections 5.24 through 5.30 and Section 5.4.
1. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with
Section 14-1-8A(2)A of this ordinance.
2. Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
3. The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is
not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 14-1-8A(2)A of
this ordinance.

following:
(a) Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
October 2015 13
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance
with Section 14-1-8C(4) of this ordinance.
3. All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below
the regulatory flood protection elevation must be floodproofed in accordance
with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building
Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2
floodproofing classification in the State Building Code, which requires making
the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures wet floodproofed
to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification are not permitted.
4. The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material
on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory
flood protection elevation) must comply with an approved
erosion/sedimentation control plan.
(a) The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a
flood event at a minimum of the regional (1% chance) flood event.
(b) The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or
other qualified individual acceptable to the City Council.
(c) The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from
the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5. Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection
elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal
of such materials within the time available after a flood warning.
6. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to
elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings,
parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck
under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered abovegrade
and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is
above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally
flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative
elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(a) Design and Certification - The structure’s design and as-built condition must be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance
with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically,
that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating
within these components during times of flooding.
October 2015 14
(b) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade, fully
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to
internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(1) The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is
to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of
two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic
openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net
area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that
they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any
form of human intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in
accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building
Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
14-1-9 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (GF)
A. Permitted Uses:
1. The uses listed in Section 14-1-7A of this ordinance, Floodway District
Permitted Uses, are permitted uses.
2. All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria
specified in Section 14-1-9B below. Section 14-1-7 applies if the proposed use
is determined to be in the Floodway District. Section 14-1-8 applies if the
proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe District.
B. Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General
Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state, or other source.
2. If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the
applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the
regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall
within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must be consistent
with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the
standards in 14-1-9B(3) below.
3. The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following
components, as applicable:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
October 2015 15
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic
analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without
increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage increase than
0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages
would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within
the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
4. The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and assess the
technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe
District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek
technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or
agency, including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this
assessment, the Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
5. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 14-1-7 and 14-1-8 of this
ordinance.

boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation
of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings
and platting documents.
4. In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the information
required in Section 6.2 of this ordinance to determine the regional flood
October 2015 16
elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
5. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood prone
area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
(a) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within
the flood prone area,
(b) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems
are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and
(c) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard.
C. Building Sites: If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of
manufactured homes) must be:

exemption when development occurs on the site that exceeds a minimal
investment for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The
recreational vehicle and all accessory structures will then be treated as new
structures subject to the elevation and floodproofing requirements of Section
14-1-8 of this ordinance. No development or improvement on the parcel or
attachment to the recreational vehicle is allowed that would hinder the removal
of the vehicle should flooding occur.
14-1-13 ADMINISTRATION
A. Zoning Administrator: A Zoning Administrator or other official designated by the
City Council must administer and enforce this ordinance.
B. Permit Requirements:
1. Permit Required. A permit must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator
prior to conducting the following activities:
(a) The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of any
building, structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance and repair also
requires a permit if such work, separately or in conjunction with other
planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement as defined in this
ordinance.
(b) The use or change of use of a building, structure, or land.
(c) The construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system, although a
permit is not required for a farm fence as defined in this ordinance.
(d) The change or extension of a nonconforming use.
(e) The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or
any other source.
(f) The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or
equipment within the floodplain.
(g) Relocation or alteration of a watercourse - including new or replacement
culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been applied
for.
(h) Any other type of “development” as defined in this ordinance.
2. Application for Permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator. The permit
application must include the following as applicable:
October 2015 19
(a) A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed
buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an influence on
the permit.
(b) Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream channel.
(c) Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits or
approvals.
(d) Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator as
necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
3. Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or Nonconforming Use.
No building, land or structure may be occupied or used in any manner until a
certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the Zoning Administrator
stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
ordinance.
4. Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a registered
professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the
finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance. Floodproofing measures must be certified by a
registered professional engineer or registered architect.
5. Record of First Floor Elevation. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a
record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain.
The Zoning Administrator must also maintain a record of the elevation to which
structures and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed.
6. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or
relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must notify adjacent
communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in public waters
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate
notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago
Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
7. Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease Base
Flood Elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after
the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the
changes by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific data.
C. Variances:
1. Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of this
ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable state
statutes and Section 12-14-7 of the City Code.
2. Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance must not
allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of flood
October 2015 20
protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area,
or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
3. Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
(a) Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(b) Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good
and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(c) Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. Flood Insurance Notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant
for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and 2) Such
construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and
property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance
actions.
5. General Considerations. The community may consider the following factors in
granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses
in floodplains:
(a) The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments;
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to
the injury of others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of
these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage
and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(e) The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the
community;
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are
not subject to flooding;
October 2015 21
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan
and flood plain management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
6. Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed variances
to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’ notice of the
hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the
respective DNR area hydrologist.
7. Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting
variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The
notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area
hydrologist.
8. Record-Keeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such
variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the National
Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
D. Conditional Uses:
1. Administrative Review. An application for a conditional use permit under the
provisions of this ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with
Section 12-14-6 of the City Code.
2. Factors Used in Decision-Making. In passing upon conditional use
applications, the City Council must consider all relevant factors specified in
other sections of this ordinance, and those factors identified in Section
14-1-13(C)5 of this ordinance.
3. Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Permits. The City Council may attach
such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it deems necessary
to fulfill the purposes of this ordinance. Such conditions may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
(a) Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities.
(b) Limitations on period of use, occupancy, and operation.
(c) Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
(d) Requirements for construction of channel modifications, compensatory storage,
dikes, levees, and other protective measures.
(e) Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the State Building Code and this
ordinance. The applicant must submit a plan or document certified by a registered
October 2015 22
professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures are consistent
with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the
particular area.
4. Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed
conditional uses to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten
days’ notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S.
Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
5. Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting
conditional uses must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action.
The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR
area hydrologist.
E. NONCONFORMITIES
1. Continuance of Nonconformities: A use, structure, or occupancy of land which was
lawful before the passage or amendment of this ordinance but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may be continued subject to the
following conditions. Historic structures, as defined in Section 14-1-5(b) of this
ordinance, are subject to the provisions below.
a. A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded, changed,
enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage potential or degree
of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in 14-1-13E below. Expansion
or enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the Floodway District
is prohibited.
b. Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential
must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance
with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 thru FP-
4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as
further restricted in 14-1-13E(1)C and 14-1-13E(1)g below.
c. If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50
percent of the market value of any nonconforming structure, then the entire
structure must meet the standards of Section 14-1-7 and 14-1-8 of this
ordinance for new structures depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively. The cost of all structural
alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction materials
and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor.
d. If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is
discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this ordinance. The Assessor must notify the Zoning Administrator
in writing of instances of nonconformities that have been discontinued for a
period of more than one year.
e. If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in Section 14-1-5 of
this ordinance, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
October 2015 23
provisions of this ordinance. The applicable provisions for establishing new
uses or new structures in Sections 14-1-7 and 14-1-8 will apply depending upon
whether the use or structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe, respectively.
f. If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive loss, as defined
in Section 14-1-5 of this ordinance, it must not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
g. Any substantial improvement, as defined in Section 14-1-5 of this ordinance, to
a nonconforming structure requires that the existing structure and any additions
must meet the requirements of Section 14-1-7 and 14-1-8 of this ordinance for
new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway or
Flood Fringe District.
14-1-14 PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT
A. Violation Constitutes a Misdemeanor: Violation of the provisions of this
ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or
conditional uses) constitute a misdemeanor and will be punishable as defined by law.
B. Other Lawful Action: Nothing in this ordinance restricts the City from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. If the
responsible party does not appropriately respond to the Zoning Administrator within
the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses will constitute an
additional violation of this ordinance and will be prosecuted accordingly.
C. Enforcement: In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and City Council may utilize the full array of enforcement actions
available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, afterthe-
fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood
Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The
City must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance
violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
1. When a violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the
Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately investigate
the situation and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official
control. As soon as it is reasonably possible, this information will be submitted
to the appropriate State Department of Natural Resources and Federal
Emergency Management Agency regional office along with the city's plan of
action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
2. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the requirements
of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the
suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under
construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order the
construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the city. If the construction or development is already
completed, the Zoning Administrator may either: 1) issue an order identifying
October 2015 24
the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring
the use or structure into compliance with the official controls; or 2) notify the
responsible party to apply for an after the fact permit/development approval
within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days.
14-1-15 AMENDMENTS
A. Floodplain Designation – Restrictions on Removal: The floodplain designation on
the Official Zoning Map must not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be
shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the
elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands
outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the
Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) if the Commissioner
determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the
intended use.
B. Amendments Require DNR Approval: All amendments to this ordinance must be
submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) prior to adoption. The Commissioner must approve the
amendment prior to community approval.
C. Map Revisions Require Ordinance Amendments. The floodplain district regulations must
be amended to incorporate any revisions by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
the floodplain maps adopted in Section 14-1-4C of this ordinance.

the City consistent with authority granted the City to manage its Public Ways and Public Grounds under
state law, to the extent not inconsistent with a specific term of this Franchise.
3.2. Street Openings. Company shall not open or disturb the surface of any Public Way or
Public Ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, as required by title
eight, chapter two, of City Code, for which the City may impose a fee, unless the City is receiving a
franchise fee pursuant to this Ordinance, in which case all permit fees will be waived, so long as such City
Code and/or Ordinances comply with state law. If any term contained in a City Ordinance or City Code is
not in compliance with state law, state law shall control as to such noncompliant term. Permit conditions
imposed on Company shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other public-right-of-way users
for similar facilities or work. Company may, however, open and disturb the surface of any Public Way or
Public Ground without a permit if (i) an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Gas Facilities
and (ii) Company gives telephone, email or similar Notice to the City before commencement of the
emergency repair, if reasonably possible. Within three business days after commencing the repair,
Company shall apply for any required permits and pay any required fees.

Ordinance or City Code is not in compliance with state law, state law shall control as to such noncompliant
term.
3.7. Emergency Response. As emergency first-responders, when a public safety concern exists
both the City and Company shall respond to gas emergencies within the City without additional direct fee
or expense to either City or Company.
SECTION 4. RELOCATIONS.
4.1. Relocation in Public Ways and Public Grounds. The Company and City shall comply
with the provisions of Minnesota Rules 7819.3100 and title eight, chapter two of City Code, with respect to
requests for the Company to relocate Gas Facilities located in either Public Ways or Public Grounds, so
long as such City Code and/or Ordinances comply with state law. If any term contained in a City
Ordinance or City Code not in compliance with state law, state law shall control as to such noncompliant
term.
4.2. Projects with Federal Funding. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any Company
Gas Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a federally aided highway
project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes Sections 161.45 and 161.46 and title
eight, chapter two of City Code, so long as such City Code and/or Ordinances comply with state law. If any
term contained in a City Ordinance or City Code is not in compliance with state law, state law shall control
as to such noncompliant term.
SECTION 5. INDEMNIFICATION.
5.1. Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all
liability, on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction,
maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the Gas Facilities located in the
Public Ways and Public Grounds. The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned
through its own negligence or otherwise wrongful act or omission except for losses or claims arising out of
or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or
work.
5.2. Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where
this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit
if written Notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced
by lack of such Notice. If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of
such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or
immunity otherwise available to the City. The Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own
behalf. This Franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the City of any of its
defenses of immunity or limitations on liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.
SECTION 6. VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS AND PUBLIC GROUNDS.
The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written Notice of a proposed vacation of a
Public Ways or Public Grounds. The City and the Company shall comply with Minnesota Rules 7819.3100
and Minnesota Rules 7819.3200 with respect to any request for vacation.
SECTION 7. CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance.
Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company, succeed to all of the
rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.
SECTION 8. FRANCHISE FEE.
8.1. Form. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, the City may charge the Company a
franchise fee. The Company will administer the collection and payment of franchise fees to City, or other
fees that may otherwise be imposed on the Company in relation to its operations as a public utility in the
City. The franchise fee will be collected on a flat per meter basis, or by some other method that is mutually
acceptable to both City and Company for each retail customer within the corporate limits of the City. The
amount of the fee collected may differ for each customer class. The City will use a formula that provides a
stable and predictable amount of fees, without placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Such
fee shall not exceed any amount that the Company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to
the City. If the Company claims that the City required fee formula is discriminatory or otherwise places the
Company at a competitive disadvantage, the Company will provide a formula that will produce a
substantially similar fee amount to the City. If the City and Company are unable to agree, the disagreement
shall be subject to the Dispute Resolution provisions of this Ordinance.
8.2. Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate ordinance duly
adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least sixty (60) days after written
Notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon the Company by certified mail. The
Company is not required to collect a franchise fee if the terms of the fee agreement are inconsistent with
this franchise or state law, provided the Company notifies the City Council of the same within the sixty (60)
day period.
8.3. Condition of Fee. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against
the Company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or substantially similar amount on the sale of
energy within the City by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such supplier, the City has the
authority or contractual right to require a franchise fee or similar fee through an agreed-upon franchise.
8.4. Collection of Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable not less than quarterly during
complete billing months of the period for which payment is to be made. The franchise fee formula may be
changed from time to time, however, the change shall meet the same Notice and acceptance requirements
and the fee may not be changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any amount that the
Company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to the City. Such fee is subject to
subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles and customer refunds incurred by the Company. The
Company shall not be responsible to pay City fees that Company is unable to collect under Commission
rules or order. The Company agrees to make available for inspection by the City at reasonable times all
records necessary to audit the Company’s determination of the franchise fee payments.
8.5. Continuation of Franchise Fee. If this franchise expires and the City and the Company
are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise fee, if any being imposed by the City at the
time this franchise expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon. However, the
franchise fee will not remain in effect for more than one year after the franchise expires as stated in Section
2.6 of this Franchise. If for any reason the franchise terminates, the franchise fee will terminate at the same
time.
SECTION 9. ABANDONED FACILITIES.
The Company shall comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 216D.01 et seq. and Minnesota
Rules 7819.3300, as they may be amended from time to time with respect to abandoned facilities located

of all abandoned and retired Gas Facilities within the Public Ways and Public Grounds produce such
records at the City’s request and comply with the location requirements of Section 216D.04 with respect
to all Gas Facilities, including abandoned and retired Gas Facilities not located in Public Ways and
Public Grounds.
SECTION 10. PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE.
10.1. Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared separate
from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it
shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a provision of any other City ordinance
conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.
10.2. Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between
the City and Company as the only parties. No provisions herein shall in any way inure to the benefit of
any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party
beneficiary of this Ordinance or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any
cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
Either party may propose at any time that this Franchise Ordinance be amended. Franchise
Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions
of the amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company’s
written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 60 days after the effective date of the amendatory
ordinance. If the Company does not consent to the amendment, the ordinance containing the amendment
shall be revoked by City.

SECTION 2.
GRANT OF AUTHORITY AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 Grant of Franchise.
This Franchise is granted pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein and in
applicable law. The Grantee shall comply with all provisions of this Franchise and
applicable laws, regulations and codes. Failure of the Grantee to construct, operate
and maintain a System as described in this Franchise, or to meet obligations and
comply with all provisions herein, may be deemed a violation of this Franchise.
2.2 Grant of Nonexclusive Authority.
2.2.1 Subject to the terms of this Franchise, the City hereby grants the Grantee the
right to own, construct, operate and maintain a System along the right-of-way.
The grant of authority set forth in this Franchise applies only to the Grantee’s
provision of Cable Service; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the
Grantee’s ability to use the System for other purposes not inconsistent with
applicable law or with the provision of Cable Service; and provided further, that
any local, State and federal authorizations necessary for the Grantee’s use of the
System for other purposes are obtained by the Grantee. This Franchise does not
confer any rights other than as expressly provided herein, or as provided by
federal, State or local law. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed
by this Franchise or grant. The System constructed and maintained by Grantee
or its agents pursuant to this Franchise shall not interfere with other uses of the
right-of-way. The Grantee shall make use of existing poles and other aerial and
underground facilities available to the Grantee to the extent it is technically and
economically feasible to do so.
2.2.2 Notwithstanding the above grant to use rights-of-way, no right-of-way shall be
used by the Grantee if the City determines that such use us inconsistent with the
terms, conditions, or provisions by which such right-of-way was created or
dedicated, or with the present use of the right-of-way.
2.2.3 This Franchise and the right it grants to use and occupy the rights-of-way shall
not be exclusive and this Franchise does not, explicitly or implicitly, preclude the
issuance of other franchises or similar authorizations to operate Cable Systems
within the City. Provided, however, that the City shall not authorize or permit
another Person to construct, operate or maintain a Cable System on material
terms and conditions which are, taken as a whole, more favorable or less
burdensome than those applied to the Grantee.
2.2.4 This Franchise authorizes only the use of right-of-way. Therefore, the grant of
this Franchise and the payment of franchise fees hereunder shall not exempt the
Grantee from the obligation to pay compensation or fees for the use of City
property, both real and personal, other than the right-of-way; provided, however,
that such compensation or fees are required by City ordinance, regulation or
policy and are nondiscriminatory.
2.2.5 Should any other multi-channel video programming distributor (“MVPD”) over
which the City has regulatory jurisdiction provide Cable Service in the current
cable service area, the City shall not grant more favorable terms, taken as a
whole, to such MVPD than are granted to the Grantee. In the event that another
Person operates a Cable System authorized by the City on terms and conditions
that are, taken as a whole, more favorable or less burdensome than the terms
and conditions applicable to the Grantee under this Franchise, the City shall
adjust any such terms and conditions in any other Person’s authorization or this
Franchise so that the terms and conditions under which such Person operates,
taken as a whole, are not more favorable or less burdensome than those that are
applied to the Grantee.
2.3 Lease or Assignment Prohibited.
No Person may lease Grantee’s System for the purpose of providing Cable Service
until and unless such Person shall have first obtained and shall currently hold a valid
Franchise or other lawful authorization containing substantially similar burdens and
obligations to this Franchise, including, without limitation, a requirement on such
person to pay franchise fees on such person’s use of the System to provide Cable
Services, to the extent there would be such a requirement under this Franchise if the
Grantee itself were to use the System to provide such Cable Service. Any
assignment of rights under this Franchise shall be subject to and in accordance with
the requirements of this Franchise.
2.4 Franchise Term.
This Franchise shall be in effect for a period of fifteen (15) years, such term
commencing on the effective date specified in this Franchise, unless sooner
renewed, extended, revoked or terminated as herein provided.
2.5 Previous Franchises.
As of the effective date, this Franchise shall supercede and replace any previous
ordinance, as amended, of the City granting a Franchise to Grantee, including any
agreement(s) of the parties related thereto, except the Grantee shall continue to be
bound by any previously accrued but unfulfilled obligations under Ordinance No. 59
(the “Prior Franchise”) for which the Grantee had notice. The Grantee shall remain
liable for payments of all franchise fees and other amounts owed, and for all
unfulfilled actions that the Grantee was notified of and required to take under the
prior Franchise up to the effective date of this Franchise. The grant of this Franchise
shall have no effect on the Grantee’s duty under the prior franchise to indemnify or
insure the City against acts and omissions occurring during the period that the Prior
Franchise was in effect. This Franchise incorporates, amends and replaces that
Memorandum of Understanding dated December 22, 1994.
2.6 Compliance with Applicable Laws, Resolutions and Ordinances.
2.6.1 The terms of this Franchise shall define the contractual rights and obligations
of the Grantee with respect to the provision of Cable Service and operation of
the System in the City. However, the Grantee shall at all times during the
term of this Franchise be subject to the lawful exercise of the police powers of
the City, the City’s the right to adopt and enforce additional generally
applicable ordinances and regulations, and lawful and applicable zoning,
building, permitting and safety ordinances and regulations. The grant of this
Franchise does not relieve the Grantee of its obligations to obtain any
generally applicable licenses, permits or other authority as may be required
by the City Code, as it may be amended, for the privilege of operating a
business within the City or for performing work on City property or within the
right-of-way, to the extent not inconsistent with this Franchise. Except as
provided below, any modifications or amendment to this Franchise, or the
rights or obligations contained herein, must be within the lawful exercise of
the City’s police powers, as enumerated above, in which case the provision(s)
modified or amended herein shall be specifically referenced in an ordinance
of the City authorizing such amendment or modification. This Franchise may
also be modified or amended with the written consent of the Grantee as
provided in this Franchise.
2.6.2 The Grantee shall comply with the terms of any City ordinance or regulation
of general applicability which addresses usage of the right-of-way within the
City which may have the effect of superceding, modifying or amending the
terms of Section 3 and/or Section 8.5.3 herein; except that the Grantee shall
not, through application of such City ordinance or regulation of rights-of-way,
be subject to additional burdens with respect to usage of rights-of-way that
exceed burdens on similarly situated right-of-way users.
2.6.3 In the event of any conflict between Section 3 and/or Section 8.5.3 of this
Franchise and any lawfully applicable City ordinance or regulation which
addresses usage of the right-of-way, the conflicting terms in Section 3 and/or
Section 8.5.3 of this Franchise shall be superceded by such City ordinances
or regulations; except that the Grantee shall not, through application of such
City ordinance or regulation of right-of-way, be subject to additional burdens
with respect to usage of public rights-of-way that exceed burdens on similarly
situated right-of-way users.
2.6.4 In the event any lawfully applicable City ordinance or regulation which
addresses usage of the rights-of-way adds to, modifies, amends, or otherwise
differently addresses issues addressed in Section 3 and/or Section 8.5.3 of
this Franchise, the Grantee shall comply with such ordinance or regulation of
general applicability, regardless of which requirement was first adopted;
except that the Grantee shall not, through application of such City ordinance
or regulation of rights-of-way, be subject to additional burdens with respect to
usage of rights-of-way that exceed burdens on similarly situated rights-of-way
users.
2.6.5 In the event the Grantee cannot determine how to comply with any right-ofway
requirement of the City, whether pursuant to this Franchise or other
requirement, the Grantee shall immediately provide written notice of such
question, including the Grantee’s proposed interpretation, to the City. The
City shall provide a written response within ten (10) business days of receipt
indicating how the requirements cited by the Grantee apply. The Grantee
may proceed in accordance with its proposed interpretation in the event a
written response is not received within thirteen (13) business days of mailing
or delivering such written question.
2.7 Rules of Grantee.
The Grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and
conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to
enable said Grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this
Franchise and applicable law, and to assure uninterrupted service to each and all of
its Subscribers; provided that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not
be in conflict with provisions hereto, the rules of the FCC, the laws of the State of
Minnesota, the City, or any other body having lawful jurisdiction.
2.8 Territorial Area Involved.
This Franchise is granted for the corporate boundaries of the City, as they exist from
time to time, provided, however, that the Grantee shall not be required to extend
service beyond its present System boundaries except pursuant to the line extension
requirement set forth in this Franchise.

health, safety or property, as reasonably determined by the City, the City, after
providing notice to the Grantee, if it is reasonably feasible to do so, may remove
or relocate any or all parts of the System at no expense to the City, other than
the City’s costs to act on such determination.
3.4 Use of Existing Poles and Undergrounding of Cable.
3.4.1 Where existing poles, underground conduits, ducts or wire holding structures are
available for use by the Grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such
use, the City may require, through the established permit, or any other applicable
procedure, the Grantee to use such existing poles and wire holding structures if
the City determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and
the terms available to the Grantee for the use of such poles and structures are
just and reasonable.
3.4.2 The Grantee agrees to place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground,
in the manner as may be required by the provisions of the City Code and City
policies, procedures, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, where
all utility facilities are placed underground. The Grantee shall not place facilities,
equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any existing gas, electric,
telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities or with any existing installations
of the City, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various existing utilities
serving the residents of the City. To the extent consistent with the City Code,
City policies, procedures, rules and regulations, System cable and facilities may
be constructed overhead where poles exist and electric or telephone lines or both
are now overhead. However, in no case may the Grantee install poles in areas
of the City where underground facilities are generally used by the utilities already
operating. If the City, at a future date, requires all electric and telephone lines to
be placed underground in all or part of the City, the Grantee shall, within a
reasonable time, similarly move its cables and lines, at no expense to the City,
and shall not seek damages from the City for such compliance.

considered a vested fee interest in the rights-of-way or in City property.
Whenever feasible, all transmission and distribution structures, lines, wires,
cables, equipment and poles or other fixtures erected by the Grantee within the
City are to be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the
rights and convenience of property owners.
3.6 Safety Requirements.
3.6.1 All applicable safety practices required by law shall be used during construction,
maintenance and repair of the System. The Grantee agrees, at all times, to
employ ordinary and reasonable care and to install and maintain in use
commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents
that are likely to cause damage or injuries to the public or to property. All
structures and all lines, equipment and connections in the rights-of-way shall at
all times be kept and maintained in a safe condition, consistent with applicable
safety codes.

Franchise, the Grantee shall identify the location of its facilities for the City at no
charge to the City.
3.7 City Use of Facilities.
The City, after consultation with the Grantee, shall have the right to use for its sole
noncommercial purposes the Grantee’s poles, conduits, ducts, and manholes free of
charge provided that such current or continued use will not unreasonably interfere with
the present or future needs or operations of the Grantee.
3.8 Removal of Facilities at Expiration of Franchise.
At the expiration of the term for which this Franchise is granted, or upon the expiration
of any renewal or extension period which may be granted, the City shall have the right
to require the Grantee, at the Grantee’s sole expense: (i) to remove all portions of the
System from all rights-of-way within the City; and (ii) to restore affected sites to their
original condition. Should the Grantee fail, refuse or neglect to comply with the City’s
directive, all portions of the System, or any part thereof, may at the option of the City
become the sole property of the City, at no expense to the City or be removed, altered
or relocated by the City at the cost of the Grantee. The City shall not be liable to the
Grantee for damages resulting from such removal, alteration or relocation.

related to the System Upgrade, the Grantee shall seek to identify
the non-video interests of the business community within the City
and shall seek to quantify business community demand for nonvideo
services. Prior to making any final determination of such
demand, the Grantee shall solicit input from the City regarding the
location of business corridors that may desire such services. The
Grantee shall, in connection with the System Upgrade, install
conduit adequately sized to address future System rebuilds or
System additions, with the intent to obviate the need to reopen the
rights-of-way for construction and installation work.
4.1.10 The City may request, as part of the System Upgrade, that the
Grantee remove from the rights-of-way, at its own expense, existing
equipment, plant and facilities that will not be used in the future,

remains in rights-of-way after such City request and the Grantee’s
reasonable opportunity to remove, the City may remove such plant,
facilities and equipment at the Grantee’s expense. The Grantee
may appeal any request to remove existing equipment, plant and
facilities to the City Council and thereby stay City action until a final
decision is issued by the City Council. In the event existing facilities,
plant and equipment are left underground in the rights-of-way, the
City may require the Grantee to provide accurate maps showing the
location and the nature of the deactivated or unused facilities, plant
and equipment, if such information has not already been provided to
the City.

facilitate the extension of service by requiring developers and utility
companies to provide the Grantee with at least fifteen (15) days advance
notice of an available open trench for the placement of necessary cable,
but in no event shall the City have any liability for its failure to require any
Person to provide notice, or for any developer’s or utility company’s failure
to provide advance notice hereunder.
4.5.3 In the event that the requirements set forth in Subsection 4.5.2 are not met,
Persons requesting service can be required to bear the remainder of the total
construction costs on a pro rata basis.
4.5.3.1 The “total construction costs” are defined as the Actual Cost to construct

The Commission shall have the right to rename, reprogram or otherwise change
the use of these channels at any time, in its sole discretion, provided such use is
Noncommercial and public, educational, governmental or religious in nature.
Nothing herein shall diminish any rights of the Commission to secure additional
PEG channels pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 238.084, which is expressly incorporated
herein by reference.
6.1.3 Public Access Channel 15 and Government Access Channel 16 shall not be
relocated without the consent of the Commission. If the Commission agrees to
change the channel designation for Public Access Channel 15 and/or
Government Access Channel 16, the Grantee must provide at least three (3)
months notice to the Commission prior to implementing the change, and shall
reimburse the City, the Commission and/or PEG entity for any reasonable costs
incurred for: (i) purchasing or modifying equipment, business cards, and signage;
(ii) any marketing and notice of the channel change that the Commission, the
City and/or PEG entity reasonably determines is necessary; (iii) logo changes;
and (iv) promoting, marketing and advertising the channel location of the affected
PEG channel(s) during the twelve-month period preceding the effective date of
the channel change. Alternatively, the Grantee may choose to supply necessary
equipment itself, provided such equipment is satisfactory to the City, the
Commission or PEG entity.
6.1.4 Prior to the completion of the System Upgrade, the Grantee shall have the right
to relocate each of the PEG channels (other than Public Access Channel 15 and
Government Access Channel 16), one time without the Commission’s consent,
and without reimbursing the City or the Commission for any costs it incurs as a
result of the relocation. If a qualified PEG channel has been relocated once
without Commission approval, that channel may not be moved again unless: (i)
the Commission has consented to the move; and (ii) the Grantee reimburses the
Commission, the City and/or a PEG entity for all reasonable costs of such move,
as described below, and provides at least three (3) months notice to the
Commission, the City and/or PEG entity before making the change in channel
designation. After the System Upgrade is completed, no PEG channel shall be
relocated without the mutual consent of the Commission and the Grantee. If the
Grantee and the Commission agree to change the channel designation for a
PEG channel, the Grantee must provide at least three (3) months notice to the
Commission prior to implementing the change, and shall reimburse the City, the
Commission and/or PEG entity for any reasonable costs incurred for: (i)
purchasing or modifying equipment, business cards, and signage; (ii) any
marketing and notice of the channel change that the City and/or the Commission
reasonably determines is necessary; (iii) logo changes; and (iv) promoting,
marketing and advertising the channel location of the affected PEG channel(s)
during the twelve-month period preceding the effective date of the channel
change. Alternatively, the Grantee may choose to supply necessary equipment
itself, provided such equipment is satisfactory to the City, the Commission or
PEG entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Grantee shall not be
required to repay any school for any on-premises school expenses that arise out
of any PEG channel relocation.
6.1.5 As long as the Grantee’s System carries Basic Cable Service channels in analog
form, the Grantee must make the PEG channels available in analog form to
Subscribers within the City. If and when the Grantee’s Cable System carries
PEG channels in digital form, those digital PEG channels must be made
available as a digital service to all Subscribers in the City. At all times, the
Grantee’s Cable System must make the PEG channels available to all Basic
Cable Service Subscribers residing within the City in at least one format (digital
or analog); thus, the Grantee shall make the PEG channels available to all such
Subscribers in analog form unless and until it makes Basic Cable Service
channels available to Subscribers only in digital form. If the Grantee opts to carry
PEG channels in a digital format, it shall assume the cost of replacing all
equipment necessary to ensure that PEG signals can be produced and
transmitted on the Grantee’s digital service tier.
6.1.6 In the event the Grantee makes any change in the System and related
equipment and facilities or in signal delivery technology, which change directly or
indirectly causes the signal quality or transmission of PEG channel programming
or PEG services to fall below technical standards under applicable law, the
Grantee shall, at its own expense, provide any necessary technical assistance,
transmission equipment, and training of PEG personnel, and in addition, provide
necessary assistance so that PEG facilities may be used as intended, including,
among other things, so that live and taped programming can be cablecasted
efficiently to Subscribers.
6.1.7 All PEG channels shall be transmitted in the same format as all other Basic
Cable Service channels and shall be carried on the Basic Service tier.
6.1.8 The Commission shall be responsible for switching PEG signals and Institutional
Network transmissions.
6.2 PEG Support Obligations.
6.2.1 In addition to the franchise fee required under this Franchise, the Grantee shall
collect from Subscribers via an itemization on customer bills (“PEG Fee”) and
pay quarterly to the Commission an amount equal to 2.5 percent of its Gross
Revenues (the “Quarterly Support Grant”). Payment of the Quarterly Support
Grant shall be made to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the end of each
of the Grantee’s fiscal quarters together with a report showing the basis for the
computation. The Commission shall have the right to require further supporting
information for each Quarterly Support Grant. All amounts paid under this
paragraph shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the Commission in
accordance with the rights provided to the City pursuant to Section 8.3 of this
Franchise.
6.2.2 In addition to the Quarterly Support Grant, the Grantee shall make the following
capital support payments:
6.2.2.1 a one-time payment of $200,000 (the “Initial Capital Support Grant”) to be
used for PEG facilities and/or PEG equipment (including, but not limited
to, studio and portable production equipment, editing equipment and
program playback equipment). Payment of the Initial Capital Support
Grant shall be made to the Commission in one lump sum within fifteen
(15) days after the Effective Date of this Franchise. The Commission, in
its sole discretion, shall allocate the Initial Capital Support Grant.
6.2.2.2 a one-time payment of $300,000 (“Supplemental Capital Support Grant I”)
to be used for PEG facilities and/or equipment (including, but not limited
to, studio and portable production equipment, editing equipment and
program playback equipment). Payment of Supplemental Capital Support
Grant I shall be made to the Commission in one lump sum ninety (90)
days after the Effective Date of this Franchise. The Commission, in its
sole discretion, shall allocate Supplemental Capital Support Grant I.
6.2.2.3 a one-time payment of $200,000 (“Supplemental Capital Support Grant
II”), adjusted by CPI, to be used for PEG facilities and/or equipment
(including, but not limited to, studio and portable production equipment,
editing equipment and program playback equipment). Payment of
Supplemental Capital Support Grant II shall be made to the Commission
in one lump on the second anniversary of the Effective Date of this
Franchise.
The Commission, in its sole discretion, shall allocate Supplemental Capital
Support Grant II.
6.2.2.4 an annual equipment grant of $40,000 (the “Equipment Grant”), to be
allocated by the Commission in its sole discretion. The Equipment Grant
shall be increased by CPI on an annual basis, and shall be paid to the
Commission no later than January 15 of each year beginning in 2001.
6.2.2.5 The Grantee may (i) treat the Initial Capital Support Grant, Supplemental
Capital Support Grant I, Supplemental Capital Support Grant II and the
Equipment Grant as a franchise requirement and (ii) pass the amount paid
pursuant to this paragraph through to Subscribers as an external cost, and
may itemize the amount attributable to these grants on Subscribers’
monthly bills, either as part of the PEG Fee or as a separate line item, all
in accordance with applicable federal law.
6.2.3 In the event any payment required by this Section 6.2 is not made on or before
the required date, the Grantee shall pay, during the period such unpaid amount is
owed, additional compensation and interest charges computed from such due
date, at an annual rate of ten percent (10%). The Grantee waives any rights to
claim that any interest or penalties imposed hereunder constitute franchise fees
within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. §542. Failure to pay required amounts shall also
be a violation of this Franchise, subject to all sanctions herein.
6.2.4 The Grantee and the City agree that in the event of a federal or State statutory
change that entirely eliminates the Grantee’s obligation to pay a franchise fee,
then the Grantee shall continue to pay to the City as PEG support an amount
equivalent to the prior year’s franchise fee. Said PEG support shall continue for
one (1) year during which time the Grantee and the City shall engage in good
faith negotiations regarding PEG support obligations. This paragraph shall not
apply if the Grantee is required to pay a franchise fee to another entity (including,
but not limited to, the State) rather than to the City.
6.2.5 The Grantee shall provide, at the time of the System Upgrade, at no cost to the
City, the Commission and I-Net Users, the fiber-optic or other cabling, switching
systems and other electronics, equipment, software and other materials
necessary to route (i) PEG signals from their origination point through the
Commission’s master control to the appropriate subscriber network channel,
including channels provided discretely, and (ii) I-Net signals to and from
institutions and to and from institutions to Subscribers. The Grantee shall
continue to have this obligation regardless of where the Commission’s master
control or the pertinent headend or hub is located. Provided, however, if the
Commission moves its master control from 737 East River Road, Anoka,
Minnesota, it shall reimburse the Grantee for the Actual Cost of any additional
facilities that need to be constructed or provided to transport the signals to the
new location.

Franchise, unless the Grantee (or its successors) and the Commission mutually
agree to suspend or terminate the Universal PEG Tier program.
6.5.3 The Grantee agrees to provide, at no cost to Universal PEG Tier Subscribers, an
A/B switch and all cable-related equipment necessary to allow reception of local
broadcast stations on a Universal PEG Tier Subscriber’s television receiver,
provided said television receiver is capable of receiving broadcast television
signals. For purposes of this provision the term “cable-related equipment” shall
not include antennas, antenna wires, video cassette recorders or similar devices.
6.5.4 The Grantee and the City agree that the rates charged to Subscribers will not
increase as a result of the Grantee’s implementation of the Universal PEG Tier
program, except that the Grantee may pass the expense of the Universal PEG
Tier through to Subscribers as an external cost, and may itemize the amount
attributable to the Universal PEG Tier on Subscribers’ monthly billing statements.
The amount recovered by the Grantee each month shall not exceed $0.07 per
Subscriber, and shall not reduce the amount of the PEG support furnished to the
Commission and the City under this Franchise. The Grantee shall, on an annual
basis, provide the City with a reconciliation of amounts collected and expended
related to the provision of the Universal PEG Tier. The Grantee agrees to adjust
the Universal PEG Tier fee for any overpayment or underpayment.
6.5.5 Notice of the availability of the Universal PEG Tier shall be provided in the
informational package that is provided to Subscribers on an annual basis, and in
promotional materials that shall be sent to potential Subscribers each year.
6.5.6 Should a Universal PEG Tier Subscriber require or request a set-top terminal
device or other equipment not essential to the reception of the Universal PEG
Tier, or should a Universal PEG Tier Subscriber require a Drop that exceeds 150
feet in length, the Universal PEG Tier Subscriber shall be responsible for paying
the regulated charges for such equipment, and for the additional costs
associated with installing a drop in excess of 150 feet. “Additional costs,” as
used in this paragraph, shall mean the Grantee’s total Installation costs, less the
Installation costs that the Grantee would incur by constructing a standard 150-
foot Drop.
6.5.7 For purposes of this Section 6.5, the following definitions shall apply:
6.5.7.1 “Universal PEG Tier” shall mean all PEG channels identified in this
Franchise or subsequently added pursuant to the Franchise.
6.5.7.2 “Drop” shall mean an aerial or underground cable, not to exceed 150 feet
in length, that runs from the nearest connection point on a feeder cable to
the point of connection in a Subscriber’s dwelling unit.
6.6 Costs and Payments not Franchise Fees.
The parties agree that any costs to the Grantee associated with the provision of support
for PEG access or the Institutional Network pursuant to Section 6 and 7 of this
Franchise do not constitute and are not part of a franchise fee and fall within one or
more of the exceptions to 47 U.S.C. § 542.

its departments and agencies), the Commission and all institutions located at the
I-Net Sites shall have exclusive use of all I-Net capacity, to the extent provided in
subsection 7.2. I-Net Users may not sell or resell services or capacity to any
third party. However, I-Net Users may provide video, voice and data services to
themselves, including those which the Grantee otherwise sells to others. The
limitations of this paragraph shall not prevent I-Net Users from subleasing,
bartering, selling, reselling or giving away capacity on the Institutional Network to
any other public or nonprofit entity for noncommercial purposes that do not
directly compete with any products or services offered by the Grantee.
7.1.2 The I-Net shall provide 450 MHz of activated capacity with no less than 54
standard video (6 MHz) channels (at least 23 upstream channels and at least 31
downstream channels) to the I-Net Sites. The entire I-Net shall be tested before
the date of I-Net activation. If any segment does not pass the Grantee’s
performance test(s), the Grantee shall take all steps necessary to meet
applicable standards, and the affected segment shall be retested. At the

Exhibit A, at no cost to the City, the Commission or I-Net Users. Other
governmental, public or educational institutions subsequently designated by the
City shall be connected to the I-Net via coaxial cable, free of charge, if the
designated institution is located less than five hundred (500) feet from the
existing I-Net, or if such designated institution agrees to reimburse the Grantee
for its Actual Costs in excess of the cost of the first 500 feet of such installation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any new City Hall facilities shall be connected to
the I-Net via coaxial cable at no charge to the City, the Commission or any other
I-Net Users.
7.1.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Franchise, the Grantee shall
connect the Ramsey Fire Department building located at 15050 Armstrong
Boulevard , NW, Ramsey, Minnesota (the “Ramsey Fire Hall”) to the I-Net (the
“Ramsey Fire Hall I-Net Connection”). In accordance with this Franchise, the
Ramsey Fire Hall I-Net Connection shall be completed and successfully activated
consistent with the diagram attached as Exhibit C no later than December 31,
2002. If at the time of the I-Net upgrade the Ramsey Fire Hall will continue to
house Ramsey’s City Council chambers for a period of at least twelve more
months, the Grantee shall construct, equip and activate the Ramsey Fire Hall INet
Connection at no charge to the City, the Commission or other I-Net Users.
However, if at the time of the I-Net Upgrade Ramsey’s City Council chambers will
continue to be housed in the Ramsey Fire Hall for less than twelve months, the
Commission or the appropriate I-Net User shall reimburse the Grantee for its
Actual Cost of installing the Ramsey Fire Hall I-Net Connection in excess of the
Actual Cost of the first 500 feet of construction from the existing Institutional
Network. Prior to the activation of the Ramsey Fire Hall I-Net Connection, the
Grantee shall provide Ramsey with the following: (i) sufficient upstream
bandwidth on the subscriber network to transport a 6 MHz analog video channel
to Grantee’s headend or hub, as appropriate; and (ii) all transmission equipment
and materials necessary to originate and transmit video signals from the Ramsey
Fire Hall through the Grantee’s System to Ramsey’s discrete Governmental
Access Channel (collectively, the “Temporary Upstream Feed”) and then on to
Subscribers. The Grantee shall complete and activate the Temporary Upstream
Feed no later than the Effective Date of this Franchise. The Temporary
Upstream Feed shall remain fully operational until such time as the Ramsey Fire
Hall I-Net Connection passes all applicable tests, as specified in subsection
7.1.2, and is successfully activated. At all times, the combination of the
downstream subscriber network and the Temporary Upstream Feed or the
Ramsey Fire Hall I-Net Connection shall meet or exceed FCC technical
standards at all Subscriber locations. The Grantee shall provide, install and
maintain the Temporary Upstream Feed at no charge to the City, the
Commission or I-Net Users. The Grantee may pass all direct costs associated
with the Ramsey Fire Hall I-Net Connection and the Temporary Upstream Feed
through to all Subscribers as an external cost and may itemize such costs on all
Subscribers’ monthly billing statements as part of the PEG Fee or as a separate
line item entitled “institutional network,” all in accordance with applicable law.
7.1.6 I-Net Users shall be responsible for providing any end-user or interface
equipment needed for transmission or reception of signals. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grantee shall, at the Commission’s request, provide at no charge
to the City, the Commission or I-Net Users up to twenty (20) new modulators for
City and/or Commission use.
7.2 Grantee’s Use of I-Net Capacity.
The I-Net shall be for the exclusive use of the City, the Commission and other I-Net
Users throughout the term of the Franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee
may use capacity on the I-Net, including for lease or other commercial purposes,
provided that the City, the Commission and I-Net Users are not using such capacity and
further provided that the Grantee’s use does not interfere with use of the I-Net by the
City, the Commission, or I-Net Users. Upon receiving oral or written notice from the
Commission, the Grantee or a lessee shall immediately cease using the I-Net for any
purpose that the Commission, in its sole discretion, determines is interfering with I-Net
Users’ communications. Use of the I-Net by the City, the Commission and I-Net Users
shall, at all times, have priority over any use(s) by the Grantee or any lessee. The
Grantee or a lessee shall terminate its use of any channel capacity on the I-Net within
three (3) months after receiving notice from the Commission that the City, the
Commission or any I-Net User has determined to use such capacity. Any agreement
entered into by the Grantee and a third party for the lease of I-Net capacity shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Franchise.
7.3 I-Net Performance Standards.
The Grantee shall maintain the I-Net in accordance with technical and performance
standards set forth in Exhibit B (I-Net Performance Standards), which is made a part
hereof. The Grantee shall provide the City, or its designee, upon request, with reports
of the performance of the I-Net and the Grantee’s compliance with the aforementioned
technical and performance standards.
7.4 Institutional Network Security.
The Grantee and the Commission shall at all times use reasonable efforts to protect the
security of the Institutional Network. For purposes of this paragraph, “to protect
security” means to protect those physical elements of the Institutional Network under
the party’s direct control from unauthorized intrusion, signal theft, tampering,
wiretapping or other actions that might: (i) compromise the integrity of or degrade the
signals carried over the Institutional Network; or (ii) result in the unauthorized
interception and disclosure of information.
7.5 Interconnection and Use of Adjacent Institutional Networks.
7.5.1 Concurrent with the System Upgrade, the Grantee shall construct interconnection
links to the Institutional Networks of Grantee’s Systems serving: (i) the City of
Coon Rapids, Minnesota; (ii) the member cities of the North Metro
Telecommunications Commission; and (iii) the member cities of the Northwest
Suburban Cable Communication Commission (“Adjacent Institutional Networks”).
Each interconnection link shall be completed within a reasonable timeframe
mutually agreed upon by the Commission and the Grantee, unless an extension
is granted upon petition by the Grantee. The Grantee shall be responsible for
switching all signals carried over the interconnection links described in this
paragraph, including signals that are originated by or intended for the City,
Commission or I-Net Users.
7.5.2 Every interconnection link established pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall, at a
minimum: (A) use a fiber optic transmission medium (B) allow for the seamless
transmission of all required I-Net signals on both systems; and (C) provide, for
the Commission’s exclusive use, at least one (1) 6 MHz analog channel for
forward video purposes, one (1) 6 MHz analog channel for return video
purposes, one (1) 6 MHz channel for forward data and/or other purposes and
one (1) 6 MHz analog channel for return data and/or other purposes.
7.5.3 The Grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional
interconnection authority, or state or federal agency which may be hereafter
established for the purpose of regulating, facilitating, financing or otherwise
providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the
City.
7.5.4 At the Commission’s request, the Grantee shall use its best efforts to obtain any
required authorization from the North Metro Telecommunications Commission,
the Northwest Suburban Cable Commission and the City of Coon Rapids,
Minnesota (the “Adjacent Commissions”) that is necessary to allow the
Commission, the City and I-Net Users to utilize capacity on the Adjacent
Institutional Networks. In the event the Grantee is unable to obtain such
authorization after using its best efforts, or if the Adjacent Institutional Networks
are not under the control of the Adjacent Commissions, the Grantee shall provide
the Commission, the City and/or I-Net Users with available bandwidth on the
Adjacent Institutional Networks, free of charge, as follows: if capacity on the
Adjacent Institutional Networks is available and under the Grantee’s control (or if
the Grantee has I-Net capacity available to it under the terms of its franchises
with the Adjacent Commissions) the Grantee shall dedicate and furnish for
Commission, City or I-Net User use the greater of 12 MHz of bandwidth, or the
maximum amount of bandwidth available and under Grantee’s control, up to 12
MHz. Upon request, the Grantee shall make additional Adjacent Institutional
Network capacity available to the Commission, the City and I-Net Users at Actual
Cost, provided that additional bandwidth is available and under the Grantee’s
control. In no event shall Grantee have any obligation or be responsible for
providing any additional equipment as a result of this subsection.
7.6 Subscriber Network Drops to Designated Buildings.

7.6.2 The Grantee shall provide Basic Cable Service and any equipment necessary to
receive such service, free of charge, to those institutions currently receiving
Basic Cable Service, and the institutions identified and designated for such
service in Exhibit A. Institutions currently receiving additional Cable Services
from the Grantee, free of charge, shall continue to receive those same services,
or comparable services, during the term of this Franchise, free of charge.
7.6.3 Additional subscriber network Drops and/or outlets will be installed at designated
institutions by the Grantee on an Actual Cost basis. Alternatively, said institution
may add outlets at its own expense, as long as such Installation meets the
Grantee’s standards. The Grantee shall have three (3) months from the date of
City designation of additional institution(s) to complete construction of the Drop
and outlet, unless weather or other conditions beyond the control of the Grantee
require more time.

quarters together with a report showing the basis for the computation. The City
shall have the right to require further supporting information for each franchise

The Grantee shall maintain such records for five (5) years, unless in the
Grantee’s ordinary course of business specific records are retained for a shorter
period, but in no event less than three (3) years. If an audit discloses an
overpayment or underpayment of franchise fees, the City shall notify the Grantee
of such overpayment or underpayment. The City’s audit expenses shall be borne
by the City unless the audit determines that the payment to the City should be
increased by more than five percent (5%) in the audited period, in which case the
costs of the audit shall be borne by the Grantee as a cost incidental to the
enforcement of the Franchise. Any additional amounts due to the City as a result
of the audit shall be paid to the City within thirty (30) days following written notice
to the Grantee by the City of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy
of the audit report. If the re-computation results in additional revenue to be paid

charge. If the audit determines that there has been an overpayment by the
Grantee, the Grantee may credit any overpayment against its next quarterly

impose any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability.
8.3.6 The franchise fee payments required by this Franchise shall be in addition to any
and all taxes or fees of general applicability. The Grantee shall not have or make
any claim for any deduction or other credit of all or any part of the amount of said
franchise fee payments from or against any of said taxes or fees of general
applicability, except as expressly permitted by law. The Grantee shall not apply
nor seek to apply all or any part of the amount of said franchise fee payments as
a deduction or other credit from or against any of said taxes or fees of general
applicability, except as expressly permitted by law. Nor shall the Grantee apply
or seek to apply all or any part of the amount of any of said taxes or fees of
general applicability as a deduction or other credit from or against any of its
franchise fee obligations, except as expressly permitted by law.

8.6.1 The City may require evaluation sessions at any time during the term of this
Franchise, upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the Grantee.

Grantee under this Franchise. The drawing on the Letter of Credit by the City,
and use of the money so obtained for payment or performance of the obligations,
duties and responsibilities of the Grantee that are in default, shall not be a waiver
or release of such default.
9.2.10 The collection by City of any damages, monies or penalties from the Letter of
Credit shall not affect any other right or remedy available to it, nor shall any act,
or failure to act, by the City pursuant to the Letter of Credit, be deemed a waiver

reconstruction of a sewer or water system.
9.3.4 Related only to PEG programming, the Grantee shall not be required to

complete payment of such costs and fees by the transferee. Grantee may not

enforce noncompliance issues relating to this Franchise.
10.5.10 Any transfer or sale of the Franchise without the prior written consent of
the City shall be considered to impair the City’s assurance of due performance.
The granting of approval for a transfer or sale in one instance shall not render

GRANT OF AUTHORITY AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 Grant of Franchise.
This Franchise is granted pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein and in
applicable law. The Grantee shall comply with all provisions of this Franchise and
applicable laws, regulations and codes. Failure of the Grantee to construct, operate and
maintain a System as described in this Franchise, or to meet obligations and comply with
all provisions herein, may be deemed a violation of this Franchise.
2.2 Grant of Nonexclusive Authority.
2.2.1 Subject to the terms of this Franchise, the City hereby grants the Grantee the right
to own, construct, operate and maintain a System along the Rights-of-Way. The
grant of authority set forth in this Franchise applies only to the Grantee's provision
of Cable Service; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the Grantee's
ability to use the System for other purposes not inconsistent with applicable law or
with the provision of Cable Service; and provided further, that any local, State and
federal authorizations necessary for the Grantee's use of the System for other
purposes are obtained by the Grantee. This Franchise does not confer any rights
other than as expressly provided herein, or as provided by federal, State or local
law. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed by this Franchise or
grant. The System constructed and maintained by Grantee or its agents pursuant to
this Franchise shall not interfere with other uses of the Rights-of-Way. The Grantee
shall make use of existing poles and other aerial and underground facilities
available to the Grantee to the extent it is technically and economically feasible to
83
Error! Unknown document property name.
do so. However, the City and Grantee acknowledge that QC owns and operates
facilities in the Rights-of-Way which will be utilized by Grantee to provide Cable
Services. So long as QC does not provide Cable Service to Subscribers in the City,
QC will not be subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions contained in
this Franchise. QC's installation and maintenance of facilities in the Rights-of-
Way is governed by applicable local, state and federal law. To the extent Grantee
constructs and installs facilities in the Rights-of-Way, such facilities and operation
of such facilities will be subject to the terms and conditions contained in this
Franchise. The City and Company agree that to the extent QC violates any
applicable federal, state, or local laws, rules, and regulations, the City shall seek
compliance directly from QC. In the event, the City cannot resolve these violations
or disputes with QC, the City may look to Grantee to ensure such compliance.
Failure by Grantee to ensure QC's or any other Affiliate's compliance with
applicable local, state and federal laws, rules, and regulations shall be deemed a
material breach of this Franchise by Grantee.
2.2.2 Notwithstanding the above grant to use Rights-of-Way, no Right-of-Way shall be
used by the Grantee if the City determines that such use is inconsistent with the
terms, conditions, or provisions by which such Right-of-Way was created or
dedicated, or with the present use of the Right-of-Way.
2.2.3 This Franchise and the right it grants to use and occupy the Rights-of-Way shall
not be exclusive and this Franchise does not, explicitly or implicitly, preclude
the issuance of other franchises or similar authorizations to operate Cable
Systems within the City. Provided, however, that the City shall not authorize or
permit another Person to construct, operate or maintain a Cable System on material
terms and conditions which are, taken as a whole, more favorable or less burdensome
than those applied to the Grantee.
2.2.4 This Franchise authorizes only the use of Rights-of-Way. Therefore, the grant
of this Franchise and the payment of franchise fees hereunder shall not exempt
the Grantee from the obligation to pay compensation or fees for the use of City
property, both real and personal, other than the Rights-of-Way; provided, however,
that such compensation or fees are required by City ordinance, regulation or policy
and are nondiscriminatory.
2.2.5 Should any other multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") over
which the City has regulatory jurisdiction provide Cable Service in the current Cable
Service area, the City shall not grant more favorable terms, taken as a whole, to such
MVPD than are granted to the Grantee. In the event that another Person operates a
Cable System authorized by the City on terms and conditions that are, taken as a
whole, more favorable or less burdensome than the terms and conditions applicable
to the Grantee under this Franchise, the City shall adjust any such terms and
conditions in any other Person's authorization or this Franchise so that the terms
and conditions under which such Person operates, taken as a whole, are not more
favorable or less burdensome than those that are applied to the Grantee.
2.3 Lease or Assignment Prohibited.
84
Error! Unknown document property name.
No Person may lease Grantee's System for the purpose of providing Cable Service until
and unless such Person shall have first obtained and shall currently hold a valid Franchise
or other lawful authorization containing substantially similar burdens and obligations to
this Franchise, including, without limitation, a requirement on such Person to pay franchise
fees on such Person's use of the System to provide Cable Services, to the extent there
would be such a requirement under this Franchise if the Grantee itself were to use the
System to provide such Cable Service. Any assignment of rights under this Franchise
shall be subject to and in accordance with the requirements of this Franchise.
2.4 Franchise Term.
The Franchise term shall commence on the Effective Date specified in this Franchise. The
term of this Franchise shall be ten (10) years from the Effective Date specified in this
Franchise.

2.5.1 The terms of this Franchise shall define the contractual rights and obligations of the
Grantee with respect to the provision of Cable Service and operation of the
System in the City. However, the Grantee shall at all times during the term
of this Franchise be subject to the lawful exercise of the police powers of the
City, the City's the right to adopt and enforce additional generally applicable
ordinances and regulations, and lawful and applicable zoning, building,
permitting and safety ordinances and regulations. The grant of this Franchise
does not relieve the Grantee of its obligations to obtain any generally
applicable licenses, permits or other authority as may be required by the City
Code, as it may be amended, for the privilege of operating a business within the
City or for performing work on City property or within the Rights-of-Way, to
the extent not inconsistent with this Franchise. Except as provided below,
any modification or amendment to this Franchise, or the rights or obligations
contained herein, must be within the lawful exercise of the City's police powers,

herein shall be specifically referenced in an ordinance of the City authorizing

modify the build out requirements set forth in Sections 4.3.1(ii) and 4.3.1(iii) herein
without the Grantee’s consent.
2.5.2 The Grantee shall comply with the terms of any City ordinance or
regulation of general applicability which addresses usage of the Rights-of-
Way within the City which may have the effect of superseding, modifying
or amending the terms of Section 3 and/or Section 8.5.3 herein; except that
the Grantee shall not, through application of such City ordinance or
regulation of Rights-of-Way, be subject to additional burdens with respect to
usage of Rights-of-Way that exceed burdens on similarly situated Right-of-
Way users. In no event shall the City adopt or amend any City ordinance or
85

regulation so as to modify the build out requirements set forth in Sections
4.3.1(ii) and 4.3.1(iii) herein without the Grantee’s consent.

Franchise and any lawfully applicable City ordinance or regulation which
addresses usage of the Rights-of-Way, the conflicting terms in Section 3
and/or Section 8.5.3 of this Franchise shall be superseded by such City
ordinance or regulation; except that the Grantee shall not, through
application of such City ordinance or regulation of Rights-of-Way, be
subject to additional burdens with respect to usage of Public Rights-of-Way
that exceed burdens on similarly situated Right-of-Way users. Section 4 of
this Franchise shall not be superceded by any allegedly conflicting provision
of a City ordinance or regulation.
2.5.4 In the event any lawfully applicable City ordinance or regulation which
addresses usage of the Rights-of-Way adds to, modifies, amends, or
otherwise differently addresses issues addressed in Section 3 and/or Section
8.5.3 of this Franchise, the Grantee shall comply with such ordinance or
regulation of general applicability, regardless of which requirement was first
adopted; except that the Grantee shall not, through application of such City
ordinance or regulation of Rights-of-Way, be subject to additional burdens
with respect to usage of Rights-of-Way that exceed burdens on similarly situated
Rights-of-Way users. Section 4 of this Franchise shall not be superceded by
any allegedly conflicting provision of a City ordinance or regulation.
2.5.5 In the event the Grantee cannot determine how to comply with any Right-of-Way
requirement of the City, whether pursuant to this Franchise or other requirement,
the Grantee shall immediately provide written notice of such question, including
the Grantee’s proposed interpretation, to the City. The City shall provide a written
response within ten (10) business days of receipt indicating how the requirements
cited by the Grantee apply. The Grantee may proceed in accordance with its
proposed interpretation in the event a written response is not received within
thirteen (13) business days of mailing or delivering such written question.
2.6 Rules of Grantee.
The Grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and
conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
said Grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Franchise and
applicable law, and to assure uninterrupted service to each and all of its Subscribers;

3.3.9 In the event the System creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health,
safety or property, as reasonably determined by the City, the City, after providing
notice to the Grantee, if it is reasonably feasible to do so, may remove or relocate any
or all parts of the System at no expense to the City, other than the City's costs to act
on such determination.
3.4 Use of Existing Poles and Undergrounding of Cable.
3.4.1 Where existing poles, underground conduits, ducts or wire holding structures are
available for use by the Grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the
City may require, through the established permit, or any other applicable procedure,
the Grantee to use such existing poles and wireholding structures if the City determines
that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms available to the
Grantee for the use of such poles and structures are just and reasonable.
3.4.2 The Grantee agrees to place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground,
in the manner as may be required by the provisions of the City Code and City
policies, procedures, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, where all
utility facilities are placed underground. The Grantee shall not place facilities,
90

equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any existing gas, electric,
telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities or with any existing installations of
the City, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various existing utilities serving
the residents of the City. To the extent consistent with the City Code, City
policies, procedures, rules and regulations, System cable and facilities may be
constructed overhead where poles exist and electric or telephone lines or both are
now overhead. However, in no case may the Grantee install poles in areas of the
City where underground facilities are generally used by the utilities already
operating. If the City, at a future date, requires all electric and telephone lines to
be placed underground in all or part of the City, the Grantee shall, within a
reasonable time, similarly move its cables and lines, at no expense to the City, and
shall not seek damages from the City for such compliance.
3.5 Installation of Facilities.
3.5.1 No poles, towers, conduits, amplifier boxes, pedestal mounted terminal boxes,
similar structures, or other wire-holding structures shall be erected or installed by the
Grantee without obtaining any required permit or other authorization from the City.
3.5.2 No placement of any pole or wire holding structure of the Grantee is to be
considered a vested fee interest in the Rights-of-Way or in City property.
Whenever feasible, all transmission and distribution structures, lines, wires,
cables, equipment and poles or other fixtures erected by the Grantee within the City
are to be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights
and convenience of property owners.
3.6 Safety Requirements.
3.6.1 All applicable safety practices required by law shall be used during Grantee’s
construction, maintenance and repair of the System. The Grantee agrees, at all
times, to employ ordinary and reasonable care and to install and maintain in use
commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that
are likely to cause damage or injuries to the public or to property. All structures
and all lines, equipment and connections in the Rights-of-Way shall at all times be
kept and maintained in a safe condition, consistent with applicable safety codes.
3.6.2 The Grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of the System shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere with City communications
technologies related to the health, safety and welfare of City residents.
3.6.3 The Grantee shall install and maintain such devices as will apprise or warn
Persons using the Rights-of-Way of the existence of work being performed on the
System in Rights-of-Way.
3.6.4 The Grantee, or its Affiliate, shall be a member of the One Call Notification System
(otherwise known as "Gopher State One Call") or its successor, and shall field mark
the locations of its underground facilities upon request. Throughout the term of this
91
Error! Unknown document property name.
Franchise, the Grantee shall identify the location of its facilities for the City at no
charge to the City.
3.7 Removal of Facilities at Expiration of Franchise.
At the expiration of the term for which this Franchise is granted, or upon the expiration of any
renewal or extension period which may be granted, the City shall have the right to require
the Grantee, at the Grantee's sole expense: (i) to remove all portions of the System System
used exclusively for the provision of Cable Service from all Rights-of-Way within the City;
and (ii) to restore affected sites to their original condition. Should the Grantee fail, refuse or
neglect to comply with the City's directive, any portions of the System used exclusively for
the provision of Cable Service may at the option of the City become the sole property of the
City, at no expense to the City, or be removed, altered or relocated by the City at the cost of
the Grantee. The City shall not be liable to the Grantee for damages resulting from such
removal, alteration or relocation.

4.2 [Intentionally deleted.]
4.3 System Construction Timetable.
4.3.1 Reasonable Build-Out of the Entire City. The Parties recognize that Grantee,
or its affiliate QC, has constructed a legacy communications system throughout
the City that is capable of providing voice grade service. The Parties further
recognize that Grantee or its affiliate QC must upgrade its existing legacy
communications system and construct new facilities to make it capable of
providing Cable Service. The Parties agree that the following is a reasonable
build-out schedule taking into consideration Grantee’s desire for a standard based
on market success and the requirements of Minnesota state law.
(i) Complete Equitable Build-Out. Grantee aspires to provide Cable Service
to all households in the City within five (5) years of the Effective Date. In
addition, Grantee commits that a significant portion of its investment will
be targeted to areas below the median income in the City.
(ii) Initial Minimum Build-Out Commitment. Grantee agrees to be capable of
serving a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the City’s households with
Cable Service during the first two (2) years of the initial Franchise term,
provided, however that Grantee will make its best efforts to complete such
deployment within a shorter period of time; Grantee shall make available
and offer Cable Service to all Qualified Living Units identified in the
reports and maps, as required below showing the number of Qualified
Living Units in the City as of the Effective Date. The parties
acknowledge and agree that Qualified Living Units identified as of the
Effective Date may materially exceed fifteen percent (15%) of City’s
households. This initial minimum build-out commitment shall include
deployment equitably throughout the City and to a significant number of
households below the medium income in the City. Nothing in this
Franchise shall restrict Grantee from serving additional households in the
City with Cable Service.
(iii) Additional Build-Out Based on Market Success. If, at any quarterly
meeting, as required below, Grantee is actually serving twenty seven and
one-half percent (27.5%) of the Qualified Living Units, then Grantee
agrees the minimum build-out commitment shall increase to include an
additional fifteen (15%) of the total households in the City, which Grantee
agrees to serve within two (2) years from the quarterly meeting; provided,
however, the Grantee shall make its best efforts to complete such
deployment within a shorter period of time. For example, if, at a quarterly
meeting with the Commission’s Executive Director, Grantee shows that
sixty percent (60%) of the households in the City are Qualified Living
Units and Grantee is actually serving thirty percent (30%) of those
households with Cable Service, then Grantee shall serve an additional
fifteen percent (15%) of the total households in the City no later than 2
years after that quarterly meeting (a total of seventy-five (75%) of the total
95
Error! Unknown document property name.
households). This additional build-out based on market success shall
continue until every household in the City is served.
(iv) Quarterly Meetings. Commencing the first calendar quarter after the
Effective Date, and continuing throughout the term of this Franchise,
Grantee shall, unless otherwise directed by the Commission, meet
quarterly with the Executive Director of the Commission. At each
quarterly meeting, Grantee shall present information acceptable to the
City/Commission showing the number of Qualified Living Units Grantee
presently capable of receiving Cable Service and the number of Qualified
Living Units that Grantee is actually serving with Cable Service. Grantee
shall also present information acceptable to the City/Commission that
Grantee is equitably serving all portions of the City in compliance with
this subsection 4.3.1. In order to permit the City/Commission to monitor
and enforce the provisions of this section and other provisions of this
Franchise, the Grantee shall promptly, upon reasonable demand, show to
the City/Commission (to the City/Commission’s reasonable satisfaction)
maps and provide other documentation showing exactly where within the
City the Grantee is currently providing Cable Service.
(v) Specifically, the Grantee shall present reports and maps showing the
Commission the following information:
a. The total number of Living Units throughout the City;
b. The total number of Qualified Living Units throughout the City
both as of the Effective Date and the then-current calendar quarter;
c. The total number of Qualified Living Units, in the City,
subscribing to the Cable Service provided by the Grantee;
d. Locations of all Qualified Living Units throughout the City.
4.3.2 All construction shall be performed in accordance with applicable laws
and regulations, except where specifically waived by the City.
4.3.3 The Grantee shall make best efforts to provide the City with notice prior to its
commencement of steps of the System construction in which possible service
disruptions or physical construction activities may occur.
4.3.4 No System Node shall be activated until it is tested, and the Grantee
determines that all applicable technical standards have been met or exceeded.
4.4 Periodic Progress Report.
4.4.1 Public Notification. The Grantee shall establish and maintain some

reasonable means by which to inform the public and its Subscribers about:
Cable Service availability.
4.5 Line Extension Requirements.
4.5.1 Subject to subsection 4.3 above, the Grantee shall make Cable Service available
to all Qualified Living Units within the City, including multiple dwelling unit
buildings except for multiple dwelling unit buildings to which the Grantee,
after best efforts, has not obtained authorization to access.
Grantee shall have a line extension obligation a reasonable time after the first date
by which Grantee is providing Cable Service to more than fifty percent (50%) of
all subscribers receiving facilities based Cable Service from both the Grantee and
any other provider(s) of Cable Service within the City based on such Subscriber
count information as City may possess, including information available to the
City on a trade-secret or non-public basis. At that time, the City, in its reasonable
discretion and after meeting with Grantee, shall discuss the timeframe to complete
deployment to the remaining households in the City subject to a Line Extension
requirement that is the same or similar to the requirement of the incumbent
franchised cable operator.
4.5.2 Within the City's boundaries, including any areas annexed after the Effective
Date of this Franchise, the Grantee must provide Service to a Qualified Living
Unit upon request.
4.6 System Maintenance.
4.6.1 The Grantee shall interrupt Service only for good cause and for the shortest time
possible. Such interruption shall occur during periods of minimum use of the
System. The Grantee shall use its best efforts to provide the City with at least
twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice of a planned service interruption, except for a
planned service interruption which will have a minimal impact on Subscribers,
usually meaning affecting less than one hundred (100) Subscribers or less than a
fifteen (15) minute interruption.
4.6.2 Maintenance of the System shall be performed in accordance with the applicable
technical performance and operating standards established by FCC rules and
regulations. Should the FCC choose to abandon this field and does not preempt the
City's entry into this field, the City may adopt such technical performance and
operating standards as its own, and the Grantee shall comply with them at all times.

require special testing of a location or locations within the System if there is a
particular matter of controversy or unresolved complaints regarding System
construction, operations or installation work pertaining to such location(s). Such
tests shall be limited to the particular matter in controversy. The City shall
endeavor to so arrange its request for such special testing so as to minimize
hardship or inconvenience to the Grantee or to the Subscribers of such testing.
4.7.3 Before ordering such tests, the Grantee shall be afforded thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice to investigate and, if necessary, correct
problems or complaints upon which tests were ordered. The City shall meet with the
Grantee prior to requiring special tests to discuss the need for such and, if possible,
visually inspect those locations which are the focus of concern. If, after such
meetings and inspections, the City wishes to commence special tests and the thirty
(30) days have elapsed without correction of the matter in controversy or resolution
of complaints, the tests shall be conducted at the Grantee's expense by a qualified
engineer selected by the City and the Grantee, and Grantee shall cooperate in such
testing.

Grantee's chief technical authority, or designee, who shall certify all records of
tests provided to the City.
4.7.5 The Grantee shall provide the City with at least two (2) business days' prior
written notice of, and opportunity to observe, any tests performed on the System.
4.7.6 Test results shall be filed with the City within fourteen (14) days of a written
request by the City.
4.7.7 If any test indicates that any part or component of the System fails to meet
applicable requirements, the Grantee, without requirement of additional notice or
request from the City, shall take corrective action, retest the locations and advise
the City of the action taken and the results achieved by filing a written report
certified by the Grantee's chief technical authority.

conditions and procedures contained in this Franchise and in applicable law or
regulations.

SECTION 6.
ACCESS CHANNEL(S) PROVISIONS
6.1. Public, Educational and Government Access.
6.1.1 The City or its designee shall operate, administer, promote, and manage PEG access
programming on the Cable System.
6.1.2 Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the Effective Date, the Grantee shall
dedicate and make available seven (7) video channels for public, educational,
governmental and religious use; provided, however, that the Grantee shall not be
required to provide more, nor shall provide fewer, such channels than the
incumbent franchise. Use of the seven (7) PEG Access Channels shall be
determined by the Commission. The Commission shall have the right to rename,
reprogram or otherwise change the use of these channels at any time, in its sole
discretion, provided such use is Noncommercial and public, educational,
governmental or religious in nature. Nothing herein shall diminish any rights
of the Commission to secure additional PEG channels pursuant to Minn. Stat.
§ 238.084, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.
6.1.3 Upon designating the location (i.e. channel number) of the PEG channels, the
channels shall not be relocated without the consent of the Commission. Grantee
shall make reasonable efforts to minimize relocations of the PEG channels.
Grantee must request any channel relocation at least three (3) months prior to
seeking to implement the channel relocation. Grantee shall reimburse the City, the
Commission and/or PEG entity for any reasonable costs incurred for: (i)
purchasing or modifying equipment, business cards, and signage; (ii) any marketing
and notice of the channel change that the Commission, the City and/or PEG entity
reasonably determines is necessary; (iii) logo changes; and (iv) promoting,
marketing and advertising the channel location of the affected PEG channel(s)
during the twelve-month period preceding the effective date of the channel change.
Alternatively, the Grantee may choose to supply necessary equipment itself,
provided such equipment is satisfactory to the City, the Commission or PEG entity.
6.1.4 Grantee shall make all PEG channels available in standard definition (SD),
digital format, and in high definition (HD) provided that the signal received from
the Commission, City or PEG entity by the Grantee is in HD, and provided that
the Grantee shall not be required to provide the PEG channels at a resolution
higher than the highest resolution used in connection with the Grantee’s delivery
of other channels. Grantee may implement HD carriage of the PEG channels in
any manner (including selection of compression, utilization of IP, amount of
system capacity or bandwidth, and other processing characteristics) that produces
a signal as accessible, functional, useable and of a quality comparable (meaning
indistinguishable to the viewer) to broadcast HD channels carried on the cable
system. The Commission acknowledges that HD programming may require the
viewer to have special viewer equipment (such as an HDTV and an HD-capable
digital device/receiver), but any subscriber who can view an HD signal delivered
via the cable system at a receiver shall also be able to view the HD PEG channel
at that receiver, without additional charges or equipment.
104
Error! Unknown document property name.
All of the Access Channels will be made available through a multi-channel
display (i.e. a picture in picture feed) on a single TV screen called a “mosaic” (the
“Quad Cities Mosaic”), where a cable subscriber can access via an interactive
video menu one of any of the seven (7) Access Channels. The Quad Cities
Mosaic will be located on Channel 40. The seven (7) Access Channels will be
located at Channels 8440-8445 and 8049 (SD), and 8940-8945 and 8549 (HD).
The Quad Cities Mosaic will contain only Access Channels authorized by the
Commission, provided that the Commission may add to its Mosaic channels
originated by other franchising authorities with consent of such originator if
programming on such channel(s) is of public interest within the Quad Cities
Franchise Area. Grantee shall not include any other programming or Channels on
the Quad Cities Mosaic, or any Quad Cities originated programming on another
PEG producer’s Mosiac, without the Commission’s written consent.
6.1.5 As the Grantee innovates and improves the functionality and interactivity and/or
adds capability for personalization of the Mosaics, the Grantee will provide the
same nagivational, interactive and personalization features for the Quad Cities
Mosaic Channel as are available to Subscribers for every other commercial
Mosaic Channel. (For example, if a Subscriber has the capability to add selected
sports or news Channels to the Sports or News Mosaics, then that Subscriber shall
also be able to add a PEG Channel to any of the Mosaics.
If through technology changes or innovation in the future, the Grantee
discontinues the use of Mosaic presentations for other Channels including
broadcast channels and commercial cable/satellite Channels (such as the News
Mosiac, the Sports Mosaic, and/or the Children’s Mosaic), then Grantee will
either continue to support the Quad Cities Mosaic Channel as determined in the
Commission’s sole discretion or reach mutual agreement with the Commission
regarding how to accommodate the Quad Cities Mosaic Channel to ensure PEG
Channels are treated no less favorably than commercial channels provided by
Grantee.
6.1.6 Grantee will make its electronic programming guide vendor (“EPG provider”)
available giving the Commission or City the ability to place PEG channel
programming information on the Grantee’s interactive channel guide. Grantee
will be responsible for providing the designations and instructions necessary to
ensure the channels will appear on the programming guide and for any System
costs associated therewith. The Commission shall be responsible for providing
programming information to the EPG provider and for any costs the EPG
provider charges to programmers who utilize its service.
6.1.7 In the event the Grantee makes any change in the System or related equipment and
facilities or in signal delivery technology, which change directly or indirectly
causes the signal quality or transmission of PEG channel programming or PEG
services to fall below technical standards under applicable law, the Grantee shall,
at its own expense, provide any necessary technical assistance, transmission
equipment, and training of PEG personnel, and in addition, provide necessary
assistance so that PEG facilities may be used as intended, including, among other
things, so that live and taped programming can be cablecasted efficiently to
105

Subscribers. Grantee shall carry all components of the PEG Channels offered by
the City and Commission including closed captioning, multichannel sound, DVR
capability, etc.
6.1.8 All PEG channels shall be carried on the Basic Service tier.
6.2 PEG Support Obligations.
6.2.1 In addition to the franchise fee required under this Franchise, the Grantee shall
collect from Subscribers via an itemization on customer bills (“PEG Fee”) and pay
quarterly to the Commission an amount equal to three percent (3%) of its Gross
RevenuesPayment of the PEG Fee shall be made to the Commission within thirty
(30) days of the end of each of the Grantee's fiscal quarters together with a
report showing the basis for the computation. The Commission shall have the
right to require further supporting information for each payment. All amounts
paid under this paragraph shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the
Commission in accordance with the rights provided to the City pursuant to Section
8.3 of this Franchise. In the event the PEG Fee amount or structure paid by the
incumbent cable provider to the City or Commission is modified during the term of
this Franchise, then the City shall so notify the Grantee of any such change and the
parties will meet to determine if the Grantee’s PEG Fee structure should be modified
to ensure that Grantee’s PEG Fee payment obligations hereunder do not exceed
those of the incumbent cable provider.
6.2.2 The Grantee and the City agree comply with any federal or State statutory change
that entirely eliminates the Grantee's obligation to pay a franchise fee.
6.2.3 The Grantee acknowledges that the franchise held by the incumbent
franchised cable provider within the Franchise Area includes obligations for
an Institutional Network for the benefit of the City and other institutions and to
facilitate PEG uses of the I-Net. The parties acknowledge that the public
interest would not be served by duplicating existing I-Net facilities or services
provided under other franchises. Grantee agrees that if any other cable
operator franchised within the Franchise Area provides additional I-Net
facilities or services which results in additional costs incurred by such other
franchised cable operator, the Grantee shall meet with the Commission upon
request of the Commission to determine a fair and equitable contribution of INet
facilities by the Grantee to proportionately match said I-Net obligations. If
the City and Grantee are not able to reach mutual agreement to resolve this
issue, the Grantee and the City agree to enter into a binding mediation to
determine a fair and equitable contribution by the Grantee to proportionately
match (on a per month, per subscriber basis) said I-Net obligations.
6.3 Regional Channel 6.
The Grantee shall designate standard VHF Channel 6 for uniform regional channel usage to
the extent required by State law.
106

6.4 Leased Access Channels.
The Grantee shall provide Leased Access Channels as required by federal and State law.
6.5 Universal Service Tier.
The Grantee shall not have a Universal PEG Tier obligation until the first date by
which Grantee is providing Cable Service to more than fifty percent (50%) of all
subscribers receiving facilities based Cable Service from both the Grantee and any
other provider(s) of Cable Service within the City. At that time, the City, in its
reasonable discretion and after meeting with Grantee, shall determine the
timeframe required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.5.
6.6 Costs and Payments not Franchise Fees.
The parties agree that any costs to the Grantee associated with the provision of
support for PEG access pursuant too Section 6 of this Franchise does not constitute
and is not part of a franchise fee and falls within one or more of the exceptions to 47
U.S.C. § 542.
SECTION 7.

7.1 PEG Programming Connectivity.
Grantee acknowledges that the City has acquired Institutional Network (I-Net) capacity,
facilities, interconnection, services and resources from the incumbent franchised cable
provider to, among other things, facilitate institutions’ deliver of PEG programming to
the Commission’s master control facility. The I-Net capacity the City has acquired
includes dedicated fiber capacity, facilities, interconnection, services and resources.
Grantee shall provide additional connectivity for such PEG access programming purposes
as provided herein, provided that the parties acknowledge that the public interest would
not be served by duplicating existing I-Net facilities or services already provided under
the incumbent’s franchise. To the extent required for delivery of PEG programming due
to elimination of I-Net capacity provided by the incumbent provider, Grantee shall
provide and maintain, free of charge and without fees or costs imposed, a direct fiber

Living Unit that is not receiving similar service from another provider, unless weather
or other conditions beyond the control of the Grantee require more time.
7.2.4 Grantee agrees that if any broadband service is required in order to receive the
Complimentary Service obligations set forth, Grantee will provide such broadband

Letter of Credit for the whole amount thereof and use the proceeds as the City
determines in its sole discretion. The failure to replace or replenish any Letter of

unless the term thereof sooner expires or unless continuation of the Franchise
would endanger the health, safety and welfare of any Person or the public.
10.3. Abandonment of Service.

first given three (3) months written notice to the City. The Grantee may not

10.4. Removal After Abandonment, Termination or Forfeiture.
10.4.1 In the event of termination or forfeiture of the Franchise or abandonment of the

City's demand for removal is given, the City shall have the right to apply funds
secured by the Letter of Credit and Performance Bond toward removal and/or
declare all right, title, and interest to the System to be in the City with all
rights of ownership including, but not limited to, the right to operate the
System or transfer the System to another for operation by it.

controlling interest in Grantee, the sale of a controlling interest in the
Grantee's assets, a merger including the merger of a subsidiary and parent
entity, consolidation, or the creation of a subsidiary or affiliate entity, shall
take place until a written request has been filed with the City requesting
approval of the sale, transfer, or corporate change and such approval has been
granted or deemed granted, provided, however, that said approval shall not
be required where Grantee grants a security interest in its Franchise and/or
assets to secure an indebtedness. Upon notice to the City, Grantee may undertake
legal changes necessary to consolidate the corporate or partnership structures of
its System provided there is no change in the controlling interests which could
materially alter the financial responsibilities for the Grantee and provided Grantee
must seek approval of any transaction constituting a “fundamental corporate
change” under state law.

Grantee's parent corporation or any other entity having a controlling interest
in Grantee, so as to create a new controlling interest therein, shall be

interest" as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes
actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In any event, as used
herein, a new "controlling interest" shall be deemed to be created upon the acquisition
through any transaction or related group of transactions of a legal or beneficial
interest of fifteen percent (15%) or more by one Person. Acquisition by one
Person of an interest of five percent (5%) or more in a single transaction shall
require notice to the City.

required to be filed by applicable law, the following:
10.5.3.1 All contracts, agreements or other documents that constitute the

(“MnDOT”). Upon request, Grantee shall provide City with a
complete copy of any such document; and
10.5.3.3 Any other documents or information related to the transaction as
may be specifically requested by the City.
10.5.4 The City shall have such time as is permitted by federal law in which to review a
transfer request.
10.5.5 Grantee shall reimburse City for all the reasonable legal, administrative,
consulting costs and fees associated with the City's review of any request to
transfer. Nothing herein shall prevent Grantee from negotiating partial or
complete payment of such costs and fees by the transferee. Grantee may not
itemize any such reimbursement on Subscriber bills, but may recover such
expenses in its Subscriber rates.
10.5.6 In no event shall a sale, transfer, corporate change, or assignment of ownership or

pursuant to subsection 10.5.1 or 10.5.2, the City shall have the right to purchase the
System for the value of the consideration proposed in such transaction. The City's
right to purchase shall arise upon City's receipt of notice of the material terms of an
offer or proposal for sale, transfer, corporate change, or assignment, which Grantee
has accepted. Notice of such offer or proposal must be conveyed to City in writing
and separate from any general announcement of the transaction.
10.5.8 The City shall be deemed to have waived its right to purchase the System
pursuant to this Section only in the following circumstances:
10.5.8.1 If City does not indicate to Grantee in writing, within sixty (60)
days of receipt of written notice of a proposed sale, transfer,
corporate change, or assignment as contemplated in Section 10.5.7
above, its intention to exercise its right of purchase; or
10.5.8.2 It approves the assignment or sale of the Franchise as provided
within this Section.
10.5.9 No Franchise may be transferred if the City determines the Grantee is in
noncompliance of the Franchise unless an acceptable compliance program has been
approved by City. The approval of any transfer of ownership pursuant to this
Section shall not be deemed to waive any rights of City to subsequently enforce
noncompliance issues relating to this Franchise.
10.5.10 Any transfer or sale of the Franchise without the prior written consent of the City
shall be considered to impair the City's assurance of due performance. The granting of
approval for a transfer or sale in one instance shall not render unnecessary
approval of any subsequent transfer or sale for which approval would otherwise be
required.

subject of that information, unless Grantee has received specific written
authorization from the Subscriber to make such data available. Such written
permission shall be for a limited period of time not to exceed one (1) year which
may be renewed at the option of the Subscriber. No penalty shall be
invoked for a Subscriber's failure to provide or renew such
authorization. The authorization shall be revocable at any time by the
Subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever.
11.2.3 Written permission from the Subscriber shall not be required for the
conducting of System-wide or individually addressed electronic sweeps for the

given by this Franchise or otherwise existing or given may be exercised from time to
time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by City and the

THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT is made this ____ day of
___________________, 2016, by and between Qwest Broadband Services, Inc., a
Delaware Corporation, party of the first part, hereinafter called “CenturyLink,” and the
Quad Cities Cable Communications Commission, a Minnesota municipal joint powers
commission, hereinafter called “Commission,” and the City of Andover, hereinafter
called “Member City,” together party of the second part.
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Commission has recommended that the Member City award to Qwest
Broadband Services, Inc. a franchise for the operation of a cable communications system
in the Member City; and
WHEREAS, the Commission has recommended and the Member City has required, as a
condition of its award of a cable communications franchise, that the Commission and
Member City be indemnified with respect to all claims and actions arising from the award
of said franchise.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing promises and the mutual
promises contained in this agreement and in consideration of entering into a cable
television franchise agreement and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, CenturyLink hereby agrees, at its sole cost and expense,
to fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Commission and the Member City, their
officers, boards, commissions, employees and agents against any and all claims, suits,
actions, liabilities and judgments for damages, cost or expense (including, but not limited
to, court and appeal costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements assumed or
incurred by the Commission and the Member City in connection therewith) arising out of
the actions of the Commission and the Member City in granting a franchise to
CenturyLink. This includes any claims by another franchised cable operator against the
City that the terms and conditions of the CenturyLink franchise are less burdensome than
another franchise granted by the Commission or that the CenturyLink Franchise does not
satisfy the requirements of applicable federal, state, or local law(s). The indemnification
provided for herein shall not extend or apply to any acts of the Commission constituting a
violation or breach by the Commission of the contractual provisions of the franchise
ordinance, unless such acts are the result of a change in Applicable Law, the order of a
court or administrative agency, or are caused by the acts of CenturyLink.
The Commission shall give CenturyLink reasonable notice of the making of any claim or
the commencement of any action, suit or other proceeding covered by this agreement.
The Commission shall cooperate with CenturyLink in the defense of any such action, suit
or other proceeding at the request of CenturyLink. The Commission and Member City
may participate in the defense of a claim, but if CenturyLink provides a defense at
CenturyLink’s expense then CenturyLink shall not be liable for any attorneys' fees,
expenses or other costs that the Commission and the Member City may incur if it chooses
to participate in the defense of a claim, unless and until separate representation is

pay, from the date such separate representation is required forward, all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Commission and the Member City in defending itself with
regard to any action, suit or proceeding indemnified by CenturyLink. Provided, however,
that in the event that such separate representation is or becomes necessary, and the
Commission or the Member City desires to hire a counselor any other outside experts or

agreement shall not be dependent or conditioned upon the validity of the cable
communications franchise ordinance or the validity of any of the procedures or

ordinance or the grant of the franchise is declared null and void in a legal or
administrative proceeding.
It is the purpose of this agreement to provide maximum indemnification to the
Commission and the Member City under the terms set out herein and, in the event of a

greatest extent permitted by law, to provide for the indemnification of the Commission
and the Member City by CenturyLink. This agreement shall be a binding obligation of
