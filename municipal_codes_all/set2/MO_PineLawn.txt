An employee absent because of sickness shall inform his/her immediate supervisor on the
first (1st) day of absence and daily thereafter if required by the immediate supervisor and
failure to do so may be the cause for denial of sick leave with pay for the period of absence.
To receive sick leave with pay, the employee may be required by his/her immediate
supervisor to produce evidence in the form of a personal affidavit, or a medical certificate from
the attending physician or from a physician designated by the Mayor, substantiating the need
for absence from work due to illness or injury. Failure to furnish such evidence requested by
the immediate supervisor shall be sufficient reason for denying sick leave with pay.
Leave Of Absence. Sick leave shall not be allowed in advance of being earned. If an employee
has insufficient sick leave accumulation to cover a period of absence, no allowance for sick leave
shall be granted in advance or in anticipation of future sick leave credits. In such cases, a payroll
deduction for the time lost shall be made for the period during which the absence accrued,
provided however, that earned vacation leave may be used for this purpose if the employee so
elects and if approved by the Mayor. If all accrued sick leave and vacation is used, the employee
may be granted a leave of absence without pay or termination.
Miscellaneous.
The minimum charge against sick leave shall be one-half (½) day. An employee who works
two (2) or more hours during any half (½) day's employment shall not be charged with sick
leave for that half (½) day, providing his/her supervisor determines his/her absence from work
for the balance of the half (½) day is because of illness or disability.
No employee shall be reimbursed for sick leave outstanding at the time of resignation or other
termination of his/her City employment.
Approved sick leave shall not constitute a break in continuous employment in computing
seniority.
Retroactively. In determining the accumulated sick leave of employees at the time of the adoption
of this Section, prior full credit not exceeding a maximum of thirteen (13) weeks shall be given for
unused sick leave accumulated in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
Section 125.100. Vacations.

Life Insurance Company in such amounts as may be appropriate to provide plan benefits.

contracts will not currently be considered as income paid to the employees concerned. Thus, the

Pine Lawn but shall be held as a general, unpledged and unrestricted asset.

Except as set forth in Subsection (D) of Section 130.040, no meeting or vote may be closed
without an affirmative public vote of the majority of a quorum of the public governmental body. The
vote of each member of the governmental body on the question of closing a public meeting or vote
and the specific reason for closing that public meeting or vote by reference to a specific Section of
this Chapter shall be announced publicly at an open meeting of the governmental body and
entered into the minutes.
Any meeting or vote closed pursuant to Section 130.020 shall be closed only to the extent
necessary for the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote. Public
governmental bodies shall not discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or vote. Public
governmental bodies holding a closed meeting shall close only an existing portion of the meeting
facility necessary to house the members of the public governmental body in the closed session,
allowing members of the public to remain to attend any subsequent open session held by the
public governmental body following the closed session.
Section 130.060. Journals of Meetings and Records of Voting.
Except as provided in Section 130.020, rules authorized pursuant to Article III of the Missouri
Constitution and as otherwise provided by law, all votes shall be recorded, and if a roll call is
taken, as to attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not voting, to the name of the
individual member of the public governmental body. Any votes taken during a closed meeting shall
be taken by roll call. All public meetings shall be open to the public and public votes and public
records shall be open to the public for inspection and duplication. All votes taken by roll call in
meetings of a public governmental body consisting of members who are all elected, shall be cast

meeting. When it is necessary to take votes by roll call in a meeting of the public governmental
body, due to an emergency of the public body, with a quorum of the members of the public body
physically present and in attendance and less than a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet, or any other voice or electronic
means, the nature of the emergency of the public body justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such emergency exists, the votes taken shall
be regarded as if all members were physically present and in attendance at the meeting.
A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and retained by the public
governmental body including, but not limited to, a record of any vote taken at such meeting. The
minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent, and a record of
votes taken. When a roll call vote is taken, the minutes shall attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote,
or abstinence if not voting, to the name of the individual member of the public governmental body.
Section 130.070. Accessibility of Meetings.
Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the public and of sufficient size to
accommodate the anticipated attendance by members of the public and at a time reasonably
convenient to the public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or impractical.
Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special access to the meeting to handicapped or
disabled individuals.
When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or at a place
that is not reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the
public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall
be stated in the minutes.
Section 130.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
Section 130.090. Custodian Designated — Response to Request
for Access to Records.
The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible for maintenance and
control of all records. The custodian may designate deputy custodians in operating departments of
the City and such other departments or offices as the custodian may determine. Deputy
custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and meetings in accord with the
policies enumerated herein.
Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the request is received
by the custodian of records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain
format, the public body shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is
available. If access to the public record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a
detailed explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that

the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which
access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third (3rd)
business day following the date that the request for the statement is received.
Section 130.100. Violations — Remedies, Procedure, Penalty —
Validity of Actions by Governing Bodies in Violation —
Governmental Bodies May Seek Interpretation of Law.
The remedies provided by this Section against public governmental bodies shall be in addition to
those provided by any other provision of law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to, or citizen of, this
State, may seek judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the
County in which the public governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of
a summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil action brought to enforce the
provisions of Sections 610.010 to 610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the
subject matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or otherwise dispose of
the public record sought to be inspected and examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an
exemption pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record is not a
public record until the court directs otherwise.
Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., demonstrates
to the court that the body in question is subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., and has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion shall be
on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds that there is a knowing violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all costs
and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing a violation. The court shall
determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds that there was a purposeful violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing such a violation. The
court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction,
the seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body has violated
any provision of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in
violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts of the particular
case that the public interest in the enforcement of the policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., outweighs the public interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed

meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within one (1) year from which the
violation is ascertainable and in no event shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the
violation. This Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of bonds or
other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body if a public hearing, election or
public sale has been held regarding the bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of closing a particular meeting,
record or vote may bring suit at the expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court
of the County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to ascertain the
propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of the attorney general or an attorney for the
governmental body.
Section 130.110. Fees for Copying Public Records — Limitations.
[Ord. No. 2011-30 §1, 8-8-2011]
Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body shall provide access to and,
upon request, furnish copies of public records subject to the following:
Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,
RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the average hourly
rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time required for
fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the
scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies using employees
of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the records
may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14) inches shall
include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of
pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and programming, if
necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for the duplication. Fees for
maps, blueprints, or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual
rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps, blueprints, or
plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the actual cost of such
programming.
The City shall charge a fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) for copies of Police-generated
reports.
[Ord. No. 2013-018 §1, 6-28-2013]
Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of copies.

[Ord. No. 732 §1(11-17), 9-13-1993]
Whenever any contemplated purchase or contract for services is reasonably anticipated to cost
more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), the City Administrator shall cause to be published in
one (1) issue of two (2) newspapers of general circulation in the St. Louis metropolitan area a
notice inviting sealed bids; said notice shall be published at least ten (10) days prior to the date set
for receipt of bids. The notice herein required shall include a general description of the articles to
be purchased or the services to be performed and the time and place for opening of sealed bids.
In addition, the notice shall be sent via certified mail to at least five (5) responsible prospective
suppliers of the item to be purchased or services to be performed, including all suppliers of such
items with whom the City has done business within the preceding two (2) years. If five (5)
responsible suppliers cannot be reasonably located, the department head shall certify that fact
upon presentation of the bids. Notice of the invitation to bid shall be posted in the City hall.
Sealed bids shall be received by the City Clerk and shall be identified as bids on the envelope.
The bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the invitation to bid and in any
public notice before at least two (2) witnesses. After the opening, the department head shall
tabulate all bids received and shall file a written report of the bids with the Board of Aldermen
before its next meeting together with his/her written recommendations as to whom the Board
should award the contract.
When deemed necessary or when directed by the Board of Aldermen, bid deposits shall be
prescribed in inviting bids. A successful bidder shall forfeit any surety required by the City upon
failure on the bidder's part to enter into a contract within ten (10) days after the award, and the
invitation to bid shall so state. An unsuccessful bidder shall be entitled to return of his/her surety.

time specified, without delay or interference.
The character, integrity, responsibility, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder.
Whether the bidder is in default on the payment of taxes, licenses or other monies due the
City, and this factor alone shall justify disqualification.
The quality and performance of previous contracts or services.
The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws, the provisions of this Code and
other City ordinances relating to the contract services.
The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or
provide the service.
The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular
use required.

Section 145.040. Exceptions to the Purchasing Policy.
[Ord. No. 732 §1(11-18), 9-13-1993]
Single-Source Purchases. In the event there is only one (1) acceptable vendor capable of
furnishing a particular service or commodity, the department head may be authorized to procure
such service or commodity without bidding. The department head shall document the particular
facts which make the item a single-source purchase, and the purchase shall be approved by the
Mayor.
Emergency Purchases. Where an emergency situation requires immediate purchase of supplies
or services and time is of the essence, the department head is authorized to procure the supplies
or services needed without following the bidding procedures. The department head shall maintain
a written record of the circumstances surrounding emergency purchases and the purchases shall
be approved by the Mayor.
Situations Calling For Competitive Negotiations. Where it can be demonstrated that the City
receives the best value on a purchase through informal discussion and bargaining rather than
through the conventional bidding process, the department head need not follow the conventional
bidding process exclusively. Such purchases shall be documented by the department head and
given prior approval by the Mayor. Examples would include, but not be limited to, circumstances
where time is a crucial factor, when the procurement involves high technology items, or when
there is obvious inherent economy in purchasing from a particular vendor.
Cooperative Purchasing. The purchasing procedures established shall not apply to purchases
made by, through or with the Division of Procurement of the State of Missouri, the Purchasing
Department of St. Louis County, or any other governmental agency or unit with whom the City is
permitted to engage in cooperative purchasing. A department supervisor has the authority to join
with any other governmental unit in cooperative purchasing when the best interests of the City
shall be served by such cooperative purchasing.
Confidential Expenditures. Confidential expenditures such as payments to informants, purchase of
materials as evidence (such as narcotics), or other uses as may be required by law enforcement
personnel working in an undercover capacity cannot be subject to normal purchasing procedures.
All such disbursements made shall be approved by the Chief of Police and the Mayor and shall be
documented by written vouchers showing date, amount, nature of expenditure, signature of
requesting officer or agent, and approval of the Chief of Police.
Professional Services And Real Estate. Specifically excluded from the provisions of the City's
purchasing policy are the procurement of real estate and professional services.

deprive the owner thereof, he/she purposefully fails to return leased or rented personal property to
the place and within the time specified in an agreement in writing providing for the leasing or
renting of such personal property. In addition, any person who has leased or rented personal
property of another, who conceals the property from the owner or who otherwise sells, pawns,
loans, abandons or gives away the leased or rented property is guilty of the offense of failing to
return leased or rented property. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all forms of leasing
and rental agreements including, but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options
to buy the leased or rented personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own
contracts. For the purpose of determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing
contracts which provide options to buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property
until such time as the owner endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to
the lessee.
It shall be prima facie evidence of the offense of failing to return leased or rented property when a
person who has leased or rented personal property of another willfully fails to return or make
arrangements acceptable with the lessor to return the personal property to its owner at the
owner's place of business within ten (10) days after proper notice following the expiration of the
lease or rental agreement, except that if the motor vehicle has not been returned within seventytwo
(72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement, such failure to return the
motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of failing to return leased or
rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the motor vehicle has
not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental
agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the lessee to
return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor vehicle
to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor vehicles. Any
Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor vehicle and notify
the lessor that he/she may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed and its vehicle
identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or rented property is
not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the ten (10) day period
prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the
property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five
(5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this
Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.
This Section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more
difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the
lessee shall notify the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the expiration
of the lease or rental agreement or within ten (10) days after proper notice.
Proper notice by the lessor shall consist of a written demand addressed and mailed by certified or
registered mail to the lessee at the address given at the time of making the lease or rental
agreement. The notice shall contain a statement that the failure to return the property may subject
the lessee to criminal prosecution.
Any person who has leased or rented personal property of another who destroys such property so
as to avoid returning it to the owner shall be guilty of property damage pursuant to Section
215.300 in addition to being in violation of this Section.
Venue shall lie in the County where the personal property was originally rented or leased.
Note — Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

Article XIII. Smoking Regulations Within City
Section 215.645. Smoking Limited to Certain Areas in the City of
Pine Lawn.
[Ord. No. 736 §§1 — 2, 10-11-1993]
Legislative Intent.
The Board of Aldermen hereby finds that the effects of smoke generated by the smoking of
cigarettes, cigars, pipes and similar articles pose a damage to the health, safety and wellbeing
of persons who do not smoke.
The Board of Aldermen further finds that the Surgeon General's report on smoking hazards
link high levels of involuntary smoke exposure to reduced breathing ability in passive smokers
and other health dangers and therefore further buttress the need to provide protection to nonsmokers
in public settings.
The Board of Aldermen further finds that the smoking of tobacco is a positive danger to health
and a cause of material annoyance, inconvenience and discomfort to those who are present
in confined places.
The Board of Aldermen further finds that the General Assembly of the State Missouri has
recently enacted the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1992, pursuant to which certain conduct of
smokers and of persons permitting, causing, suffering or allowing smoking in public places or
public meetings, as therein defined, is designated an infraction; and, therefore, the purpose of
this Section is to place reasonable limitations on smoking within certain areas in the City of
Pine Lawn, Missouri, while striking a reasonable balance between the health needs of all nonsmoking
individuals, the rights of smokers and the imposition of regulatory burdens on
businesses and to provide for the implementation and enforcement of the Clean Indoor Air
Act of 1992 within the City of Pine Lawn, Missouri.
Definitions. As used herein, the following terms shall mean:
BAR or TAVERN

located with particular consideration being given to the proximity of the property to residential
property, park, churches, schools and playgrounds;
Littering committed by owner, occupant or persons frequenting the alleged nuisance property;
Drinking of alcoholic beverages in public by the owner, occupant or persons frequenting the
alleged nuisance property;

vicinity of a premise by the owner, occupant or persons frequenting the alleged nuisance
property;
Sale or use of illegal drugs, as prohibited by Federal or State Statute or City ordinance, upon
or in the immediate vicinity of the alleged nuisance property by the owner, occupant or
persons frequenting the property;
Harassing or intimidating behavior exhibited by the owner, occupant or persons frequenting or
congregating about the alleged nuisance property toward persons living in the neighborhood
in which the property is located or toward persons passing by the property;

occupant or persons frequenting the alleged nuisance property;
Street or sidewalk congestion associated with or caused by the owner, occupant or persons
frequenting the alleged nuisance property;
Any other activity deemed relevant by the hearing officer to the determination of whether said
activity is detrimental to the neighborhood in which the alleged nuisance property is located.
Should the evidence support a finding that the building, structure or condition constitutes a public
safety nuisance, the hearing officer shall issue an order making specific findings of facts which
shows the building, structure or condition to be a public safety nuisance, identifying the party or
parties responsible for abating such nuisance and ordering the manner in which the nuisance is to
be abated.

vehicles which have been towed with the consent of the owner on a negotiated basis. Storage
charges may be assessed only for the time in which the towing company complies with the
procedural requirements of this Article.
The Board of Aldermen may from time to time establish maximum reasonable towing, storage and
other charges which can be imposed by towing and storage companies operating within the City,
and which are consistent with this Article and with Sections 304.155 to 304.158, RSMo. Any
violation of said established maximum charges shall be deemed a violation of this Section of the

A towing company may impose a charge of not more than one-half (½) of the regular towing
charge for the towing of abandoned property at the request of the owner of private real property or
that owner's agent pursuant to this Article if the owner of the abandoned property or the owner's
agent returns to the abandoned property before it is removed from the private real property. The
regular towing charge may only be imposed after the abandoned property has been removed from
the property and is in transit.
The fee for the City of Pine Lawn tow release shall increase from thirty-five dollars ($35.00) to fifty
dollars ($50.00), to cover the cost the City incurs in administering and processing issuance.

The City Traffic Engineer shall place and maintain traffic control signs, signals and devices when and
as required under the traffic ordinances of the City to make effective the provisions of said ordinances

regulate traffic under the traffic ordinances of the City or under State law or to guide or warn traffic.
Section 315.020. Manual and Specifications for Traffic Control
Devices.
All traffic control signs, signals and devices shall conform to the manual and specifications approved
by the State Highways and Transportation Commission or resolution adopted by the Board of
Aldermen of the City. All signs or signals required hereunder for a particular purpose shall so far as
practicable be uniform as to type and location throughout the City. All traffic control devices so erected
and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Title shall be official traffic control devices.
Section 315.030. Obedience to Traffic Control Devices.
The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official traffic control device applicable
thereto placed in accordance with the provisions of this Title, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or

yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and
Transportation Commission with reference to an intersection involving a State highway,
and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under
their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection
where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

roadways for the owner to permit his or her motor vehicle to be operated at a rate of speed
more than the posted speed limit. It shall be a rebuttable presumption that when a vehicle is
recorded by an automated traffic enforcement system, it was being operated with the consent
or the permission of the owner. Any such infraction may be excused upon submission of a

such an operator), and the theft was timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement
agency;
The license plate and/or tags depicted in the recorded image(s) were stolen and being

this shall not be a justification for the operator of the motor vehicle), and the theft was
timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency;
Ownership of the motor vehicle had in fact been transferred prior to the violation
(provided State records substantiate this statement);
Any other issues or evidence that the Court deems pertinent.
A violation hereunder is based on ownership, without regard to whether the owner was
operating the motor vehicle at the time of the infraction, except that, no liability shall be
imposed on the owner of a motor vehicle when the vehicle is being permissively used by a
lessee if the owner furnishes the name, address, and operator's license number of the person
renting or leasing the motor vehicle at the time the violation occurred to the City within twentyone
(21) days from the time of receipt of written request for such information.
Automated Traffic Enforcement System Authorized. An automated traffic enforcement system is

license plate and license number of the motor vehicle. Recorded images may also be used as
evidence of other violations to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Enforcement Procedures.
Except as otherwise provided herein, upon review of recorded image(s) showing an infraction
under this Section, a Police Officer of the City Police Department shall complete a notice in a
form approved by the Chief of Police (which form may be completed electronically), and the
City shall cause the completed notice to be mailed to the owner at the owner's last known
address by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, within thirty (30) days after the
date the recorded image(s) were taken.
Based upon the information obtained from the recorded image, the Police Officer may obtain
any additional information about the owner, which is necessary to complete or mail the notice,
from the records of the Missouri Department of Revenue or any other legal means; or, if the
motor vehicle is registered in another state or country, from the motor vehicle registration
records of the department or agency of the other state or country analogous to the Missouri
Department of Revenue or any other legal means.
If there is more than one owner of the motor vehicle, a notice may be completed and
addressed to any or all of them, and each such owner shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder.
The notice shall direct the owner to respond within the time prescribed in the notice either by
paying the fine specified in this Section at the appropriate time and place in the City or by
providing a sworn statement of applicability of one of the justifications for exceeding the
speed limit set forth in this Section.
A copy of the recorded image(s) upon which the notice is based shall be sent to the owner
with the notice.

The notice shall include a request that the name, address and operator's license number of
any person renting or leasing the motor vehicle at the time the violation occurred be furnished
to the City within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the request.
Any sworn statement provided by an owner shall be examined by the City Prosecuting
Attorney. If the City Prosecuting Attorney determines that a statement is insufficient, including
but not limited to a determination based upon a comparison of the statement to the recorded
image(s), then a letter shall be sent to the owner (any or all of them) at its last known address
by first class United States mail, postage prepaid by the City, indicating that the statement
was insufficient and the fine specified in this Section must be paid at the appropriate time and
place in the City within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the letter. If the statement timely
provides the name, address and operator's license number of any person renting or leasing
the motor vehicle at the time the infraction occurred, then the notice of violation shall be
withdrawn, a letter to that effect shall be sent to the owner by the City, and new notice of
violation shall be issued to the identified person together with a copy of the identifying
statement, which person shall be liable hereunder as if any owner.
In lieu of completing a notice of violation, the Police Department may send a warning notice to
the owner if the system location was established within seven (7) days of the violation, or if
the reviewing officer determines that the recorded images are inconclusive or that it is more
likely than not that a justification applies to the infraction.
The provisions of this Chapter are complementary to, and not instead of, Chapter 315 or any
other provision of the City's Municipal Code, as well as corresponding State Statutes
pertaining to the offense of speeding.
It is the intent of this Chapter to address the conduct and behavior of owners only, and to
ensure that all those who own a vehicle allow only responsible individuals to operate their
vehicle.
Fine.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the City Code of Ordinances, the civil fine for the
infraction of violation of public safety on roadways shall be:
Regular Speed Zone 1: one hundred fifteen dollars ($115.00) for exceeding the limit from
ten (10) to fifteen (15) miles per hour, one hundred thirty-five dollars ($135.00) from
sixteen (16) to nineteen (19) miles per hour, two hundred fifteen dollars ($215.00) more
than twenty (20);
School Speed Zone 1: fifty dollars ($50.00) for exceeding the limit from five (5) to nine
and nine-tenths (9.9) miles per hour, one hundred fifteen dollars ($115.00) for exceeding
the limit from ten (10) to fifteen (15) miles per hour, one hundred thirty-five dollars
($135.00) from sixteen (16) to nineteen (19) miles per hour, two hundred fifteen dollars
($215.00) more than twenty (20);

sixteen (16) to nineteen (19) miles per hour, two hundred eighty-five dollars ($285.00)
more than twenty (20) miles per hour.
Under no circumstances may a person be imprisoned for an infraction. This is a civil violation,
not a criminal offense.
Warning Signs. An automated traffic enforcement system may be identified by advance warning
signs posted at entrances to the City and/or at specific system locations, if the Board determines
that such signs will enhance the efficacy of the system. Absence of such signs shall not provide
justification for an infraction.

the roadway. The provisions of this Subsection shall not relieve the driver of a slowmoving
vehicle from the duty to drive as closely as practicable to the right-hand edge of
the roadway.
Except when a roadway has been divided into three (3) traffic lanes, no vehicle shall be driven to
the left side of the centerline of a highway or public road in overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming
traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction
or any vehicle overtaken.
No vehicle shall at any time be driven to the left side of the roadway under the following
conditions:
When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve of the highway where the driver's
view is obstructed within such distance as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle
might approach from the opposite direction.

viaduct, tunnel or when approaching within one hundred (100) feet of or at any intersection.
Section 340.180. Hand and Mechanical Signals.
No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle from a direct course or
move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable
safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided
further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so
constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such

vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this State
after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.
Section 340.190. Stopping for School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading

Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.150.
Section 340.210. Distance at Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe and
prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the
roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.

Section 342.050. Chemical Tests, Results Admitted Into
Evidence, When, Effect of.
Upon the trial of any person for violation of any of the provisions of Section 565.024, RSMo., or
Section 565.060, RSMo., or Section 342.020 or 342.030 of this Chapter, or in any license
suspension or revocation proceeding pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 302, RSMo., arising
out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving a motor vehicle while in an
intoxicated condition, the amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the time of the act alleged as
shown by any chemical analysis of the person's blood, breath, saliva or urine is admissible in
evidence and the provisions of Subdivision (5) of Section 491.060, RSMo., shall not prevent the
admissibility or introduction of such evidence if otherwise admissible. If there was eighthundredths
of one percent or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, this shall be prima
facie evidence that the person was intoxicated at the time the specimen was taken.
Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per one hundred
(100) milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath.
The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any
other competent evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was intoxicated.
A chemical analysis of a person's breath, blood, saliva or urine, in order to give rise to the
presumption or to have the effect provided for in Subsection (A) of this Section, shall have been
performed as provided in Sections 577.020 to 577.041, RSMo., and in accordance with methods
and standards approved by the State Department of Health and Senior Services.
Any charge alleging a violation of Section 342.020 or 342.030 of this Chapter or any municipal
ordinance prohibiting driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence of alcohol shall be
dismissed with prejudice if a chemical analysis of the defendant's breath, blood, saliva, or urine
performed in accordance with Sections 577.020 to 577.041, RSMo., and rules promulgated
thereunder by the State Department of Health and Senior Services demonstrate that there was
less than eight-hundredths of one percent of alcohol (.08%) in the defendant's blood unless one
(1) or more of the following considerations cause the court to find a dismissal unwarranted:
There is evidence that the chemical analysis is unreliable as evidence of the defendant's
intoxication at the time of the alleged violation due to the lapse of time between the alleged
violation and the obtaining of the specimen;
There is evidence that the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance, or
drug, or a combination of either or both with or without alcohol; or
There is substantial evidence of intoxication from physical observations of witnesses or
admissions of the defendant.

Hearing — Evidence.
If a person under arrest, or who has been stopped pursuant to Subdivision (2) or (3) of Subsection
(A) of Section 342.040 of this Chapter, refuses upon the request of the officer to submit to any test
allowed pursuant to Section 342.040, then none shall be given and evidence of the refusal shall
be admissible in a proceeding pursuant to Section 565.024 or 565.060, RSMo., or Section
342.020 or 342.030 of this Chapter. The request of the officer shall include the reasons of the
officer for requesting the person to submit to a test and also shall inform the person that evidence
of refusal to take the test may be used against such person and that the person's license shall be
immediately revoked upon refusal to take the test. If a person when requested to submit to any
test allowed pursuant to Section 342.040 requests to speak to an attorney, the person shall be
granted twenty (20) minutes in which to attempt to contact an attorney. If upon the completion of
the twenty (20) minute period the person continues to refuse to submit to any test, it shall be
deemed a refusal. In this event, the officer shall, on behalf of the Director of Revenue, serve the
notice of license revocation personally upon the person and shall take possession of any license
to operate a motor vehicle issued by this State which is held by that person. The officer shall issue
a temporary permit, on behalf of the Director of Revenue, which is valid for fifteen (15) days and
shall also give the person a notice of such person's right to file a petition for review to contest the
license revocation.
The officer shall make a sworn report to the Director of Revenue, which shall include the following:
That the officer has:
Reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested person was driving a motor vehicle
while in an intoxicated or drugged condition; or
Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twentyone
(21) years, was driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of twohundredths
of one percent (.02%) or more by weight; or
Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twentyone
(21) years, was committing a violation of the traffic laws of the State or City, and such
officer has reasonable grounds to believe, after making such stop, that the person had a
blood alcohol content of two-hundredths of one percent (.02%) or greater;
That the person refused to submit to a chemical test;
Whether the officer secured the license to operate a motor vehicle of the person;
Whether the officer issued a fifteen (15) day temporary permit;
Copies of the notice of revocation, the fifteen (15) day temporary permit and the notice of the
right to file a petition for review, which notices and permit may be combined in one document;
and
Any license to operate a motor vehicle which the officer has taken into possession.
If a person's license has been revoked because of the person's refusal to submit to a chemical
test, such person may petition for a hearing before a Circuit or Associate Circuit Court in the
County in which the arrest or stop occurred. The person may request such Court to issue an order
staying the revocation until such time as the petition for review can be heard. If the Court, in its
discretion, grants such stay, it shall enter the order upon a form prescribed by the Director of
Revenue and shall send a copy of such order to the Director. Such order shall serve as proof of
the privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State and the Director shall maintain possession of
the person's license to operate a motor vehicle until termination of any revocation pursuant to this
Section. Upon the person's request the Clerk of the Court shall notify the Prosecuting Attorney of

the County and the Prosecutor shall appear at the hearing on behalf of the Director of Revenue. At
the hearing the Court shall determine only:
Whether or not the person was arrested or stopped;
Whether or not the officer had:
Reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving a motor vehicle while in an
intoxicated or drugged condition; or
Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twentyone
(21) years, was driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of twohundredths
of one percent (.02%)or more by weight; or
Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twentyone
(21) years, was committing a violation of the traffic laws of the State, or political
subdivision of the State, and such officer had reasonable grounds to believe, after
making such stop, that the person had a blood alcohol content of two-hundredths of one
percent (.02%) or greater; and
Whether or not the person refused to submit to the test.
No person who has had a license to operate a motor vehicle suspended or revoked pursuant to
the provisions of this Section shall have that license reinstated until such person has participated
in and successfully completed a substance abuse traffic offender program defined in Section
577.001, or a program determined to be comparable by the Department of Mental Health or the
court. Assignment recommendations, based upon the needs assessment as described in
Subdivision (22) of Section 302.010, RSMo., shall be delivered in writing to the person with written
notice that the person is entitled to have such assignment recommendations reviewed by the court
if the person objects to the recommendations. The person may file a motion in the associate
division of the Circuit Court of the County in which such assignment was given, on a printed form
provided by the State Courts Administrator, to have the court hear and determine such motion
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 517, RSMo. The motion shall name the person or entity
making the needs assessment as the respondent and a copy of the motion shall be served upon
the respondent in any manner allowed by law. Upon hearing the motion, the court may modify or
waive any assignment recommendation that the court determines to be unwarranted based upon
a review of the needs assessment, the person's driving record, the circumstances surrounding the
offense, and the likelihood of the person committing a like offense in the future, except that the
court may modify but may not waive the assignment to an education or rehabilitation program of a
person determined to be a prior or persistent offender as defined in Section 577.023, RSMo., or of
a person determined to have operated a motor vehicle with fifteen-hundredths of one percent
(.15%) or more by weight in such person's blood. Compliance with the court determination of the
motion shall satisfy the provisions of this Section for the purpose of reinstating such person's
license to operate a motor vehicle. The respondent's personal appearance at any hearing
conducted pursuant to this Subsection shall not be necessary unless directed by the court.
The fees for the substance abuse traffic offender program, or a portion thereof to be determined
by the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse of the Department of Mental Health, shall be paid by
the person enrolled in the program. Any person who is enrolled in the program shall pay, in
addition to any fee charged for the program, a supplemental fee to be determined by the
Department of Mental Health for the purposes of funding the substance abuse traffic offender
program defined in Sections 302.010 and 577.001, RSMo. The Administrator of the program shall
remit to the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse of the Department of Mental Health on or before
the fifteenth (15th) day of each month the supplemental fee for all persons enrolled in the
program, less two percent for administrative costs. Interest shall be charged on any unpaid

Article III. Miscellaneous Provisions
Section 390.140. Financial Responsibility Required.
No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or required to be registered in this State shall
operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon the streets
or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this Subsection if
he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being
stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1)
person in any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
An insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective
dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit according to Section 303.240,
RSMo.
A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.
Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the insured motor vehicle or by the
operator of the motor vehicle if the proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator
rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.
However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the operator demonstrates to
the court that he/she met the financial responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at
the time the Peace Officer wrote the citation.
Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and
shall upon conviction thereof be punished by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more
than three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each and every violation.

liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid

[CC 1991 §400.580; Ord. No. 119 Art. XIV §§1 — 6, 4-30-1951]
The lawful use of open land for storage purposes and advertising signs and bulletin boards which
do not conform to the provisions of this Chapter shall be discontinued within two (2) years from
April 30, 1951, and the use of land for storage purposes and advertising signs and bulletin boards
which become non-conforming by reason of a subsequent change in this Chapter shall also be
discontinued within two (2) years from the date of the change.
The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the effective date of this Chapter may be
continued although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. A non-conforming use of
a building may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same or of a more restricted
classification. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
Whenever the use of a building becomes non-conforming through a change in the zoning
ordinance or district boundaries, such use may be continued and if no structural alterations are
made, it may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same or of a more restricted
classification.
In the event that a non-conforming use of any building or premises is discontinued for a period of
two (2) years, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the use permitted in the district in
which it is located.
No existing building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the district in
which such building or premises is located, except when required to do so by law or order, shall be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, unless such use is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which such building or premises is located.
When a building, the use of which does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter, is damaged
by fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of
its reasonable value, it shall not be restored except in conformity with the district regulations of the
district in which the building is situated. When a building, the use of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Chapter, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy to the
extent of less than sixty percent (60%) of its reasonable value, it may be restored if the Board of
Adjustment finds some compelling public necessity requiring the continuance of the nonconforming
use and the primary purpose of continuing the non-conforming use is not to continue a
monopoly.

otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of
record on application or notice to the Building Commissioner on good cause shown.
The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give not less than fifteen

Powers And Duties. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall have the following powers and it shall
be its duty:
To hear and decide appeals which it is alleged there is error of law in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Building Commissioner in the enforcement of this
Chapter.
To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot held in a
single ownership on April 30, 1951.
To interpret the provisions of this Chapter in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose
of the plan, as shown upon the map fixing the several districts accompanying and made a
part of this Chapter, where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street
layout as shown on the map aforesaid.
To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises for public utility purposes.
To permit the reconstruction of a non-conforming building which has been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God or public enemy to the extent of less than sixty percent (60%) of its
reasonable value, where the Board finds some compelling public necessity requiring a
continuance of the non-conforming use, and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming
use is not to continue a monopoly.
To permit a variation in the yard requirements of any district where there are practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of these provisions due to an irregular
shape of the lot, topographical or other conditions, provided such variation will not seriously
affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
To authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the
terms of this Chapter relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures or
the use of land will impose upon him/her practical difficulties or particular hardship, such
variations of the strict application of the terms of this Chapter as are in harmony with its
general intent and purpose, but only when the Board is satisfied that a granting of such
variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant but will alleviate some
demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the
Comprehensive Plan as established by this Chapter and at the same time the surrounding
property will be properly protected.
In exercising the above powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the
powers of the Building Commissioner from whom the appeal is taken.

If the evidence supports a finding based upon competent and substantial evidence that the
building or structure is a dangerous building, the Building Commissioner shall issue an order
based upon its findings of fact commanding the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent or
other persons(s) having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the
County wherein the land is located may vacate and demolish said dangerous building at his
own risk to prevent the acquiring by the City of Pine Lawn of the lien against the land where
the dangerous building stands. If the evidence does not support a finding that a building or
structure is a dangerous building, no order shall be issued.
If the owner, occupant, mortgagee or lessee fails to comply with the order within thirty (30)
days, the Building Commissioner shall cause such building or structure to be repaired,
vacated or demolished and the property cleaned up as the facts may warrant; and the
Building Commissioner shall certify the cost of the work borne by the City of Pine Lawn for
such repair, vacation or demolition or cleaned up to the City of Pine Lawn Clerk as a special
assessment represented by a special tax bill against the real property affected; said tax bill
shall be a lien upon said property and shall be deemed a personal debt against the property
owner(s) unless the building or structure is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor
pursuant to an order issued by the City of Pine Lawn and such contractor files a mechanic's
lien against the property where the dangerous building is located. The contractor may enforce
this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360, RSMo. Except as provided in
Subsection (6) of this Section, at the request of the taxpayer this special tax bill may be paid
in installments over a period of not more than ten (10) years; said assessment shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum until paid.
As to damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire,
explosion or other casualty loss, if an order is issued by the Building Commissioner as
provided in Subsection (5) of this Section, and a special tax bill or assessment is issued
against the property, it shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner. If there
are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for damage
or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion or other
casualty loss, the following procedure is established for the payment of up to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the insurance proceeds as set forth in Subdivisions (a) and (b) of this
Subsection. This Subsection shall apply only to a covered claim payment that is in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the face value of the policy covering a building or other structure:
The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to twenty-five percent
(25%) of the covered claim payment and shall pay such monies to the City to deposit into
an interest-bearing account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall
maintain priority over any obligation under the ordinance.
The City of Pine Lawn shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on
such proceeds received under Subdivision (a) of this Subsection to the insured or as the
terms of the policy and endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of such insurance monies unless the City of Pine Lawn has instituted legal
proceeding under the provisions of Subsection (5) of this Section. If the City of Pine Lawn
has proceeded under the provisions of Subsection (5) of this Section, all monies in
excess of that necessary to comply with the provisions of Subsection (5) of this Section
for the removal, securing, repair and clean up of the building or structure and the lot on
which it is located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (6) of this Section,
at the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not
more than ten (10) years. The tax bill shall be a lien on the property and a personal debt
against the property owner(s) until paid.
Subsection (6) of this Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims
arising on all buildings and structures.

Section 505.005. Procedure Overview.
[Ord. No. 2010-09 §1, 3-10-2010]
In an effort to ensure compliance with this Chapter, all signs require permits through the City of Pine
Lawn except where otherwise stated within this Chapter.
Section 505.010. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 2010-09 §1, 3-10-2010]
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the City of Pine Lawn are enacting this Chapter to ensure
that non-commercial messages are authorized with restriction only as to the size of such signage
and to establish reasonable regulations for signage containing commercial messages. The Mayor
and Board of Aldermen find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals
may convey a variety of non-commercial and commercial messages. However, left completely
unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to
property values and the City's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance.
By enacting this amendment, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen intend to:
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the
public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
Maintain the historical image of the City;
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused
by signs;
Promote economic development; and
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

designate an individual, a firm, an association, a corporation, a profession, a business or a commodity
or products which are visible from any public street or adjacent property and used to attract attention.
This definition includes the structure or the face on which a sign message is displayed. For the

bracing must be used as necessary to keep the sides of the trench vertical and to prevent caving.
Adequate provision for proper drainage of the areas surrounding the work must be maintained at
all times.
All excavations must be completed in a timely manner and maintain traffic flows at all times in

injured in making any excavation must be restored, replaced and repaired to as good condition as
existed before such excavation was made.
Every person who makes or causes to be made any excavation in or adjoining any public way or
place shall provide, erect and maintain at all times along the lines of work all such barricades,
signs, lights and warning signals as may be necessary to protect the public from the hazards
arising from the operation.

"St. Louis County Standard Specifications for Highway Construction". Failure to provide
proper traffic control, protect the streets from possible damage, protect City park property, and
provide proper safety measures in the interest of public safety shall result in the City taking
whatever action is necessary to restore disrupted areas and the immediate revocation of this
excavation permit, as well as undertake legal action to recover expended public funds above
the submitted deposit amount.
Applicant must maintain street traffic flow at all times.
Any and all other work necessary to provide a complete and satisfactory job must be
undertaken by applicant.
The work must be completed in the established time frame.
No requirements of this permit shall prevent a public utility company from making emergency
repairs which benefit the health, welfare and the general well-being of the City's residents.
All excavation and restoration work in the public rights-of-way shall conform to the applicable
Standard Construction Specifications For Sewers And Drainage Facilities of the Metropolitan St.

The work of placing and compacting granular backfill and repaving excavated areas in paved
streets and walks is to be performed by the Department of Public Works of the City of Pine Lawn
at the sole cost of the person, firm or corporation making the excavation, except that contractors
approved by the City and utility companies engaged in the construction, replacement or repair of
utility lines in paved areas shall be required to perform granular backfill and repaving operations
as part of the construction or replacement project and to furnish the City satisfactory guaranty
covering performance of the work in accordance with the above specifications. Contractors and
utility companies engaged in the construction, replacement or repair of utility lines in paved areas
shall backfill the trench with the granular material.
In the restoration of paved areas (including any street constructed with a soil-cement base), the
type of materials used for the replacement of base and surface shall be the same as those which
were removed, and such replacement shall be accomplished in compliance with the requirements
of the City or their authorized representative.
In addition to any other fee required herein, an inspection fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per
hour, while backfilling and repaving is in process, shall be paid to the City by any contractor or
utility company performing backfill and repaving in paved streets, driveways and walks with either
granular material or excavated material.

The approximate cost of granular backfill and repaving operations to be performed by the
Department of Public Works of the City for the person desiring to make an excavation under or
through the paved portion of any street or walkway will be estimated by the City at the time
application for excavation permit is submitted and shall be deposited with the City as a
prerequisite to the issuance of the permit. The rates to be charged in preparing cost estimates
shall be at the prevailing rate, as reasonably determined by the City in their sole discretion.
Upon completion of the backfilling and repaving by the Department of Public Works, a final
estimate of the actual quantities of work done will be prepared by the City; if such final estimate is
less than the original estimate, refund will be made; if such final estimate is greater, a charge will
be made for the balance and no subsequent excavation permit will be issued until such balance
has been paid in full.
Section 515.090. Liability Insurance Required.
Every applicant for an excavation permit shall file with the City proof that the applicant is
maintaining liability insurance in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for any
injuries or damages received or sustained by any person, persons or property on account of the
excavation work or on account of or in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding the work.
Such insurance must be carried with a firm or corporation which has been licensed to carry on
such business in the State of Missouri and must be kept continuously in force as long as the
excavation work is in process. A copy of the certificate of insurance policy must be filed with the
City, with proof that the policy is in full force and effect, and that said insurance will not be altered,
amended, terminated or ended without prior notice having been given to the City.

thousand dollars ($100,000.000), conditioned that it will pay any judgment recovered by any
person or persons injured, or any property damage incurred, on account of the excavation work or
on account of or in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding the work.
In the event any such insurance policy lapses and is not immediately renewed, or any such bond
terminates in any manner whatsoever and a substitute in lieu thereof is not deposited, the permit
for the excavation shall be revoked immediately.
Section 515.100. Emergency Excavations.
In case of an emergency where the public health or safety is endangered and the office of the City is
not open for business, the provisions of this Article relating to the issuance of permits prior to
commencement of work of excavation shall not apply. In such case, the person making the excavation
shall notify the Police Department of the City that emergency work is being commenced and the
location thereof, and the work may proceed immediately following the procedures hereinabove
provided for backfilling; provided however, final surfacing or temporary patches shall not be applied to
the excavation until such time as the City has inspected and approved the backfill and issued a permit
therefor. Application for the permit shall be made on the first (1st) day on which the office of the City is

additional facilities within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the
requests or permittees to occupy and use the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the City shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way,
but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the

right-of-way and future City plans for public improvements and development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest.

within roadway limits, in arterial and other high volume streets and in streets constructed or
resurfaced within the last three (3) years, unless otherwise approved by the City and such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The City may require trenchless technology in other
locations, where extreme circumstances prevent or make open cut methods impractical.
Applicants may use either the open cut method or trenchless technology for major and minor
projects outside roadway limits.
Right-Of-Way Restoration.
The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the right-of-way as required
herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit. All temporary patching of

permittee must restore the general area of the work, including all disturbed landscaping
materials and the permitted areas, including paving and its foundation, per the City's
construction standards.
The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the City including, but not limited to, the construction standards.
Guarantee of work outside roadway limits. The permittee, by acceptance of the permit,
expressly warrants and guarantees complete performance of the work in compliance with the
rights-of-way construction and administration ordinance and the City's construction standards
and warrants and guarantees all work done for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the
date of completion. During this twenty-four (24) month period, the permittee shall, upon

to the extent necessary using the method required by the department. Said work shall be
completed within the time specified by the City.

the department, make all necessary repairs and correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the department. Said work shall be completed within
the time specified by the City.

permittee's expense, security for the warranty guarantee in the form of cash, an irrevocable

desiring to repair their driveway or sidewalk, provided the owner performs the work
personally and upon satisfactory evidence to the City that the owner is competent to
perform the work.
Performance bond provided as security shall be executed by the permittee as principal
and by at least one (1) surety upon whom service of process may be had in this State
and shall be deposited with the City. The bond shall be in an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the City's estimate of the cost of restoration, as defined
above, but in no case shall the amount be less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).

guarantee is in effect for work covered by the rights-of-way construction and

safety or well-being of the public.
The City may issue a notice of violation to the permittee for work which does not

To any person who has failed to comply with the requirements of this Article;
To any person who is delinquent in paying a debt owed to the City; and

convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the right-of-way and by considerations
relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
Permissive denial. The City may deny a permit in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
right-of-way or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its users. The City may

the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan shall be cause for immediate issuance of a stop work order and
issuance of a municipal offense ticket.
From time to time, the City may establish a list of conditions of the permit that will
automatically warrant the issuance of a municipal offense ticket to the permittee.
Section 515.190. Indemnification and Liability.
[Ord. No. 2009-32, 2009]
City Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the grant of a right-of-way permit, the City does not
assume liability:
For injuries to persons, damage to property or loss of service claims by parties other than the
applicant or the City; or
For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance or
operation of facilities by applicants or activities of applicants.
Applicant Or Permittee Indemnifies City. By accepting a permit, a permittee is required to
indemnify and hold the City whole and harmless from all costs, liabilities and claims for damages
of any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation
of its facilities or out of activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it
will not bring, nor cause to be brought, action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages or
seeking other relief against the City for claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities or any activity undertaken in or near a rightof-
way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit.
The foregoing does not indemnify the City for its own negligence. This Section is not, as to third
(3rd) parties, a waiver of defense or immunity otherwise available to the applicant or to the City;
and the applicant, in defending action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any action
every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.
Exceptions. The provisions of Subsection (B) of this Section shall not apply to a permittee that
has, as of the effective date of this Article, a valid franchise duly granted by the City and said
franchise requires the permittee to hold harmless the City for damages occasioned by the
presence, operations or maintenance of the permittee's facilities. This exemption shall not apply

[Ord. No. 2009-32, 2009]
Penalties. Any person who violates of the provisions of this Article shall, upon conviction, be punished
in accordance with Section 100.220 of this Code.
Section 515.210. General Provisions.
[Ord. No. 2009-32, 2009]
Non-Exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in this Article are not exclusive or in lieu of other
rights and remedies that the City may have at law or in equity. The City is hereby authorized to
seek legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the public right-of-way, including
damages to the right-of-way, whether caused by a violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter
or other provisions of this Article.
Severability. If any Section, Subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Chapter is for
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order that any permit or right
or portions of this Chapter is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a permit with a mutual right in either party to
terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days' written notice to the other. The requirements
and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set
forth in the permit or right respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the permit and
the right of termination. If a permit or right shall be considered a revocable permit as provided
herein, the permittee must acknowledge the authority of the Board of Aldermen to issue such
revocable permit and the power to revoke it.
Reservation Of Regulatory And Police Powers. The City, by the granting of a right-of-way permit,
does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair or lessen the lawful powers and rights,
which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the City under the Constitution and Statutes of the
State to regulate the use of the right-of-way by the permittee or to charge reasonable
compensation for such use; and the permittee by its acceptance of a right-of-way permit must
agree that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power or police power or otherwise as are or the
same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the City shall be in full force and effect
and subject to the exercise thereof by the City at any time. A permittee or applicant is deemed to
acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to
agree to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to
such powers.
Any conflict between the provisions of a right-of-way permit and other present or future lawful
exercise of the City's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter.

Chapter 525. Sewer Lateral Repair Program
Section 525.010. Sewer Lateral Repair Program.
[Ord. No. 815 §1, 5-17-1999; Ord. No. 845 §§1 — 2, 5-14-2001; Ord. No. 860 §§I — II, 1-14-2002]
A "sewer lateral" is defined as the position of the sewage system that carries household wastes to
the MSD or private sewer main and which lies between the residential dwelling's structure
foundation wall or exterior wall and the sewer main. The definition is the same whether the pipe is
located in the front, side or rear yard. Damage or blocked pipes located within the exterior walls of
the unit are not covered under this program.
This service is not available to commercial or industrial property. Also, this service is not available
to multi-family buildings.
If an owner is experiencing a problem with the lateral sewer service line, the owner should contact
a plumbing company or a drain and sewer cleaning company licensed by St. Louis County to have
the lined cabled. Sometimes the problem is not with the sewer line, but it may have become
clogged up from the entry of improper materials into the line. The cost of cleaning out the sewer
line will not be a reimbursable cost item.
If the problem is not resolved by cabling of the line, the property owner should contact the City of
Pine Lawn between the hours of 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Monday through Friday. The owner must
fill out an application with the City Clerk at City Hall in triplicate.
Before being processed, each property owner must provide a copy of the property owner's most
recent paid real estate tax bills (which must show said property owner is current in all obligations
shown thereon) and must similarly provide proof of having all balances paid and current with
respect to any and all City fees and taxes, including personal property taxes and trash fees.
The City may arrange for the Metropolitan Sewer District to perform a dye test. In most instances,
this will disclose whether there is a break in the sewer service line.
If a dye test is performed and does not indicate a break in the sewer service line, the owner may
hire a contractor to televise the line so that the cause of the problem can be determined. If that
discloses that the line is defective, the cost of such testing to a maximum of one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) is includable as part of the reimbursable cost.
When it is determined from the television inspection that the service line is defective, bids shall be
solicited for the necessary repair work from a least three (3) plumbing contractors or drainlayer

firms licensed to perform such work in St. Louis County to ensure that the bidders have given a
fair, competitive bid.
From the bids it has received, the City of Pine Lawn may hire the contractor which it determines
has submitted the lowest responsible bid to repair the sewer service line. The contract shall obtain
any necessary permits from the City of Pine Lawn and St. Louis County, perform the work in
compliance with applicable St. Louis County and Pine Lawn codes and submit an itemized bill to
the City of Pine Lawn upon completion of the repair work. The contractor is expected to
accomplish the contracted work within a fourteen (14) day period.
The corrective work which is subject to reimbursement from the fund is limited to excavation,
repair or replacement of the defective portion of the line, backfilling and seeding and strawing of
the disturbed portion of the yard. Additional work shall be done at the homeowner's expense.
Upon completion of the corrective work and confirmation that the contracted work has been
accomplished, the City of Pine Lawn will pay the contractor for one hundred percent (100%) of the
corrective work, not to exceed the amount of the approved bid, and not to exceed the sum of five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per repair.
The City of Pine Lawn has no obligation or responsibility for the performance by the contractor and
no responsibility for any damages caused to the owner's property because of the sewer line
defects.

as, but not limited to, earthquake, tornadoes, floods or other natural disasters.

A separate license shall be required for each place of business. Every license issued under

Article I. In General
Section 605.010. Standards for Business License Decisions.
[Ord. No. 844 §§I — V, 5-12-2001]
The City of Pine Lawn shall consider the following factors in deciding upon the granting, denial,
revocation, non-revocation, renewal or non-renewal of any business license (hereinafter "business
license decisions"):
The adherence or non-adherence by the business at issue to all validly adopted and
constitutional ordinances and laws of the City.
The adherence or non-adherence by the business to all validly adopted and constitutional
Statutes and laws of the State of Missouri and the United States.
The adherence or non-adherence by the business to the reasonable and lawful orders of the
City's Police and other public health/safety officers.
The currency or delinquency of the business with respect to any and all just and lawful
accounts or other debts with the City.
The application, if any, before the City including the tendering of full payment of all just and
lawful fees therefor and such application's completeness and accuracy.
Reasonable concerns for the public health, safety and welfare specifically including, but not
necessarily limited to, the business' effect and/or reasonably likely effect on crime.
The City may request the opinion of the City Attorney from time to time with respect to the legal
propriety of any business license decision. The City may consider any such opinion which may be

provided in response to such a request in addition to the factors above and may take such action
as may be reasonable with respect to such business license decisions provided the City
reasonably relies on such opinion's accuracy and legal validity.
The City Board Of Aldermen may itself directly make business license decisions or it may
designate a hearing officer or committee or board to make such decisions on any given case or
sets of cases subject to ratification by the Board of Aldermen. Any person, business or entity
aggrieved by any business license decision of the City, however, may request a hearing before the
Board of Aldermen at which hearing such aggrieved person, business or entity may be
represented by counsel. Such request must be made in writing and received by the City within a
reasonable time after first having actual or constructive notice of the business license decision and
in no case later than thirty (30) days. Such hearing may be reasonably limited in length by the
Mayor or City Attorney, either one (1) of whom shall preside over such hearing.
The City may decide to revoke, deny or not renew a business license without regard to whether
business licenses were granted or renewed or not revoked in the past. The mere previous
granting or renewal or non-revocation of a business license, even if automatic or ministerial (or
seemingly automatic or ministerial), shall not be cause for any expectation of any particular result
in any given future business license decision. Business license decisions are made solely for the
benefit of the City; the granting or renewal or non-revocation of any given business license shall
not be relied upon or interpreted as an acknowledgement by the City that such business is
necessarily:
In full compliance with all applicable laws, orders and ordinances,
Current with the City in its economic obligations, or
Approved by the City or any of its employees in terms of such business' effect on the public
health, morals, safety and/or crime.
Whenever a business license decision involves revocation, written notice of such decision shall be
mailed or delivered, at least three (3) days in advance of such decision's effective date, to the
address reflected on the most recent application for license or renewal made by such business.
Provided however, that where such revocation decision is caused by a reasonably perceived
immediate threat to public personal safety or other exigent and extreme circumstances, such
notice need not be provided.

Section 645.090. Security Fund.
[Ord. No. 777 §9, 8-21-1996]
Prior to a franchise becoming effective and/or renewed, a franchisee must post with the City a
cash security deposit to be used as a security fund ("Security Fund" or "Fund") to ensure the
timely and faithful performance of all obligations under this Chapter, the franchise and all other
provisions of law, as well as with all orders, permits and directions of the City pertaining to said
franchise, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees or taxes due the City that
arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system. The Security Fund
shall be initially equal to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00).
The City Clerk shall place the security deposit in a non-interest-bearing account.
If the City determines to exercise its rights to withdraw funds from the Security Fund, the City may,
after ten (10) calendar days' written notice to the franchisee, withdraw said funds from the Security
Fund unless, within such ten (10) day period, the franchisee objects to such withdrawal and
requests in writing a hearing before the Board. If the Board, after such hearing, determines that
the City is entitled to withdraw funds from the security deposit, the City may withdraw said funds
from the security deposit. The City shall notify the franchisee in writing of the amount and date of
any withdrawal.
Within thirty (30) calendar days after written notice of a withdrawal, the franchisee must deposit a
sum of money sufficient to restore the Security Fund to its original amount. If the franchisee fails to
so restore the fund, the entire fund remaining may be forfeited and/or such failure may be
considered a material breach of this Chapter and may be used as grounds for revocation of the
franchise.
Following the termination of a franchise, the franchisee is entitled to the return of that portion of
the Security Fund that remains, provided that there is no outstanding default or other amounts due
the City by the franchisee and, provided further, that said Security Fund shall not be disbursed
until such time as franchisee delivers to the City Administrator a writing which certifies to the City
that:
All plant and equipment which franchisee elects to remove from the City has been removed in
accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances governing the same, and
Any remaining plant and/or equipment is abandoned, and franchisee disclaims any ownership
interest therein.
In addition, any amounts due the City shall be withdrawn from the Security Fund prior to
its final release.
No action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the Security Fund will affect any other
right the City may have.

[Ord. No. 777 §10, 8-21-1996]
Prior to the issuance by the City of any permits for construction in the streets or public property, a
franchisee shall present, or have on file with the City, a faithful performance bond ("performance
bond" or "bond"), separate and apart from the Security Fund set forth in Section 645.090 of this
Chapter, running to the City with one (1) good and sufficient surety approved by the City ("bonding
company"). The franchisee shall maintain said bond throughout the period of initial construction or
reconstruction of the system as set forth in the franchise. The bond shall have a penal sum equal
to the greater of:
Ten percent (10%) of the aggregate cost which the City Engineer reasonably estimates will be
incurred to complete the proposed construction, or
Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
This bond may be reduced to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) upon completion of
the upgrade. The bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the
franchisee and upon the further condition that in the event the franchisee shall fail to
complete the required construction of the system as set forth in the franchise, there shall
be recoverable, jointly and severally, from the principal and the surety of the bond any
damage or loss suffered by the City as a result of said construction, including the full
amount of any cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee, plus
an allowance for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs up to the full amount of the bond.
The Bond shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled nor the intention not to
renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City Clerk by certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew.
The bond shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Secretary of State of Missouri and a
certificate from the Missouri Department of Insurance which authorize the bonding company to
conduct business within Missouri. The bonding company must have attained and shall maintain for
the duration of the bond a rating from A. M. Best's or Standard and Poor's of not less than "A" as
evidence of its solvency. A certificate from the original issuing company stating that the bond is in
effect shall also be submitted.
The bond and the certificates required in Subsection (C) shall be filed and maintained with the City
Clerk.
Upon substantial completion of all construction and/or reconstruction within the streets authorized
or required by its franchise, a franchisee may request in writing to the Board that the bond be
reduced to an amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or two (2) times the estimated cost of
the remaining construction, whichever is greater. Upon the completion of all remaining
construction and/or reconstruction, the franchisee shall request in writing that the requirement for
said bond be terminated. The Board shall, after satisfying itself of the appropriateness of such
request, approve the franchisee's request for reduction or cancellation of the required
performance bond. Prior to any additional required construction within the streets or public
property within the service area, a performance bond as described in Section 645.100(A) shall be
submitted and maintained during said additional construction in its original penal sum.

In addition to all other rights and powers pertaining to the City by virtue of any franchise or
otherwise, the City reserves the right to impose liquidated damages, revoke, terminate and cancel
any franchise and all rights and privileges of a franchisee thereunder in the event that the

such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the
City and the franchisee;
Fails to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and indemnification coverage as
required herein;
Violates any agreements, orders or rulings of the FCC or any other regulatory body having
jurisdiction over the franchisee relative to this franchise, including, without limitation, any

such agreements, orders or rulings are being diligently contested in good faith by the
franchisee in a court of competent jurisdiction;
Fails to receive necessary FCC approvals within the applicable and appropriate time;
Ceases or fails to provide services for reasons within the control of the franchisee. A
franchisee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of
its franchise or this Chapter in any case in which performance of any such provision is
prevented for reasons beyond the franchisee's control; or
Attempts to evade any of the provisions of this Chapter or its franchise agreement or
practices any fraud or deceit upon the City.
In the event that the City believes that a franchisee has not complied with the terms of its
franchise, the City shall notify the franchisee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
Franchisee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in Section 645.110(B)
to:
Respond to the City contesting the assertion of non-compliance; or
Cure such default; or
In the event that, by the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty
(30) day period, the franchisee shall initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and
notify the City Administrator of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be
completed, but in no event shall said default continue for more than sixty (60) days from the
date on which said written notice of non-compliance was given by the City.
In the event that a franchisee fails to respond to the notice described in Section 645.110(B)
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 645.110(C), or in the event that the alleged default
is not remedied within the applicable time permitted by Section 645.110(C), the City Administrator
shall notify the Board of said default. A public meeting shall be held by the Board within thirty (30)
days after the above notice is received. The Board shall notify the franchisee, in writing, of the
time and place of such meeting and provide the franchisee with an opportunity to be heard.
In the event the Board, after such meeting, determines that a franchisee is in default of any
provision of its franchise and/or this Chapter, the Board may:
Impose a penalty in such amount, whether per day, incident or other measure of violation, of
up to three hundred dollars ($300.00) per day. Payment of said penalty by a franchisee will
not relieve a franchisee of its obligation to meet its franchise requirements;

Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief;
Seek specific performance of any provision, which lends itself to such remedy, as an
alternative to damages; or
In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the franchise, declare the
franchise to be revoked.
A franchisee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly with any provision of
its franchise by reason of any failure of the Board to enforce prompt compliance.
In a situation where a franchise is revoked, in removing its plant and equipment the franchisee
shall obtain the prior written consent of the City, which will not be unreasonably withheld, prior to
commencing any excavation of any street. Franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws and
ordinances governing excavation of the streets and, if necessary, shall refill, at its own expense,
any excavation that shall be made by it. Franchisee shall leave all streets and public property in as
good or better condition as prevailed prior to the franchisee's removal of its plant and equipment
without effecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The City shall inspect and
approve the condition of the streets and public property. Liability, indemnity and insurance as
provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full
compliance by the franchisee with the terms and conditions of this Subsection and this Chapter.
In the event of a failure by a franchisee to complete any work required by Section 645.110(G) or
any other work required by City law or ordinance within the time as may be established and to the
satisfaction of the City, the City may cause such work to be performed and the franchisee shall
reimburse the City the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such
costs. The City shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this
Subsection.
Upon the expiration of the term of the franchise or the revocation of a franchise, the City may
require the franchisee to continue to operate the system for a period not to exceed six (6) months
from the date of such expiration and/or revocation. The franchisee shall, as trustee for its
successor in interest, continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of its

permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this Subsection.
The termination and forfeiture of any franchise shall in no way affect any of the rights of the City or
franchisee under the franchise or any provision of law.
Section 645.120. Transfer of Ownership or Control.
[Ord. No. 777 §12, 8-21-1996]
A franchise granted by the City to a franchisee shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the
public. A franchisee's rights, title and/or interest in the franchise and the system constructed
pursuant thereto shall not, whether in whole or in part, be sold, exchanged, transferred or
otherwise disposed of to any person (other than to a wholly owned affiliate) without the prior
written consent of the City, and then only under such conditions as the City may establish. Such
consent as required by the City shall, however, not be unreasonably withheld or delayed more
than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the City receives written notification of any said
proposed transfer, exchange, sale or assignment. Simultaneously with said written notification, the
franchisee and/or the proposed transferee shall deliver to the City detailed financial information
pertaining to the proposed transferee (including, without limitation, audited or reviewed financial
statements), its technical qualifications and its proposed customer service location. In addition, the
franchisee shall cause the proposed transferee to deliver such other additional information as the

exchange, transfer or other disposition will in all events be expressly conditioned upon full
compliance with the provisions of the franchise and this Chapter, and the transferee shall agree in
writing to comply with all provisions of this Chapter and the franchise.
No change in, transfer of or acquisition by any other party of "control" of the franchisee shall occur
without the prior written consent of the City, and then only under such conditions as the City may
establish. A change in, transfer of or acquisition by any other party of "control" has occurred if
thirty percent (30%) or more of the voting common stock in the franchisee is transferred in one (1)
or a series of related transactions. Such consent as required by the City shall, however, not be

Section 645.380. Scope.
[Ord. No. 744 §0, 5-9-1994]
This Article governs the regulation of rates for basic cable television service and associated equipment
provided within the City. The City will enforce and interpret this Article in accordance with Federal and
State law, including all Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations governing the
regulation of basic service rates and associated equipment.
Section 645.390. Filing and Review of Rates.
[Ord. No. 744 §1, 5-9-1994]
Filings By Cable Operators.
Filings — when made. Within thirty (30) days after the initial date of regulation of its basic
service tier under this Article (or June 15, 1994, if later), a cable operator must file its
schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment, a full description of the
services available in the basic service tier, and all forms prescribed by the FCC to establish
initial regulated rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment, unless the cable
system is eligible for streamlined rate reductions under FCC regulations and implements the
required reduction and provides written notice thereof in accordance with FCC regulations. In
addition, after initial regulated rates have been established to change regulated rates for the
basic service tier and associated equipment, a cable operator must file thirty (30) days before
the proposed effective date of the change any proposed new schedule of rates, related
description of the services available in the basic service tier, all forms prescribed by the FCC,
and proof of customer notice as required by the FCC. Rate changes include decreases,
including annual reductions due to decreases in external costs and quarterly reductions due
to decreases in programming costs resulting from deletion of a channel or channels from the
basic service tier.
Filings — where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the cable coordinator
(hereinafter "coordinator") designated by the City. A rate filing shall be considered filed for
review on the date all required forms (correctly completed) and supporting materials and all
required copies are submitted to the coordinator. If a filing is incomplete, the coordinator may
require the cable operator to supplement the filing and all time deadlines regarding the City's
review of the filing shall be suspended.
Filings — cover letter and copies.
Every rate filing must be accompanied by a covering letter which states whether the filing
concerns existing rates, proposes a rate increase or proposes a rate decrease. The
covering letter must also identify any elections the cable operator is making regarding
applicable FCC regulations. The covering letter must state whether the cable operator
claims any of the information it has submitted is proprietary. The covering letter must also
contain a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service,
including the precise amount of any rate change and an explanation of the cause thereof,
and the identification of any added or deleted channels.

public that a filing has been received. The notice shall state that the filing is available for
public review, except for those parts withheld as proprietary, and shall state reasonable
time(s) and place(s) for such review. The notice shall state that interested parties may
comment on the filing and shall establish the time and manner in which interested parties may
submit their comments in light of the date by which the City must act upon the filing.

a written order which may be in any lawful form. The order shall approve the proposed rates
in whole or in part; deny the proposed rates in whole or in part; or state that additional time is
required to review the filing because the City is unable to determine, based on the material
submitted by the cable operator, that the rates are in accordance with FCC regulations. An
order stating additional time is required shall permit the cable operator to cure any deficiency
in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing as provided in Subsection (C). If the City
disapproves the proposed rates, it may order a reduction or prescribe rates where necessary
to bring rates into compliance with this Article and FCC regulations.
Effective date of filing. Unless the Board of Aldermen disapproves the filing or issues an order
stating that additional time is required to review the filing within thirty (30) days after the filing
date, initial rates will remain effective or proposed rates will become effective. Unless the
order or a subsequent order states otherwise, if the City decides more time is required to
review the filing, the filing will remain subject to disapproval until after, and no proposed
change will go into effect any earlier than, the time for further action by the City provided in
Subsection (C)(6) has passed. If the City takes no action within the time provided in Section
(C)(6), initial rates shall remain in effect or proposed rates shall take effect, subject to refund if
applicable.
Order released and notice published. Notice of the rate order shall be given to the cable
operator. A public notice shall be published stating that the order has issued and is available
for review at specified reasonable time(s) and place(s).

form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or
in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in whole or in part, subject to refund, pending
further investigation. If the City disapproves the proposed rate, it may order a reduction or
prescribe rates where necessary to bring rates into compliance with this Article and FCC
regulations. If the Board of Aldermen issues an order allowing the rates to go into effect
subject to refund, it shall also direct the cable operator to keep an accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the rates in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were
paid.

cable operator's rates and order appropriate relief without the participation of the cable
operator.

refunds should issue; and notify the cable operator of its recommendation at the time it is
submitted to the Board of Aldermen.
Section 645.440. Joint Regulation.
[Ord. No. 744 §6, 5-9-1994]
To the extent permitted by law, the City may conduct cable regulation pursuant to this Article jointly with
other municipalities in St. Louis County, Missouri, served by the same cable operator including, but not
limited to, joint certification, acting through a common coordinator, holding joint proceedings, providing
joint notices and conducting joint reviews of filings. The Board of Aldermen shall retain the final
authority to make determinations hereunder and shall issue separate orders.
Section 645.450. Penalties and Forfeitures.
[Ord. No. 744 §7, 5-9-1994]
Except as prohibited by Federal or State law, a cable operator which violates this Article or any
City order issued hereunder directed specifically to the cable operator shall be subject to penalties
and forfeitures under the Municipal Code or, if applicable, the City's cable ordinance.
Charging or filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable is not in and of
itself an evasion of Federal or local rate regulation and does not provide a basis for assessing
penalties or forfeitures.
Section 645.460. Proprietary Information.
[Ord. No. 744 §8, 5-9-1994]
Requests For Protection Of Proprietary Information. If this Article, or any request for information
made pursuant hereto, requires the production of proprietary information, a cable operator must
produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is submitted, a
cable operator may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as
confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. Requests
for confidential treatment, or for inspection of proprietary information, will be reviewed and decided
by the coordinator in accordance with applicable FCC regulations and applicable State and local
law.
Identification Of Proprietary Information. Information that the cable operator claims is proprietary
must be clearly identified as such by the cable operator. If it is part of a larger submission, such as
a rate filing, the proprietary information must be segregated from the remainder of the submission.
It must also be clearly marked so that the City may determine where the proprietary information
belongs within and how it relates to the remainder of the submission.
Section 645.470. Petition for Change in Regulatory Status.
[Ord. No. 744 §9, 5-9-1994]
Any cable operator may petition for a change in regulatory status based on development of effective
competition, and the City shall consider such a petition in accordance with FCC regulations. The cable
operator must file an original and fifteen (15) copies of the petition with the coordinator. If there are
multiple cable operators providing locally regulated service within the City, each operator must file a
separate petition and receive a separate decision from the City.

Section 645.480. Itemization of Bills.
[Ord. No. 744 §10, 5-9-1994]
A cable operator shall itemize its bills so that the charges for basic service, equipment and
installation are separately stated. A cable operator may, but is not required to, identify as a
separate line item on each regular bill of each subscriber in accordance with FCC regulations:
The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee and the identity of the franchising
authority to which the fee is paid;
The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirements imposed on the cable
operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational or governmental channels
or the use of such channels; and
The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment or charge of any kind imposed by any
governmental authority on the transaction between operator and the subscriber. In order for a
governmental fee or assessment to be separately identified under this Subsection, it must be
directly imposed by a governmental body on a transaction between a subscriber and an
operator. The charge identified on the subscriber's bill as the total charge for cable service
shall include all itemized fees and costs.
Section 645.490. Late Charges.
[Ord. No. 744 §11, 5-9-1994]
A cable operator shall not impose a late charge upon any subscriber who pays for service within fifteen
(15) days after the end of the month in which the service was provided. Late charges shall not exceed
seventy-five hundredths percent (0.75%) per month.
