discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or vote which does not
directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed
meeting or vote. Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting
shall close only an existing portion of the meeting facility necessary to
house the members of the public governmental body in the closed
session, allowing members of the public to remain to attend any
subsequent open session held by the public governmental body
following the closed session.

as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall
separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt
material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies
provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to
the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to
inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe
the material exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of
the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.

access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.
B. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hours' notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public, the
nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes.

meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.

body or its custodian without written permission of the designated
custodian. No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998,
grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise,

uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.
C. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon
as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third (3rd) business
day following the date the request is received by the custodian of
records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a
certain format, the public body shall provide the records in the
requested format, if such format is available. If access to the public
record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed
explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest
time and date that the record will be available for inspection. This
period for document production may exceed three (3) days for
reasonable cause.
D. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon
request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is
denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of
the third (3rd) business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.

shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the County in which the public
governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of a
summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil
action brought to enforce the provisions of Sections 610.010 to
610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the subject
matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or
otherwise dispose of the public record sought to be inspected and
examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an exemption pursuant
Section
120.090
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
120.100
100:63
to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record
is not a public record until the court directs otherwise.
B. Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., demonstrates to the court that the body in question is
subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., and
has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion
shall be on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with
the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
C. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has
knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the public
governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in
an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds
that there is a knowing violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully
establishing a violation. The court shall determine the amount of the
penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body
or member of a public governmental body has violated Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
D. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has
purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the public
governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in
an amount up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds
that there was a purposeful violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member
of all costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully
establishing such a violation. The court shall determine the amount of
the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body
or member of a public governmental body has violated Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
E. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body has violated any provision of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in violation of
Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts
of the particular case that the public interest in the enforcement of the
policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., outweighs the public
interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed
meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within
one (1) year from which the violation is ascertainable and in no event
shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the violation. This
Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of
bonds or other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body

closing a particular meeting, record or vote may bring suit at the
expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court of the
County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to
ascertain the propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of
the attorney general or an attorney for the governmental body.
A. Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body
shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish copies of public
records subject to the following:
1. Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted

page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14)
inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the
average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records
requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based
on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall
produce the copies using employees of the body that result in the
lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the
person requesting the records may request the public
governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public
governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester.
2. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films,
pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches shall include only the cost of copies, staff time,

the public governmental body required for making copies and
programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other
medium used for the duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats
that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual
rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to
duplicate such maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is
required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
Section

request for records or information, the fees for compliance may

Alcohol And Substance Abuse Policy5
DIVISION 1
Drug-Free Workplace Policy
Section 125.010. Purpose. [Ord. No. 7052 §§1—2, 1-27-2003]
The City values its employees and recognizes their need for a safe and
healthy work environment. Furthermore, employees abusing drugs and
alcohol are less productive and are often a risk to the safety and
productivity of our City. The establishment of a Drug-Free Workplace Policy
is consistent with this City's desire to promote a safe and accident-free
workplace.
Section 125.020. Policy. [Ord. No. 7052 §§1—2, 1-27-2003]
Section 125.030. Disciplinary Action. [Ord. No. 7052 §§1—2,
1-27-2003]
The City reserves the right to use mandatory referral, evaluation and
treatment, including disciplinary actions up to and including termination
of employment, depending upon the seriousness of the violation, the
employee's present job assignment, the employee's record with the City and
other factors, including the impact of the violation upon the conduct of City
business. In a first (1st) violation situation, the City's preferred response
will be mandatory referral, evaluation and treatment without termination
of employment; however, the City may implement immediate termination in
a first (1st) violation situation if, in the City Administrator's judgment, the
circumstances warrant such action.
A. It is the policy of the City to maintain a workplace free from the use and
abuse of illegal drugs and alcohol. Compliance with this policy is a
condition of continued employment. At any time, the City may
unilaterally, at its discretion, amend, supplement, modify or change any
part of this policy. The policy does not represent an expressed or
implied contract and does not affect your status as an at-will employee.
B. To maintain a drug-free workplace, the City has established the
following policy effective January 27, 2003, with regard to the use,
possession and sale of illegal drugs and alcohol. Drug and alcohol
testing practices will be adopted to identify employees or applicants
using drugs and/or alcohol.
C. Non-compliance with this policy, which may result from either a refusal
to submit violation or a positive test result, shall result in severe
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
5. Editor's Note—The "Employee Consent Form" And The "Consent And Release" Form Can
Be Found On File In The City Offices.

All applicants whom the City of Webb City intends to employ will be tested
for controlled substances prior to the commencement of City employment.
Any such job offer shall be deemed conditional upon the successful
A. Definition. As used in this Article, the following terms shall have these
prescribed meanings:
ILLEGAL DRUG — Any drug:
1. Which is not legally obtainable,
2. Which is legally obtainable but has not been legally obtained, or
Non-prescribed controlled drugs.
In addition, "illegal drug" means prescribed drugs not being
used in prescribed manner.
3.
B. Any employee involved in any of the following activities at any time

work shift, whether or not on City business, premises or property, is a
violation of City policy and subject to disciplinary action:
1. Bringing illegal drugs onto City property or premises.
2. Having possession of or having a specific level of concentration
amount of illegal drugs or alcohol in employee's body during

alleged to have occurred within the course and scope of employment.
Employees may be asked to submit to medical examination and/or
submit to urine, saliva, breath and blood testing for illegal drugs or
alcohol within the body of the employee following an accident or injury.
Any information obtained through such examinations may be retained
by the City and is property of the City.

Section 125.080. Reasonable Suspicion. [Ord. No. 7052 §§1—2,
1-27-2003]
Current employees may be asked to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test if
cause exists to indicate that their health or ability to perform work may be
impaired. Although reasonable suspicion testing does not require certainty,
mere "hunches" are not sufficient to meet this standard. Therefore, the City
Administrator will only conduct a reasonable suspicion test after careful
consideration and approval.
Section 125.090. Drug Testing Procedures. [Ord. No. 7052 §§1—2,
1-27-2003]
A. An incident occurring while on City business that results in any one (1)

2. Damage to City property; or
3. A motor vehicle accident involving the towing of a vehicle from the
accident scene or the City-employed driver being issued a citation
for a moving violation;
will be subject to illegal drug and/or alcohol testing. Alcohol
tests will be conducted within two (2) hours of the incident
and controlled substances within thirty-two (32) hours. Failure
to report any accident which meets the post-accident testing
criteria is in violation of City policy and subject to disciplinary
action. Employees testing positive, under State law, may be
ineligible or receive a fifteen percent (15%) reduction of
Workers' Compensation benefits.
A. The drug test will be performed from urine specimens collected at a
qualified collection site. For all post-accident and reasonable cause
situations to determine substance levels, a blood test or evidential
breath test will be performed at the collection site. The collection site
will take the necessary steps to avoid any dilution or alteration of urine
specimens. Proper handling of the specimens will be maintained so that
the specimen results can be traced to the proper individual. A secure,
written chain-of-custody process will be implemented from the time of
the collection of the specimen until the specimen is disposed of or
secured in frozen long-term storage. The specimen will be analyzed by a
NIDA-certified, professional laboratory for the following controlled
substances with specific concentration levels greater than the
following:
Section

Amphetamines 1,000 ng/ml
Opiates 2,000 ng/ml
B. In addition to the above controlled substances, breath test or blood test
will be conducted to determine the presence of alcohol for a
concentration level greater than four-hundredths (.040).
C. Any employee who is tested positive will have the right, upon request,
to see the results of his/her test. The City will notify employees whose
tests are confirmed positive. If the test is a result of a post-accident
situation requiring medical care, the City's Workers' Compensation
insurance carrier will be notified of the results.

B. The selection of safety-sensitive employees for random testing shall be
conducted by a third (3rd) party in accordance with a scientific valid

conditions set forth in Section VII of this policy. Employees
transferring into a position requiring drug testing who test
positive for drugs do have the right to have their sample
retested. Employees who fail a drug test will not be hired for
the position requiring testing.
e. An employee who transfers from one position covered by this
policy to another covered by this policy does not require preemployment
testing. Employees working in a position covered
by this policy on the effective date, and continuing to work in a
covered position, do not require a pre-employment test.
2. Random testing.
a. All employees working in a position covered by this policy are
subject to unannounced testing based on random selection.
This includes temporary employees performing work in a
covered position.

prior to or after performing a safety-sensitive function.
f. Once an employee is notified of the requirement to take a
random alcohol and/or controlled substance test, the employee
must proceed to the test site immediately.
3. Reasonable cause testing.
a. Employees will be tested when there is reasonable cause to
believe that an employee covered by this policy is using a
controlled substance or alcohol as prohibited by Subpart B of
the regulation.
b. Conduct by employees constituting reasonable suspicion must
be based on the specific, contemporaneous, articulable
observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or
body odors of the employee. For controlled substances the
observation may include the indications of the chronic and
withdrawal effects of controlled substances. This conduct must
be witnessed by, and the decision to administer a reasonable
cause test made by, a supervisor or company official who has
had a minimum of sixty (60) minutes of training on alcohol and
sixty (60) minutes of training on controlled substance use.
c. Reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol is authorized only if
the observation, as described above, is made during, just
before, or just after the employee has been, will be, or was
performing a safety-sensitive function.
d. A reasonable suspicion test for alcohol must be conducted
within two (2) hours after the employee was notified. If the test
is not conducted within two (2) hours, a written record stating
the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered
must be completed. If the test is not administered within eight
(8) hours following the notification, attempts to administer an
alcohol test will be ceased and reasons documented for not
administering the test.

4. Post-accident testing.
NOTE: Nothing in this policy shall be construed as to require the
delay of necessary medical attention for injured persons following
an accident or to prohibit an employee from obtaining necessary
emergency medical care.
a. As soon as practicable following an accident involving a
commercial motor vehicle, tests for alcohol and controlled
substances shall be administered for each surviving driver
who:
(1) Was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to
the vehicle, if the accident involved the loss of human life;
or
(2) Receives a citation under State or local law for a moving
traffic violation arising from the accident.
b. An alcohol test must take place within two (2) hours following
the accident. If the test is not conducted within two (2) hours, a
written record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not
promptly administered must be completed. If the test is not
administered within eight (8) hours following the accident,
attempts to administer an alcohol test will be ceased and
reasons documented for not administering the test.
c. An employee subject to alcohol testing shall not use alcohol for
eight (8) hours following an accident, or until he/she undergoes
a post-accident alcohol test. The employee must remain readily
available for testing during the eight (8) hours following an
accident, or he/she will be considered as refusing to submit to
testing.

within thirty-two (32) hours after the accident, attempts to
administer the test will be ceased and reasons documented for
not administering the test.
e. The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol, or a
urine test for the use of controlled substances, conducted by
Federal, State or local officials having independent authority
for the test, will be considered to meet the requirements of this
Section.
5. Return-to-duty testing. Before an employee returns to duty
requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function, after
engaging in prohibited conduct regarding alcohol misused and/or
controlled substance use, the employee will be tested for alcohol
and/or controlled substances. In order to return to duty, an
employee must test negative for controlled substances and have a
breath alcohol concentration of less than two-hundredths (0.02).

1. The Medical Review Officer (MRO) for this policy would be the
screening officer currently providing screening services for the
City.
2. The following is a listing of the MRO's specific responsibilities. For
additional details of responsibilities see the United States
Department of Health and Human Services (DHH) Medical Review
Officer Manual.
a. Receive all results from laboratory.
b. Request, if needed, a quantitative description of test results.
c. Receive a certified copy of the original chain of custody.
d. Review and interpret positive test results.
e. Inform the tested individual and provide test results for
positive test.
f. Conduct a medical interview with the tested employee when
results are positive. If, after making all reasonable efforts and
documenting them, the MRO is unable to reach the employee
directly, the MRO shall contact the designated management
official who shall direct the employee to contact the MRO as
soon as possible. If it becomes necessary to reach the
employee through the designated management official, the
designated management official shall employ procedures that
will ensure to the maximum extent practical, that the
requirement that the employee's contact with the MRO is held
in confidence. If the designated employee representative has
successfully made and documented a contact with the
employee and has instructed the employee to contact the MRO
and more than five (5) days have passed since the date the
employee was successfully contacted by the designated
employee representative, or, if after making all reasonable
efforts, the designated management official is unable to
contact the employee, the employer may place the employee on
temporary medical unqualified status or medical leave and the
MRO may verify a test is positive without having
communicated directly with the employee about the test. If
later the employee presents to the MRO information
documenting that serious illness, injury or other circumstances
unavoidably prevented the employee from timely contacting
the MRO, on the basis of such information, may reopen the
verification allowing the employee to present information
concerning a legitimate explanation for the confirmed positive
test. If the MRO concludes there is a legitimate explanation,
the MRO declares the test to be negative. The MRO may also
verify a test is positive without having communicated directly
with the employee if the employee declines the opportunity to
discuss the test.
Section
125.210
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
125.210
100:87
g. Reviews the individual's medical history or any other relevant
biomedical factors to determine if a positive result is from
legally prescribed medicine.
h. Verify that laboratory assessment is correct.
i. Give the individual an opportunity to discuss test results.
j. Report to operator that result is negative where a legitimate
medical reason is found for a confirmed positive test result.
k. Order a reanalysis of the remaining portion of the sample from
a second (2nd) certified laboratory, if so requested by the
tested employee, within seventy-two (72) hours of the
employee being notified of a positive test.
l. Consult with others if a question of accuracy arises.
m. Consult with laboratory officials.
n. Not receive urinalysis results that do not comply with the
mandatory guidelines.
o. Not declare positive an opiate-positive urine sample without
"clinical evidence".
p. Determine whether a result is scientifically insufficient.
q. Determine whether a result is consistent with legal drug use.
r. Forward results of verified positive tests to Manager of
Employee Relations.
s. Maintain the required records to administer this program.
t. If an employee who has tested positive completes
rehabilitation, the MRO can recommend return to work and
the MRO will schedule return-to-duty testing. Testing will be
on an unannounced basis—daily, weekly, monthly or longer—at
the discretion of the MRO.
u. The MRO shall not disclose to any third (3rd) party medical
information provided by the employee as part of the testing
verification process unless an applicable DOT regulation
permits such disclosure; if, in the MRO's reasonable medical
judgment, the information could result in the employee being
determined to be medically unqualified under an applicable
DOT agency rule; or, in the MRO's reasonable medical
judgment, in a situation in which there is no DOT agency rule
establishing physical qualification standards applicable to the
employee, the information indicates that continued
performance by the employee of his/her safety-sensitive
function could pose a significant risk. Before obtaining medical
information from the employee as part of this verification

checks which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons
or warrant contains information of the ten-day period during which the
instrument may be paid and that payment of the instrument within such
ten-day period will result in dismissal of the charges. The requirement
of notice shall also be satisfied for written communications which are

may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of persons or to
the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply
with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4
or waters of the United States or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge.
1. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this Chapter may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The City will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition
the City for a reconsideration and hearing.
2. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section without the prior
written approval of the City.
A. Applicability. This Section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.

Stormwater Pollutants By The Use of Best Management Practices.
[Ord. No. 09-7363 §1, 11-24-2009]
The City will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for
any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the
U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural
BMP. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by State and Federal law.
3. The City shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the City, to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
4. The City has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.

calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the City
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
6. Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
Chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the City reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this Chapter.
7. If the City has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged and he/she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
Chapter or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling programs designed to verify
compliance with this Chapter or any order issued hereunder or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the City may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.

mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a
hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear
of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by such light or
device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded
that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front
and rear when the distance from the center of the top of the
steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load
exceeds twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the rear limit of the body or

in the process of loading or unloading students upon a street or
highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices,
in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to
communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or
unloading. A public school district has the authority pursuant to Section
304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as
to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic; nor
shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is
upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a
speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different
roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway
containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a
loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or

Miscellaneous Provisions
Section 390.140. Financial Responsibility Required.
A. No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or required to be
registered in this State shall operate the vehicle, or authorize any other
person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain registration of a
motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon
the streets or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the
financial responsibility as required in this Section which conforms to
the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the
owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such person
has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the
other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this
Subsection if he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor
vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall
mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in
any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury
to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident and in the
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
C. Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
1. A current insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle
insurer or by the Director of Revenue of the State of Missouri for
self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy, a motor
vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the
name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the
named insured, the policy number, the effective dates of the policy
and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five
(5) digits of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if
the insurance policy covers five (5) or more motor vehicles shall be
satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
2. A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit
according to Section 303.240, RSMo.
3. A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.

GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
390.140
100:427
Section 390.150. Display of False Evidence of Insurance — Penalty
— Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer
knowing there is no valid liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle
as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the evidence of insurance is
illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance.
If the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator
for displaying invalid evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the
evidence for presentation in court. Any person convicted of violating this
Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.
No person shall alter an invalid insurance card to make it appear valid. No
person knowingly shall make, sell or otherwise make available an invalid or
counterfeit insurance card. Any person who violates this Section is guilty of
an ordinance violation.
D. Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the
insured motor vehicle or by the operator of the motor vehicle if the
proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator rather
than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall
exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the
officer's or inspector's duties.
E. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the
operator demonstrates to the court that he/she met the financial
responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at the time the
Peace Officer wrote the citation.
F. Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of
an ordinance violation and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished
by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00) for each and every violation.

ARTICLE IV
Flood Plain Management
Section 405.360. Flood Plain Management Ordinances. [Ord. No.
6924 §§1—3(9-40), 2-22-1999]
This Article is intended to comply with the land management criteria as set
forth in part 1910 of the National Flood Insurance Program, to be known
as the Flood Plain Management Ordinance, and shall become effective upon
the date the City Council adopts the regular Flood Insurance Program.
Section 405.370. Statutory Authority, Findings of Facts and
Purposes. [Ord. No. 6924 §§1—3(9-41), 2-22-1999; Ord. No. 7213
§1(9-41), 2-27-2006]
A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in
Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt flood plain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore
the City of Webb City, Missouri, ordains as follows.
B. Findings Of Facts.
1. The special flood hazard areas of Webb City, Missouri are subject to
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by:
a. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated flood
plain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
b. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
3. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this Article
uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards,
which consist of a series of interrelated steps:
a. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors
as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated,
and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this
Article is representative of large floods which are
characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this Article. It is in the general
order of a flood which could be expected to have a one-percent
chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the
Section
405.360
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
405.370
100:527
Section 405.380. General Provisions. [Ord. No. 6924 §§1—3(9-42),
2-22-1999; Ord. No. 7213 §1(9-42), 2-27-2006]
Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS and illustrative
materials for Jasper County dated November 2, 2012, as
amended, and any future revisions thereto; [Ord. No. 12-016
§1, 9-24-2012]
b. Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and
over-bank areas to convey the regulatory flood;
c. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood
without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any
point;
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted which would cause any increase in
flood height;
e. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the
floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by
the base flood.
C. Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, to minimize those losses
described in Subsection (B) of this Section, to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Plain
Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 59.22(a)(3), and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by
applying the provisions of this Article to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses, which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or cause undue increases in flood heights
or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities,
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the
time of initial construction;
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.
A. Lands To Which This Zoning Regulation Applies. This Article shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Webb City identified as
numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Jasper County, Missouri on map panels
29097C0161E, 29097C0162E, 29097C0163E, 29097C0164E,
29097C0276E, and 29097C0277E, dated November 2, 2012, as
amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this
Article, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance
of a floodplain development permit, granted by the City Council or its
Section

as the City Council or the designated representative may reasonably
impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare and
health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in
section 405.400. [Ord. No. 12-016 §2, 9-24-2012]
B. Flood Plain Administrator. The Community Development Director is
hereby designated as the Flood Plain Administrator under this Article.
C. Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard
areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this
Article and other applicable regulations.
D. Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Article to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this Article imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this Article shall prevail.
E. Interpretation. In their interpretations and application, the provisions
of this Article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the City Council and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
F. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory

1. Require new construction or substantial improvements of
residential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the level of the 100-year flood.
2. Require new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures to have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the level of the 100-year flood, utility and
sanitary facilities to be floodproofed so that below such a level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the Building Inspector as set
forth in Section 405.380.
3. Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than abasement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net
area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of
all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry
and exit of floodwaters.
C. Within AH Zones adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures.
D. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist floatation, collapse or
lateral movement. Manufactured homes must be anchored in
accordance with local Building Codes or FEMA guidelines. In the event
that over-the-top frame ties to ground anchors are used, the following
specific requirements (or their equivalent) shall be met:
1. Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four (4) corners of the
manufactured home, with two (2) additional ties per side at
intermediate locations and manufactured homes less than fifty (50)
feet long requiring one (1) additional tie per side;
2. Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five (5)
additional ties per side at intermediate points and manufactured
homes less than fifty (50) feet long requiring four (4) additional ties
per side;

3. All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a
force of four thousand eight hundred (4,800) pounds; and
4. Any additions to the manufactured home be similarly anchored.
E. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the community's FIRM be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or
above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the
provisions of Section 405.420.
F. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section
405.380 are areas designed as AO Zones. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3)
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions apply within AO Zones:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the level of the
100-year flood.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
a. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the level of the
100-year flood.
b. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any
space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification
shall be provided to the Building Inspector as set forth in
Section 405.390.
3. Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be
required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures.
A. Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not obstructing
flood flows shall be permitted within the Floodway District to the extent
that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance. All encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
developments, must be prohibited unless certification by a professional

registered engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during
occurrence of the base flood discharge. No uses shall increase the
flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation. These uses are subject
to the standards of Sections 405.410 and 405.420. The following are
recommended uses for the Floodway District.
1. Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries and
forestry.
2. Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas.
3. Non-residential areas such as loading areas, parking and airport
landing strips.
4. Public and private recreational uses such as golf courses, archery
ranges, picnic grounds, parks, wildlife and nature preserves.
5. In Zone A unnumbered, obtain, review and reasonably utilize any

Section 405.410 in meeting the standards of this Section.
A. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances.
B. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the Building Inspector in the enforcement or
administration of this flood plain management zoning regulation.
C. Any person, or any neighborhood organization defined by Section
32.105, RSMo., aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment or
any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court of Jasper
County as provided in Section 89.110, RSMo., as amended.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical evaluation, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other Sections of this zoning regulation and the following:
1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
Section
405.430
GENERAL PROVISIONS Section
405.440
100:535
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
6. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for emergency
vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and
streets and bridges.
E. Variances may be granted under the following conditions:
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre
or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
(E)(2)—(E)(6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical jurisdiction
required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make
such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made
and to that end shall have all the powers of the Building Official from
whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four (4) members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision or determination of the Building Inspector or official or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required
to pass under any such ordinance or to effect any variation in such
ordinance.
A. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved, or by any neighborhood organization as defined in Section
32.105, RSMo., representing such person, or by any officer,
department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the
Building Official. Such appeal shall be taken within ten (10) days by
filing with the official from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board
of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. A fee in
the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall accompany such notice of
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the actions appealed from, unless the official from whom
the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice
of appeal shall have been filed with him/her that by reason of facts
Section
405.480
WEBB CITY CODE Section
405.490
100:540
stated in the certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause
immediate peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on application or
notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause
shown. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a time for the hearing of the
appeal within thirty (30) days following receipt of same, give public
notice thereof by publication in a local newspaper of general circulation
in the City not less than five (5) nor more than fifteen (15) days prior
to the date of said hearing. In addition, the Building Official shall post
notice of said hearing and the reasons therefore by placing a sign on the
subject premises. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or
by agent or by attorney.
B. The Board of Adjustment shall render decisions under this Section only
on appeals from an action of the Building Official. The Board shall take
action only when it has determined that a permit has been incorrectly
issued or denied or when it has determined that the Code has been
incorrectly interpreted or when the appellant proves undue and
unnecessary hardship due to a provision or provisions herein contained
as applied by the Building Official to a specific lot or tract. In case an
unnecessary or undue hardship, due to peculiar characteristics of a
specific lot or tract, is proven, the Board may issue a variance signed by
the Chairman and setting out any conditions to be met. A copy of the
variance shall be sent to the Code Enforcement Officer who shall issue a
building permit setting out the terms of the variance. In no case shall
the Board of Adjustment issue a variance or an order permitting a use
to be placed in a district in which it is not permitted in this Code, except
on appeal of a decision by the Code Enforcement Officer or as permitted
by Section 405.480(A)(2). In no case shall the Board decide an appeal
from an action of the City Council or Zoning and Planning Commission.
The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be
necessary to effect a decision. In all cases, the spirit and intent of this
Chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done.
C. Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of
the Board of Adjustment, or any neighborhood organization as defined
in Section 32.105, RSMo., representing such person, or any officer,
department, board or bureau of the City may present to the Circuit
Court a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or part, specifying the ground of the illegality. Such petition
must be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of
the decision of the Board in the office of the City Clerk, and thereafter
proceedings shall be had thereon as provided by Sections 89.010 to

received and reviewed the report of the HPC.
A. In considering an application for a building or demolition permit or for a
certificate of appropriateness, the HPC shall be guided in principle by
the Secretary of the Interior's standards, as follows, in addition to any
design guidelines in the ordinance designating the landmark or historic
district. Applications, standards for review and design guidelines shall

preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.

acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained
and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property
shall be preserved.

Cross-Connection Control
Section 705.040. City Water Supply Cross-Connection Control —
General Policy. [CC 1989 §6-23; Ord. No. 6760 §4, 10-24-1994]
Section 705.050. Definitions. [CC 1989 §6-24]
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement
of the cross-connection control ordinance:
A. The purpose of City water supply cross-connection control is:
1. To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by containing within the consumer's internal distribution
system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water supply system.
2. To promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public
or consumer's potable water system and non-potable water
systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial-process systems.
3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
B. Section 705.040 through and including Section 705.100 shall be known
as the "Cross-Connection Control Policy". The Cross-Connection
Control Policy shall apply to all premises served by the public potable
water system of the City.
C. The Cross-Connection Control Policy will be reasonably interpreted by
the City Council of the City. It is the City's intent to recognize the
varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of
protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard. The Public
Works Board shall be primarily responsible for protection of the public
potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due
to backflow or contaminants or pollutants through the water service
connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement
and maintain the program to control cross-connections. The City and
consumer are jointly responsible for preventing contamination of the
water system. If, in the judgment of the City or its authorized
representative, cross-connection protection is required through either
piping modification or installation of an approved backflow prevention
device, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall
immediately comply by providing the required protection at his/her own
expense; and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to
provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing
water service to the premises until such protection has been provided.

Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which
the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas
pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.
K. No statement contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to
payment, therefore, by the industrial concern.

shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the City for review and shall be acceptable to the City
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent meeting Federal
categorical pretreatment standards. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the City prior to the user's initiation of the changes.

§6-134; Ord. No. 6630 §1, 11-11-1991]
Monies which have been transferred from other sources to meet
temporary shortages in the Operation, Maintenance and
Replacement Fund shall be returned to their respective accounts
upon appropriate adjustments of the user charge rates for
operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rate
shall be adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned
to their respective accounts within the fiscal year following the
fiscal year in which the monies were borrowed.
A. Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on his/
her use of the treatment works as determined by water meters
acceptable to the City.
B. For residential contributors, monthly user charges will be based on
average monthly water usage during the months of January, February
and March. If a residential contributor has not established a January,
February and March average, his/her monthly user charge shall be the
median charge of all other residential contributors. For industrial and
commercial contributors, user charges shall be based on water used
during the current month. If a commercial or industrial contributor has
a consumptive use of water, or in some other manner uses water which
is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user charge for
that contributor may be based on a wastewater meter or a separate
water meter installed and maintained at the contributor's expense and
in a manner acceptable to the City.
C. Users living within the corporate limits of the City shall pay a user
charge rate for operation and maintenance, including replacement, of
an amount set forth in Appendix A (on file in the City offices) per one
hundred (100) cubic feet of water used, as determined in Subsection
(B).
D. For those users who contribute wastewater, the strength of which is
greater than normal domestic sewage, a surcharge in addition to the
normal user charge will be collected. The surcharge for operation and
maintenance including replacement is:
1. An amount set forth in Appendix A to this Section (on file in the City
offices) per pound BOD in excess of three hundred (300) mg/l.
2. An amount set forth in Appendix A to this Section (on file in the City
offices) per pound SS in excess of three hundred fifty (350) mg/l.
E. Any user who discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase
in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the City's
treatment works, or any user who discharges any substance which
singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable
increases in the cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the

treatment works shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to
each user shall be as determined by the responsible plant operating
personnel and approved by the City Council.
F. The user charge rates established in this Section apply to all users of
the City's treatment works, regardless of their location.
G. The City is hereby given the authority to adjust individual sewer user
fees, by vote of a majority of a quorum at any meeting of the Council, in
the following circumstances subject to the specific limitations set forth
below:
1. The base for the monthly user charge for a new resident may be
increased (on the Board's own motion) or decreased (at the request
of a new resident) after six (6) months of residency at one (1)
address, to be based on the average monthly water usage for the
six (6) months immediately preceding the adjustment. This is to be
a onetime adjustment for new residents only. New residents are
those adult residents of the City of Webb City who have resided in
Webb City for twelve (12) or fewer consecutive months immediately
preceding any request or motion for adjustment of the base.
2. A resident who has resided in the City of Webb City for more than
twelve (12) consecutive months prior to making application may
obtain a downward adjustment of his/her base. Such adjusted base
will be computed based on the average monthly water usage by the
resident's household during the three (3) full calendar months
immediately preceding the resident's application. Such an
adjustment is only available if it will result in a decrease by ten
percent (10%) or more of the resident's monthly user charge. No
resident may obtain an adjustment under this Subparagraph more
often than once every twelve (12) months.
3. On motion of the Board, the base for the monthly user charge to a
residential user may be increased if the residential user's average
monthly water usage during the six (6) consecutive calendar
months immediately preceding the motion exceeds the average
monthly water usage used to establish the user's current base by
twenty-five percent (25%) or more. An adjusted base under this
Subparagraph shall be calculated using the average monthly water
usage by the residential user for the three (3) consecutive calendar
months immediately preceding the motion for adjustment.
A. All users shall be billed monthly. Billings for any particular month shall
be made within thirty (30) days after the end of that month. Payments
are due when the billings are made. Any payment not received within
thirty (30) days after the billing is made shall be delinquent.

Upon recommendation of the City Administration concerning the costs
and expenses associated with sanitary sewage collection, treatment and
disposal; and the user charge rates necessary to recover those costs and
expenses. The City of Webb City, Missouri, has determined that it is
necessary to increase the monthly charge assessed residential users, as
well as industrial and commercial users, by the City for sanitary sewage
collection, treatment and disposal. The rates charged by the City of Webb
City, Missouri for sewage collection treatment and disposal are hereby
established as set forth below:
Base Rate of twenty-eight dollars ($28.00) per each account.
For Residential Customers the rate will be established at the April billing
based on the average use of the previous three (3) months (January,
February and March) and thence carried throughout the remainder of the
year.
All other customer accounts will be charged based on the water usage each
month. Treatment costs will be $.0045 per gallon usage. This applies to all
accounts.
B. A late payment penalty of ten percent (10%) of the user charge bill will
be added to each delinquent bill for each thirty (30) days of
delinquency. When any bill is thirty (30) days in default, rendition of
water and/or sewer service to such premises shall be discontinued until
such bill is paid following due notice and opportunity for hearing.
A. The City will review the user charge system at least once every
calendar year and revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that
the system generates adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation
and maintenance, including replacement, and that the system
continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and
maintenance, including replacement costs, among users and user
classes.
B. The City will notify each user at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill, of the rate being charged for operation and maintenance,
including replacement of the treatment works.
