Council; provided, however, that warrants may be issued for the payment of

but the total amount of such warrants issued between any successive regular
meetings of the Council shall not exceed an amount as the Council may from time
to time establish.
   All liquidated accounts and demands against the City shall be received and

sealed proposals therefor.
Sec. 108  Contracts or purchases in excess of $2,500; sealed proposals
required.
No contract shall be entered into by the City for the making of any public

Article 6 Bonds
Sec. 111  Issuance and limitations of bonds.
The City Council may borrow money on the credit of the City and issue the bonds
of the City therefor, for any purpose within the scope of its powers; provided
that the net bonded indebtedness incurred for all public purposes shall not at
any time exceed ten percentum of the assessed valuation of all real and
personal property in the City; provided, further, that in case of fire, flood
or other calamity the legislative body may borrow for the relief of the
inhabitants of the City and for the preservation of Municipal property, a sum
not to exceed three-eighths of one percentum of the assessed valuation of all
real and personal property in the City, due in not more than five years, even
if such loan would cause the indebtedness of the City to exceed the said ten
percentum limitation; and provided, further, that in computing the net bonded
indebtedness for the purposes hereof there shall not be included bonds issued
in anticipation of the payment of special assessments even though they are also
a general obligation of the City, mortgage bonds which are secured only by a
mortgage on the property or franchise of a public utility and any other bonds
which are excluded therefrom by law; and the resources of any debt retirement
or sinking fund pledged for the retirement of any outstanding bonds which are
included within said ten percentum limitation, shall be deducted from the
amount of such bonded indebtedness.
Sec. 112  Issuance and limitations of special assessment bonds.
The Council may borrow money and issue the bonds of the City therefor in
anticipation of the payment of special assessments made for defraying the cost
of public improvements, after the special assessment roll shall have been
confirmed. Such bonds may be an obligation of the special assessment district
only or may be both an obligation of the special assessment district and a
general obligation of the City. Such bonds shall not exceed the amount of the
special assessments in anticipation of the collection of which they are issued,
and shall bear such interests as the Council may determine, not exceeding six
percentum per annum. Collections on special assessments pledged for the payment
of bonds shall be set aside in a special fund for the payment of such bonds. In
no event shall such bonds be sold or otherwise disposed of at less than their
par value. The issuance of special assessment bonds shall be governed by the
provisions of the general laws of the State applicable thereto. Bonds may be
issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments levied in
respect to two or more public improvements, but no special assessment district
shall be compelled to pay the obligation of any other special assessment
district.
Sec. 113  Payment of special assessment bonds.
   Whenever any portion of the cost of a public improvement shall be assumed by
or charged to the City at large and the balance of such cost assessed to the
property benefited, if the Council shall provide for the payment of the City's
portion of such cost in installments, then in such case bonds may be issued in
anticipation of the payment of the amount assessed to the City-at-large, the
same as they may be issued in anticipation of the payment of the amount
assessed to the benefited property. In such case, there shall be appropriated
each year an amount sufficient to pay the bonds issued in anticipation of the
collection of assessments against the City, when the same fall due. Nothing in
this section contained shall be construed to require the financing of the
City's portion of the cost of any improvement in the manner herein specified.
It shall not be necessary to issue a separate series of bonds for the City's
portion of the cost of any such public improvement but such bonds may be
included as a part of a total issue against all special assessments, including
those against the City.
Sec. 114  Authority to issue obligations.
   The Council may also issue the following obligations of the City, to wit:
tax anticipation notes, revenue bonds, refunding bonds and any other
obligations authorized by law, subject to the provisions of such authorizing
law.
Sec. 115  Mortgage bonds for public utilities.
   When the City is authorized to acquire or operate any public utility as
defined in Section 23 of Article VIII of the Michigan Constitution, it may
issue mortgage bonds therefor beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness
prescribed by law; provided that such mortgage bonds issued beyond such limit
of bonded indebtedness shall not impose any liability upon the City but shall
be secured only upon the property and revenues of such public utility,
including a franchise stating the terms upon which, in case of foreclosure, the
purchaser may operate the same, which franchise shall in no case extend for a
longer period than twenty years from the date of the sale of such utility and
franchise on foreclosure. Such mortgage bonds shall be sold to yield not to
exceed six percentum per annum. In the event of the issuance of such mortgage
bonds there shall be created a sinking fund by setting aside such percentage of
the gross or net earnings of the public utility as may be deemed sufficient for
the payment of the mortgage bonds at maturity.
Sec. 116  Approval by electors required; exceptions.
   No bonds shall be issued unless approved by three-fifths of the electors
voting thereon at any general or special election; provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes
actually levied and uncollected or for which an appropriation has been made;
special assessment bonds, whether solely an obligation of the special
assessment district or both an obligation of the special assessment district
and a general obligation of the City; bonds for the City's portion of local
improvements; refunding bonds; emergency bonds, as defined in Act No. 279,
Public Acts of 1909, as amended; and any other bonds which by law are not
required to be approved by the electors.
Sec. 117  Signatures required; contents.
   Every bond issued by the City shall contain on its face a statement
specifying the object for which the same is issued. Bonds of the City shall be
signed by the Mayor and Clerk under the Seal of the City. The coupons
evidencing the interest upon said bonds shall be executed with the facsimile
signatures of the Mayor and the Clerk. A complete and detailed record of all
bonds shall be kept by the Clerk.
Sec. 118  Term bonds; sinking fund required.
   If term bonds be permitted in any case and such bonds be issued, then a
sinking fund shall be created for the payment of the same, which sinking fund
shall conform to all requirements of the State law.
Sec. 119  Compliance with State law.
   The issuance of bonds by the City shall be subject to the provisions of the
general laws of the State applicable thereto.
Article 7 Taxation
Sec. 120  Power to tax; limitation.
   The City shall have the power to assess taxes and to lay and collect rents,
tolls and excises. The annual general ad valorem tax levy for Municipal
purposes shall not exceed 12.5 mills of the assessed value of all real and
personal property in the City.
Sec. 121  Subjects of taxation; levy and collection.
   (a)   The subjects of ad valorem taxation for Municipal purposes shall be
the same as for State, County and school purposes under the general law.

shall be levied and collected in the manner provided by law.
Sec. 122  Exemptions prohibited; exception.

or contract to which the City shall be a party. No exemptions from taxation
shall be allowed, except such as are expressly required or permitted by law.
Sec. 123  Tax day.
   Subject to the exceptions provided or permitted by law, the taxable status
of persons and property shall be determined as of the first day of January or
such other date as may subsequently be required by law, which shall be deemed
the tax day. Values on the assessment roll shall be determined according to the
facts existing on the tax day for the year for which such roll is made and no
change of the status or of the location of any such property after that day
shall be considered by the Assessor or the Board of Review.
Sec. 124  Evasion.
   If the Treasurer finds or reasonably believes that any person who is, or may
be, liable for taxes upon personal property, the taxable situs of which was in
the City on tax day, intends to depart from the City; or to remove therefrom
personal property which is, or may be, liable for taxation; or to conceal
himself or his property; or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to
render, wholly or partly ineffectual the proceedings to collect such tax,
unless proceedings therefor be brought without delay, he shall proceed to
collect the same as a jeopardy assessment in the manner provided by law.
Sec. 125  Preparation of assessment roll by City Assessor.
   Prior to the third Monday in March in each year, or such other date as may
subsequently be required by law, the Assessor shall prepare and certify an
assessment roll of all property in the City. Such roll shall be prepared in
accordance with law and may be divided into volumes, which shall be identified
by the Assessor, for purposes of convenience in handling the assessment roll
and for locating properties assessed therein. The attachment of any certificate
or warrant required by this chapter (article) to any volume of the roll, either
as an assessment roll or as a tax roll, shall constitute the attachment thereof
to the entire roll, provided the several volumes are identified in such
certificate or warrant. Values of property set forth on the assessment roll
shall be determined according to recognized methods of systematic assessment.
Sec. 126  Board of Review; composition; appointment; term; compensation.
   (a)   A Board of Review is hereby created, composed of three members who
shall be registered electors of the City who have the qualifications for
holding office in the City, as set forth in Section 80 of this Charter, and who
are owners of property assessed for taxation in the City. The members of the
Board of Review shall be appointed on the basis of their knowledge and
experience in property valuation.
   (b)   The members of the Board of Review shall be appointed by the Mayor,
subject to the confirmation of the Council. The first members shall be
appointed during the month of January, 1959 for terms expiring on July 1, 1960,

confirmed by the Council in the month of May of each year, for a term of three
years, commencing on the following July 1st.
   (c)   The Board shall, annually, on the first day of the meeting, select one
of its members chairman and one of its members clerk for the ensuing year. The
Assessor shall be entitled to be heard at its sessions, but shall have no vote
on any proposition or question before the Board.
   (d)   The members of the Board of Review shall be paid such compensation as
the Council may determine.
Sec. 127  Board of Review; powers and duties.
   For the purpose of revising and correcting assessments, the Board of Review
shall have the same powers and perform like duties, in all respects, as are, by
law, conferred upon and required of boards of review in townships, except as
otherwise provided in this Charter. At the time, and in the manner provided in
the following section, it shall hear the complaints of all persons considering
themselves aggrieved by assessments. If it shall appear that any person or
property has been wrongfully assessed or omitted from the roll, the Board shall
correct the roll in such manner as it deems just. Except as otherwise provided
by law, no person other than the Board of Review shall authorize any change
upon, or addition or correction to, the assessment roll. The clerk of the Board
of Review shall keep a permanent record of all proceedings of the Board and
enter therein all resolutions and decisions of the Board. Such record shall be
filed with the City Clerk on or before the 15th day of April following the
meeting of the Board of Review.
Sec. 128  Board of Review; meetings; quorum; testimony under oath.
   (a)   The Board of Review shall convene on the third Monday in March in each
year, or on such date as may subsequently be required by law for the meeting of
boards of review in cities, at such places as shall be designated by the
Council at its first regular meeting in February and shall sit for not less
than three calendar days; provided that, if the Council does not so designate a
place for the meeting of the Board of Review, it shall meet in the Council
Chamber. A majority of the members of the Board of Review shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of its business.
   (b)   The Board of Review may examine on oath any person appearing before it
respecting the assessment of property on the assessment roll. Any member of the
Board may administer such oath.
Sec. 129  Notice of meetings; publication required.
   Notice of the time and place of the meetings of the Board of Review shall be
published by the Assessor, in the official newspaper of the City, not less than
ten days prior to the first meeting thereof.
Sec. 130  Certification of assessment roll.
   After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
and not later than the Tuesday following the fourth Monday in March or such
other date as may subsequently be required by law, the majority of its members
shall sign a certificate to the effect that the same is the assessment roll of
the City for the year in which it has been prepared, as approved by the Board
of Review, which certificate, when attached to any volume of the roll, shall
constitute a conclusive presumption of the validity of the entire roll, as
provided in Section 125 of this Charter. Any copy of such roll, when so
certified, shall be equally valid as the original roll. The omission of such
certificate shall not affect the validity of such roll.
Sec. 131  Validity of assessment roll.
   Upon completion of the roll, and from and after midnight ending the last day
of the meeting of the Board of Review, it shall be the assessment roll of the
City for County, school and City taxes, and for other taxes on real and
personal property that may be authorized by law. It shall be presumed by all
courts and tribunals to be valid, and shall not be set aside, except for cause
set forth by law.
Sec. 132  Certification of appropriations by City Clerk.
   Within three days after the Council has made the appropriations for the
ensuing year, the Clerk shall certify to the Assessor the total amount which
the Council determines shall be raised by general ad valorem tax, together with
such other assessments and lawful charges and amounts which the Council
requires to be assessed, reassessed or charged upon the property and person
appearing upon such roll.
Sec. 133  Preparation of City tax roll by City Assessor.
   After the Board of Review has completed its review of the assessment roll,
the Assessor shall prepare a tax roll, or a combined assessment and tax roll,
to be known as the "City tax roll." Upon receiving the certification of the
several amounts to be raised, assessed and charged upon the City tax roll, as
provided in the preceding section, the Assessor shall proceed forthwith (1) to
spread the amounts of the general ad valorem tax according to and in proportion
to the several valuations set forth in said assessment roll, and (2) to place
other assessments and charges upon the roll as are required and authorized by
the Council. To avoid fractions in computations on any tax roll, the Assessor
may add to the amount of the several taxes to be raised not more than the
amount prescribed by law, which added amount, when collected, shall belong to
the City.
Sec. 134  Certification of City tax roll; delivery to Treasurer for collection.
   After spreading the taxes and placing other assessments and charges upon the
roll, the Assessor shall certify the tax roll, and annex his warrant thereto
directing and requiring the Treasurer to collect, prior to July first the same
year, from the several persons named in the roll the several sums mentioned
therein opposite their respective names as a tax or assessment, and granting to
and vesting in the Treasurer, for the purpose of collecting the taxes,
assessments and charges on such roll, all statutory powers and immunities
possessed by township treasurers for the collection of taxes; provided that
taxes and other lawful assessments and charges on any City tax roll which
remain unpaid on the first day of March may be transferred, together with any
collection fees or charges which have been added thereto, to the delinquent tax
roll to be collected thereon. The City tax roll shall be delivered to the
Treasurer on or before the first day of July.
(Apr. 7, 1969)
Sec. 135  Due date; lien.
   (a)   Except as provided in Section 124 of this Charter, such taxes shall be
due on the first day of July of each year, and, on that day, the taxes assessed
to the owners of personal property shall become a debt due to the City from the
persons to whom they are assessed, and the amounts assessed on any interest in
real property shall become a lien upon such real property, for such amounts and
for all interest and charges thereon.
   (b)   All personal property taxes shall be a first lien, prior, superior and
paramount on all the personal property of such persons so assessed. Such lien
shall take precedence over all other claims, encumbrances and liens, to the
extent provided by law, and shall continue until such taxes, interest and
charges are paid.
Sec. 136  Notice of due date.
   The Treasurer shall not be required to make personal demand for the payment
of taxes, but, upon receipt of the City tax roll by him, he shall forthwith
mail a tax statement to each person named in the tax roll and shall give notice
of the date upon which City taxes are due by publication in the official
newspaper of the City, which notice shall be sufficient demand for the payment
of all taxes assessed. Neither the failure on the part of any person to receive
the notice or the tax statement shall invalidate the taxes on the tax roll or
release any person or property assessed from the penalty provided in this
chapter (article) in case of non-payment.
Sec. 137  Collection fees for late payment.
   The taxes, charges and assessments on each City tax roll shall be due and
payable on the first day of July of the fiscal year in which levied. All such
taxes, charges and assessments which are paid on or before the fifteenth day of
August of such year shall be collected by the Treasurer without the addition of
any fee or charge for the collection thereof. There shall be added to all
taxes, charges and assessments on such tax roll which remain unpaid after the
said fifteenth day of August, a collection fee of one-half of one percent
during the month of August and an additional one-half of one percent per month
during each and every month or fraction of a month which shall elapse
thereafter before the payment of such taxes, charges or assessments is made,
until the last day of February next following the date that such taxes, charges
or assessments become due and payable. Upon all City taxes, charges and
assessments returned to the County Treasurer upon any delinquent tax roll, a
charge of three and one-half percent shall be added and the same shall be
collected by the County Treasurer in like manner as and together with the
taxes, charges and assessments so returned.
(Apr. 7, 1969)
Sec. 138  Failure to pay; remedies.
   If any person shall neglect or refuse to pay any tax on personal property
assessed to him, the Treasurer shall collect the same by seizing the personal
property of such person, to an amount sufficient to pay such tax, fees and
charges, wherever the same may be found in the State. No property shall be
exempt from such seizure. He may sell the property seized, to an amount
sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges, fees, penalties and interest, in
accordance with law. The Treasurer may, if otherwise unable to collect a tax on
personal property, sue the person to whom it is assessed, in accordance with
the powers granted to him by law.
Sec. 139  State, County and school taxes.
   For the purpose of assessing and collecting taxes for State, County and
school purposes, the City shall be considered the same as a township and all
provisions of law relative to the collection and accounting for such taxes and
the penalties and interest thereon shall apply. For the purpose of collecting
State, County and school taxes, the Treasurer shall perform the same duties and
have the same powers as township treasurers under State law.
Sec. 140  Acquisition of property for tax purposes.
   The City shall have power, insofar as the exercise thereof shall not
conflict with or contravene the provisions of law, to acquire such an interest
in any premises within the City, by purchase at any tax or other public sale,
or by direct purchase from, or negotiation with, the State of Michigan or the
fee owner, as may be necessary to assure to the City the collection of its
taxes, special assessments or charges which are levied against any lot or
parcel of real property or to protect the lien of the City therefor, and may
hold, lease or sell the same. Any such procedures exercised by the City to
assure the collection of its taxes or the protection of its tax or other liens
shall be deemed to be for a public purpose. The Council may adopt any ordinance
which may be necessary to make this section effective.
Sec. 141  Procedures for collection of delinquent taxes.
   All taxes and charges, together with fees, penalties and interest upon real
property on the tax roll, remaining uncollected by the Treasurer on the first
day of March following the date when the roll was received by him, shall be
subject to one of the following procedures:
   (a)   The real property against which such taxes and charges are assessed
shall be subject to disposition, sale and redemption for the enforcement and
collection of the tax lien against the same in the method and manner which may
be provided by ordinance. The Council may provide by ordinance for the sale of
real property for such unpaid taxes and charges, together with fees, penalties
and interest, by judicial sale on petition filed in behalf of the City.
   The above procedure shall not contravene any State statute pertaining.
   (b)   If no ordinance is in effect pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section, such taxes shall be returned to the County Treasurer, to the extent
and in the same manner and with like effect as provided by law for returns by
township treasurers of township and county taxes. Such returns shall include
all the additional assessments, charges, fees, penalties and interest
hereinbefore provided, which shall be added to the amount assessed in said tax
roll against each property or person. The taxes thus returned shall be
collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the County Treasurer
are collected in accordance with law, and shall be and remain a lien upon the
property against which they are assessed until paid.
(Apr. 7, 1969)
Sec. 142  Sale of City property for tax purposes.
   The Council shall pass an ordinance providing for the care, custody and
disposition of real property, or any interest therein, which it shall hereafter
acquire by reason of any action taken to protect the City's tax lien thereon.
Unless action is taken by the Council as provided and permitted in this
section, the owner of any interest therein, by fee, by title, as mortgagee or
as vendor or vendee under a land contract shall be given the right to purchase
the City's interest therein, upon payment to the City of the amount of money
which the City has invested therein in the form of unpaid taxes, special
assessments, charges, fees, penalties, interest and costs. After the lapse of
ninety days after the date that the City acquires title to any such property,
the Council may remove the same from the market by determining that such
property is needed for and should be devoted to public purpose, naming such
purpose, or may sell the same at a price which shall be not less than its
market value, as determined and certified to the Council by the Assessor.
Sec. 143  Reports by City Treasurer.
   At least two weeks before the date of sale of any real estate, upon which
the City has any claim, the Treasurer shall report to the Council a list of the
parcels of such real estate and the amount of the City's claims, together with
all fees, penalties and interest which have accumulated thereon or accrued
thereto.
Article 8 Special Assessments
Sec. 144  Authority; computation of cost.
   The Council shall have the power to determine that the whole or any part of
the cost of a public improvement shall be defrayed by special assessments upon
the especially benefited. The cost of all surveys and plans for a public
improvement and all expenses incident to the proceedings for the making of such
improvement and the special assessments therefor and for the issuance of bonds
in anticipation of such special assessments, shall be deemed to be a part of
the cost of the improvement. The cost of any improvement shall also include the
cost of acquiring any lands necessary therefor.
Sec. 145  Procedure for levy of assessments; hearings.
   When the Council shall propose to make any public improvement, any part of
the cost of which is to be defrayed by special assessment, it shall refer the
matter to the City Engineer who shall prepare or cause to be prepared plans
showing the improvement and the location thereof, and an estimate of the cost
thereof. Upon receipt of such plans and estimate, the Council shall order the
same to be filed with the City Clerk, and if it shall desire to proceed with
the improvement, it shall by resolution declare its intention to make such
public improvement and shall designate the special assessment district and what
part or portion of the cost of said improvement shall be made by special
assessment against the lots and parcels of land in said special assessment
district and what part, if any, shall be paid from the general funds of the
City. The Council shall also fix a time and place when it will meet and hear
any objections to such improvement and to the special assessment district, and
shall cause notice of such hearing to be given by publication thereof twice
prior to such hearing in the official newspaper circulating in the City, the
first publication to be at least one week prior to the time of such hearing.
Such notice shall state that the plans and estimates are on file with the City
Clerk and shall contain a description of the proposed assessment district. At
the time of such hearing, or any adjournment thereof, which may be without
further notice, the Council shall hear any objections to such improvement and
to the special assessment district, and may, without further notice, revise,
correct, amend or change the plans, estimate and/or district, provided that no
property shall be added to the district until notice be given as above provided
or by personal service upon the owners thereof, and a hearing afforded such
owners. The Council, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable number
of property owners to be assessed desire a public improvement to be made under
the provisions of this chapter (article), may request that a petition therefor
be presented to it, but in the event a petition be so filed, it shall be
advisory only and shall not be jurisdictional.
   If, at or prior to such meeting of the Council, the owners of more than
fifty percent of privately owned property to be assessed for any improvement,
or in case of paving or similar improvements, the owners of more than fifty
percent of frontage to be assessed for any such improvement, shall object in
writing to the proposed improvement, the assessment shall not be made without a
five-sevenths vote of the members of the Council.
Sec. 146  Preparation of assessment roll.
   After the hearing provided for in the preceding section (Sec. 145), if the
Council desires to proceed with such improvement, it shall, by resolution,
determine to make such improvement and shall approve said plans and estimate,
as originally presented or as revised, corrected, amended or changed. The
Council shall also direct the City Assessor to make a special assessment roll
in which shall be entered and described all lots and parcels of land to be
assessed, with the names of the respective owners thereof, if known, and the
amount to be assessed against each such lot or parcel of land, which amount
shall be such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the
lots and parcels of land in the special assessment district as the benefit to
such lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefits to all lots and parcels
of land in the special assessment district. There shall also be entered upon
said roll the amount which has been assessed to the City-at-large.
   When the City Assessor shall have completed the assessment roll, he shall
affix thereto a certificate stating that it was made pursuant to a resolution
of the Council of said City, adopted on a specific date, and that in making
such assessment roll, he has, according to his best judgment, conformed in all
respects to the directions contained in said resolution and to the Charter of
the City.
Sec. 147  Review of roll; hearing prior to confirmation.
   When any special assessment roll shall be reported by the Assessor to the
Council, the same shall be filed in the office of the Clerk. Before confirming
such assessment roll, the Council shall appoint a time and place when it will
meet and review the same, and hear any objections thereto, and shall cause
notice of such hearing and of the filing of such assessment roll to be
published twice prior to such hearing in the official newspaper circulating in
the City, the first publication to be at least one week prior to such hearing.
Such hearing may be adjourned without further notice. Any person objecting to
the assessment roll shall file his objections thereto in writing with the Clerk
before the close of such hearing or within such further time as the Council may
grant. After such hearing, the Council may confirm such special assessment roll
as reported to it by the Assessor, or may correct the same as to any matter
appearing therein in and confirm it as so corrected, or may refer it back to
the Assessor for revision, or may annul it and direct a new roll to be made.
   When a special assessment roll shall be confirmed, the Clerk shall endorse
thereon the date of the confirmation. After such confirmation, the special
assessment roll and all assessment therein shall be final and conclusive.
Sec. 148  Installment payments.
   Special assessments shall be payable in one installment or in such a number
of approximately equal annual installments not exceeding fifteen as the Council
may determine. The amount of each installment (if more than one) need not be
extended upon the special assessment roll until after confirmation. The first
installment of a special assessment shall be due at such time after
confirmation as the Council shall fix, and the several subsequent installments
shall be due at intervals of twelve months from the due date of the first
installment. All unpaid installments prior to their transfer to the City tax
roll, shall bear interest, payable annually, at a rate to be fixed by the
Council not exceeding six percent per annum, such interest to commence at such
time as shall be fixed by Council.
   The whole assessment against any lot or parcel of land may be paid to the
City Treasurer at any time in full with interest and penalties accrued to the
date of payment of the next installment.
   If any installment of a special assessment is not paid when due, then the
same shall be deemed to be delinquent and there shall be collected thereon, in
addition to interest, as above provided, a penalty at the rate of one-half of
one percent for each month or fraction thereof that the same remains unpaid
before being reported to the Council for reassessment upon the City tax roll.
The City's portion of the cost of any improvement may be divided into
installments the same as the assessments against lands in the district and in
such case the provisions of this chapter (article) relative to such
installments shall apply to the City installments insofar as they are
applicable.
(Nov. 5, 1968)
Sec. 149  Assessments as liens.
   All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including
any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall, from the date of confirmation
of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land
assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the
several lots and parcels of land. Such lien shall be of the same character and
effect as the lien created for City taxes and shall include accrued interest
and penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the Council vacating any
special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the
premises assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably
charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be
lawfully assessed thereon.
Sec. 150  Collection of assessments by City Treasurer.
   When any special assessment shall be confirmed, the Council shall direct the
assessments so made in the special assessment roll to be collected. The City
Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the City Treasurer said special assessment
roll to which he shall attach his warrant commanding the City Treasurer to
collect from each of the persons assessed in said roll the amount of money
assessed to and set opposite his name therein, and in case any such person
shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment, or any part thereof, upon demand
after the same has become due, then to levy and collect the same by distress
and sale of the goods and chattels of such person.
   Such warrant shall further require the City Treasurer on the first day of
March following the date when any such assessments, or any part thereof, have
become due, to submit to the Council, a sworn statement, setting forth the
names of the persons delinquent, if known, a description of the lots and
parcels of land upon which there are delinquent assessments and the amount of
such delinquency, including accrued interest and penalties computed to March
first of such year.
Sec. 151  Nonpayment; seizure and sale of property.
   Upon receiving such special assessment roll and warrant, the Treasurer shall
proceed to collect the several amounts assessed therein. If any person legally
obligated to pay said assessment shall neglect and refuse to pay his
assessment, upon demand, the Treasurer may seize or levy upon any personal
property belonging to such person, found within the City or elsewhere in the
State of Michigan, and sell the same at public auction, first giving six days
notice of the time and place of such sale by posting such notice in three
places most public in the city or township where such property may be found,
the proceeds of such sale or so much thereof as may be necessary for that
purpose shall be applied to the payment of the assessment and the costs and
expenses of such seizure and sale, and the surplus, shall be paid to the person
entitled thereto.
Sec. 152  Penalties; reassessments.
   In case the Treasurer, pursuant to the provisions of Section 150, shall
report as delinquent any assessment or part thereof, the Council shall certify
the same to the Assessor who shall reassess on the next annual City tax roll in
a column headed special assessments, the sum so delinquent with interest and
penalty to March first of such year and an additional penalty of five percent
of such total amount and when so reassessed upon such tax roll, shall be
collected in all respects as provided for the collection of City taxes, except
from and after the thirty-first day of July of the year of such reassessment
and until March first of the following year, there shall be added a penalty of
one percent for each month or fraction thereof that the same remains unpaid.
Unpaid special assessments reassessed upon a City tax roll shall be returned to
the County Treasurer for collection, at the same time and in the same manner as
City taxes.
Sec. 153  Action in assumpsit.
   In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor,
any delinquent special assessment together with interest and penalties may be
collected in an action of assumpsit in the name of the City against the person
assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If, in any such
action, it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities,
the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant, or upon the
premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory
proof that expense has been incurred by the City, which is a proper charge
against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the
amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.
Sec. 154  Subsequent division of land; apportionment of assessment.
   Should any lot or parcel of land be divided after a special assessment
thereon has been confirmed and before the collection thereof, the Council may
require the Assessor to apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several
parts of such lot or parcel of land. The report of such apportionment when
confirmed shall be conclusive upon all parties, provided that before such
confirmation, notice of hearing shall be given to all the interested parties,
either by personal service or by publication as above provided in case of an
original assessment roll.
Sec. 155  Insufficiency or excess.
   Should the assessments in any special assessment roll prove insufficient for
any reason, including the noncollection thereof, to pay for the improvement for
which they were made or to pay the principal and interest on the bonds issued
in anticipation of the collection of such assessments, then the Council shall
make additional pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency, but the total
amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of
the benefits received from the improvement.
   Should the amount collected on assessments prove larger than necessary by
five percent or less the amount of the original roll, the Council may place the
excess in any of the funds of the City, but if such excess shall exceed such
five percent, then the same shall be credited pro rata on the assessments
against the several parcels of lands according to the amounts thereof, such
credit as to each parcel to be made upon the unpaid installment in inverse
numerical order; provided that if as to any parcel there shall be no unpaid
installments or, if the unpaid installments are less than the amount of the
credit, then such total or surplus amount of credit shall be applied toward the
payment of the next City tax levied against such property. If the City shall
have been assessed for any portion of the cost of the improvements, then it
shall be considered in the same category as the owner of private lands and
shall be entitled to its share of any such excess except that any amount due
the City, which in case of private lands, would be applied to the payment of
City taxes, shall be refunded to the City in cash.
Sec. 156  Invalid or irregular assessments.
   Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council, be
invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any
court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal,
the Council shall, whenever the improvement has been made or not, or whether
any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall
be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment, and
whenever the assessment or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been
so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made
shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that
extent be deemed satisfied.
Sec. 157  Assessments on single premises; collection procedure.
   When any expense shall have been incurred by the City upon or in respect to
any single premises, which expense is chargeable against such premises and the
owner thereof under the provisions of this Charter or any ordinance of the City
or law of the State of Michigan, and is not of that class required to be pro-
rated among the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment
district, an account of the labor, material and service for which such expense
was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which
the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be
reported to the Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if
known.
   The Treasurer, at the end of each quarter, shall report to the Council all
sums so owing to the City and which have not been paid within fifteen days
after the mailing of the bill therefor. The Council shall, at such times as it
may deem advisable, direct the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll
covering all such charges reported to it, together with a penalty of ten
percent. Such roll shall be filed with the Clerk, who shall present the same to
the Council.
   Thereafter, the same proceedings shall be followed in respect to such
special assessment roll as are provided in Sections 147 et seq., of this
article and all the provisions of said sections with reference to special
assessments generally shall apply to special assessments under this section,
insofar as the same may be applicable.
Sec. 158  Additional steps and procedures.
   In any case where the provisions of this article prove to be insufficient to
carry into full effect the making of any special assessment, the Council may,
by ordinance, provide any additional steps or procedure required to effect the
improvement by special assessment.
Sec. 159  Exempt land; portions payable by City.
   No lands in a special assessment district which are benefited by the
improvement therein shall be exempt from assessment, but if the same are owned
by a public or other corporation exempt by law from the payment of special
assessments, then the special assessments against such lands, or the
installments thereof, shall be paid by the City as the same become due or may
be paid in advance of their due dates.

Sec. 160  Powers of City.

classification of users thereof, nor shall free service be permitted. Higher
rates may be charged for service outside the corporate limits of the City.
Sec. 163  Collection of rates and charges.
   The Council shall provide by ordinance for the collection of all public
utility rates and charges of the City. Such ordinances shall provide at least:
   (a)   That the City of Southgate shall provide for the collection of such
utility rates and charges upon the supply of such utility service and shall be
enforced in the manner provided in such ordinance; however, said ordinance
shall not create a lien upon the real property supplied unless authorized and
permitted by statute.
   (b)   The terms and conditions under which utility services may be

   Unless approved by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the electors
voting thereon at a regular or special election, the City of Southgate shall
not sell, exchange, lease or in any way dispose of any property, easements,
equipment, privileges or assets belonging to and appertaining to any
Municipally owned public utility which is needed to continue operating such
utility. All contracts, negotiations, licenses, grants, leases or other forms
of transfer in violation of this section shall be void and of no effect as
against the City of Southgate. The restrictions of this section shall not apply
to the sale or exchange of any articles of machinery or equipment of any City
owned public utility which are worn out or useless or which have been or could,
with advantage to the service, be replaced by new and improved machinery or
equipment, to the leasing of property not necessary for the operation of the
utility or to the exchange of property or easements for other needed property
or easements. It is provided, however, that the provisions of this section

accounts under an appropriate fund caption, which accounts shall be classified
in accordance with generally accepted utility accounting practice. Charges for
all service furnished to, or rendered by, other City departments or agencies
shall be recorded. An annual report shall be prepared to show fairly the
financial position of each utility and the result of its operation, which
report shall be available for inspection at the office of the Clerk.

   All franchises to which the Township of Ecorse is a party when this Charter
becomes effective shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions.
Sec. 167  Franchise ordinances.
   Public utility franchises and all renewals and extensions thereof and
amendments thereto shall be granted by ordinance only. No exclusive franchise
shall ever be granted. No franchise shall be granted for a longer period than
thirty years.
   No franchise ordinance which is not subject to revocation at the will of the
Council shall be enacted nor become operative until the same shall have first
been referred to the people at a regular or special election and received the
affirmative vote of three-fifths of the electors voting thereon. No such
franchise ordinance shall be approved by the Council for referral to the
electorate before thirty days after application therefor has been filed with
the Council, nor until a public hearing has been held thereon, nor until the
grantee named therein has filed with the Clerk his unconditional acceptance of
all terms of such franchise. No special election for such purposes shall be
ordered unless the expenses of holding such election, as determined by the
Council, shall have first been paid to the Treasurer by the grantee.
   A franchise ordinance or renewal or extension thereof or amendment thereto
which is subject to revocation at the will of the Council may be enacted by the
Council without referral to the voters, but shall not be enacted unless it
shall have been complete in the form in which it is finally enacted and shall
have so been on file in the office of the Clerk for public inspection for at
least four weeks after publication of a notice that such ordinance is so on
file.
Sec. 168  Rights of City.
   All public utility franchises granted after the adoption of this Charter,
whether it be so provided in the granting ordinance or not, shall be subject to
the following rights of the City of Southgate, but this enumeration shall not
be exclusive or impair the right of the Council to insert in such franchise any
provisions within the power of the City to impose or require.
   (a)   To repeal the same for misuse, nonuse or failure to comply with the
provisions thereof;
   (b)   To require proper and adequate extension of plant and service and
maintenance thereof at the highest practicable standard of efficiency;
   (c)   To establish reasonable standards of service and quality of products
and prevent unjust discrimination in service or products and prevent unjust
discrimination in service or rates;
   (d)   To require continuous and uninterrupted service to the public in
accordance with the terms of the franchise throughout the entire period
thereof;
   (e)   To use, control and regulate the use of its streets, alleys, bridges
and other public places and the space above and beneath them;
   (f)   To impose such other regulations as may be determined by the Council
to be conducive to the safety, welfare and accommodation of the public.
   (g)   Any franchise granted to a public utility which is not subject to the

make provisions for fixing and adjusting the rates and charges to be made by
such grantee from and after the effective date of the franchise.
Sec. 169  Basis for rates and charges.
   All public utility franchises shall make provision therein for fixing rates,
fares and charges and may provide for readjustments thereof at periodic
intervals. The value of the property of the utility used as a basis for fixing
such rates, fares and charges shall in no event include a value predicated upon
the franchise, goodwill or prospective profits.
Sec. 170  Use of public ways.
   Every public utility, whether it has a franchise or not, shall pay such part
of the cost of improvement or maintenance of streets, alleys, bridges and other
public places as shall arise from its use thereof and shall protect and save
the City harmless from all damages arising from said use. Every such public
utility may be required by the City of Southgate to permit joint use of its
property and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys and other public
places of the City by the City and by other utilities insofar as such joint use
may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor.
In the absence of agreement and upon application by any public utility, the
Council shall provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of such joint
use and the compensation to be paid therefor, and the arbitration award shall
be final.
Sec. 171  Rights of grantee.
   The grantee of a franchise may not sell, assign, sublet or allow another to
use the same, unless the Council gives its consent. Nothing in this section
shall limit the right of the grantee of any public utility franchise to
mortgage its property or franchise, nor shall restrict the rights of the
purchaser, upon foreclosure sale, to operate the same, except that such
mortgagee or purchaser shall be subject to the terms of the franchise and
provisions of this article.
Article 10 Ordinances
Sec. 172  Enacting clause; introduction.

   Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, the Council by a majority vote
of those present at any regular or special meeting shall have power to enact
such valid ordinances as they deem necessary, and to amend by ordinance and/or

amended shall be re-enacted at length. Any ordinance may be repealed by
reference only to its title and number.
Sec. 174  Record and authentication; publication.
   All ordinances shall be recorded in an indexed book marked “Ordinance Book,”

the final passage of the ordinance, but failure to so record and authenticate
any ordinance shall not invalidate it or suspend its operation.
   It shall be the duty of the Clerk to cause every ordinance to be published
either on the City’s official web page or by posting the same in three public
places within the City. And it shall be the duty of the Council to designate
which method of publication shall be used. The publication of an ordinance in
the Council proceedings shall be deemed a sufficient publication. The Clerk
shall immediately, after such publication, enter in the “Ordinance Book,” under
the record of the ordinance, a certificate under his hand stating the time and
method of such publication. Such certificate shall be prima-facie evidence of
the due publication of the ordinance.

effective date is provided therein.

dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ninety days, or
both, in the discretion of the court. Such imprisonment may be in the City
prison, if any, in the  Wayne County Jail or in any penal institution in the
State authorized by law to receive prisoners from the City.
Sec. 177  Limitation on prosecutions.
   Prosecution for violation of any ordinance of the City shall be commenced
within two years after the commission of the offense; provided that the
limitation herein imposed shall not be construed as a limitation of the City's
rights to forfeit any franchise, grant or license for violation of the terms
and conditions thereof after said two-year period.
Sec. 178  Pleadings; reference by ordinance title and number.
   In all judicial proceedings, it shall be sufficient to plead any ordinance
by title and number of the applicable section or sections, and it shall not be
necessary to set forth the entire ordinance or section in any pleadings.
Sec. 179  Judicial notice.
   Judicial notice shall be taken of the enactment, existence, provisions and
the continuing force of all ordinances of the City. Whenever it shall be
necessary to prove any ordinance in any judicial proceedings, the same may be

as a true copy by the Clerk, under the Seal of the City, or from any volume
purporting to have been published, printed and compiled by authority of the
Council.
Sec. 180  Township ordinances continued.
   All ordinances in force in the Township of Ecorse at the time this Charter
shall take effect and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof, shall remain
and be in force until repealed or a new ordinance adopted.
Sec. 181  Adoption of State law and technical codes by reference.
   The Council may adopt any provisions of State law or any detailed technical
regulations as a City ordinance or code by citation of such provisions of State
law or by reference to any recognized standard code, official or unofficial,
provided that any such provisions of State law or recognized official or
unofficial standard code shall be clearly identified in the ordinance adopting
the same as an ordinance of the City. Where any recognized official or
unofficial standard code is adopted, it may be published by providing to the
public in the office of the Clerk not less than fifty copies in book or booklet
form available for public distribution at a reasonable charge, and any
amendment to or revision of such adopted code or detailed technical ordinance
may be published in the same manner.
Sec. 182  Codification of ordinances.
   The City Council shall, within a period of two years after the adoption of
this Charter, enact such ordinances as are necessary for the efficient
operation of the City, and shall provide for the establishment of the same in a
codified form, and shall provide for the same to be printed in book or booklet
form available for public distribution in the office of the Clerk at a
reasonable charge.
Article 11 Initiative and Referendum
Sec. 183  Filing of petitions.
   Any ordinance which may be legally adopted by the Council of the City of
Southgate may be proposed by a petition signed by registered electors of the
City, not less in number than fifteen percentum of all votes cast for Mayor at
the last preceding election at which a Mayor of the City was elected, but in no
case less than three hundred. Such petition shall be addressed to the Council
of the City of Southgate, and shall set forth at length the ordinance proposed
to be enacted. With each signature attached thereto shall be given the place of
residence with the street and number of the elector so signing, and the date
when such signature was attached. Such signatures need not all be on one paper,
but all petitions shall be filed with the City Clerk at one and the same time.
An affidavit or affidavits shall be made by one or more registered electors of
the City, which affidavits shall state that each signature appearing upon the
petition to which such affidavit is attached is a genuine signature of the
person whose name it purports to be, and that to the best of affiant's
knowledge and belief, the signers whose names are attached to said petition are
registered electors of the City of Southgate. The petition proposing an
ordinance shall be in the following form:
   To the Honorable Council of the City of Southgate, Michigan:
   We the undersigned registered electors of the City of Southgate, under and
by virtue of the authority granted by Act No. 279 of the Public Acts of 1909 as
amended, and by the Charter of the City of Southgate, do hereby propose and
initiate for submission to the qualified electors of the City of Southgate, the
following proposed ordinance:
(Here set forth proposed ordinance in full)
and your petitioners will ever pray
   ...................   ...................      ............................   
   Name                Number-Street      Date of Signing
AFFIDAVIT
   State of Michigan
   County of Wayne--ss.
........................, being first duly sworn, deposes and says that the
names appearing upon the foregoing petition are the genuine signatures of the
persons whose names appear thereon, and that to the best of affiant's knowledge
and belief, such persons are registered electors of the City of Southgate:
   Subscribed and sworn to before me this ....... day of ..............,
19.....
   Said petitions, when signed by the requisite number of registered electors,
shall be filed with the City Clerk. Such Clerk shall attach thereto a
certificate, setting forth the name and address of the person or persons filing
the said petition in his office, and the date when said petition was filed.  A
copy of said petition, exclusive of signatures, together with said certificate,
shall be entered in a record book to be kept for that purpose in the office of
the City Clerk.
Sec. 184  Examination of petitions; action by Council.
   Within ten days from the date of the filing of said petition with the City
Clerk, it shall be the duty of such Clerk to ascertain, by comparison of said
petition with the registration records of the City of Southgate, whether or not
such petitions contain the requisite number of signatures of registered
electors as the same appear on the registration records of the City, and
following such examinations, the Clerk shall attach to such petition his
certificate showing the result of such examination. If the certificate of the
Clerk so attached shows the petition to be insufficient, he shall, within ten
days, cause notice in writing, setting forth the fact that such petitions are
found to be insufficient, to be served upon one or more of the persons
designated in the certificate attached by him to said petition as the persons
who filed said petition in his office. Additional signatures properly verified
as hereinbefore provided, may be filed with the Clerk at any time within
fifteen days from the date of the service of such notice. The City Clerk shall
attach his certificate to such additional petitions and shall cause them to be
entered in the record book as herein provided to be done when the original
petitions are filed. The Clerk shall within five days after the filing of such
additional petitions make like comparisons of the additional signatures with
the registration books and attach thereto his certificate of the result. If the
number of signatures are still shown to be insufficient, or if no additional
signatures are so filed, the Clerk shall, upon demand, return the petition to
any of the persons designated as filing it, without prejudice, however, to the
filing of a new petition for the same purpose. Whenever the petition shall be
found by the City Clerk to be sufficient, he shall so certify, and submit the
same with his certificate to the Council at its next regular meeting.
   At such next regular meeting the Council shall proceed to consider such
petition, including the form and purpose of the ordinance thereto attached. If
such ordinance be not legal, in form or otherwise, the Council shall so declare
by resolution and shall direct the Clerk to return said petition immediately to
any of the persons designated as filing it, without prejudice to filing a new
petition for the same purpose. If the Council, upon consideration, finds such
ordinance legal, then it may provide for public hearings on such ordinance;
and, if it deems the same advisable, shall pass such ordinance within four
weeks from the day of the filing of such petition with the City Clerk. If the
Council finds such petition and ordinance legal and does not pass such
ordinance within the time herein limited, it shall, within two weeks after its
failure to pass such ordinance, provide for the submission of such ordinance to
the qualified electors of the City at the next election, occurring more than
thirty days thereafter, at which questions or propositions submitted by the
Council may be voted upon by the electors; but no special election shall ever
be called by the Council for the purpose of referendum only.
Sec. 185  Petitions of protest and referendum.
   Within thirty days after the publication of any ordinance duly passed by the
Council, a petition may be presented to the Council protesting against such
ordinance continuing in effect. Said petition shall contain the text of such
ordinance and shall be signed by registered electors of the City, not less than
fifteen percentum of all votes cast for Mayor at the last preceding election at
which a Mayor of the City was elected, but in no case less than three hundred.
Said ordinance shall thereupon and thereby be suspended from operation, and the
Council shall immediately reconsider such ordinance.
   If the ordinance be not entirely repealed, the Council shall submit the
question of whether or not it shall become effective to a vote of the electors
of the City. The procedure in regard to such petition of protest and referendum
shall be the same as hereinabove in this article provided for the initiative
and referendum of a proposed ordinance, with such modification as the case may
require.
Sec. 186  Submission of referendum by Council.
   The Council may, of its own motion, submit to a referendum for adoption or
rejection by the electors of the City, any proposed ordinance or measure or a
proposal for the repeal of the amendment of any ordinance, in the same manner
and with the same force and effect as provided in this article for submission
on petition.
Sec. 187  Referendum ordinances; elections.
   The ordinance or other measure or proposal submitted to the electors shall
be published at least once in the official newspaper of the City at least ten
days prior to the election at which it is to be submitted. If the majority vote
of the electors voting at the election is "For the Ordinance" (or other
proposition), the same proceedings shall be taken, after the canvass of the
returns and declaration of results by the Council, as would be necessary if the
same action upon such proposition had been taken by the Council itself, except
that in the case of ordinances, no further publication thereof shall be
required. Except as in this article otherwise provided, all of the provisions
of Chapter III (Article 2) of this Charter for the calling and holding of City
elections shall apply to referendum elections, as near as may be, and the
proposition upon the ballot shall state the nature and purpose of the ordinance

electors of the City of Southgate and who, while in office, shall not hold any
other City office or City employment and shall not serve on any Municipal
political committee or take part in the management of any Municipal political
campaign. Membership on the Commission shall be limited to those persons known

hereinbefore created, shall be appointed as follows: The Mayor shall make the
appointment subject to the approval of the Council, and shall appoint one
member whose term expires in 1961. Municipal employees shall appoint one member
whose term expires in 1960. The two members so appointed shall, at their first
meeting after their appointment, which shall be held less than thirty days
after their appointment, appoint one member whose term shall expire in 1962. If
within sixty days after their appointment the two members cannot agree on said
appointment, then the Council shall make such appointment. Thereafter, upon the
expiration of the respective terms of the Commission, the party making the
appointment in the first instance shall continue to appoint for that term and
all reappointments after the expiration of the original terms shall be for a
term of three years each. The term of office of the Civil Service Commission
members shall commence and terminate on the same date as other appointive
officers as provided in this Charter, and their eligibility for appointment
shall be the same as other appointive officers, except where the same would
conflict with the provisions of this article, then the provisions of this
article shall govern.
Sec. 228  Compensation; vacancies.
   The members of the Commission shall serve without compensation. The
Commission shall select its own chairman and determine its own rules of

procedure.

produce books, papers and other evidence as ordered under the provisions of
this section shall constitute misconduct in office. Failure on the part of any
employee or other person to obey such summons or to produce books, papers or
other evidence as ordered under the provisions of this section shall constitute
a violation of the City Charter and such employee, when found guilty of such
violation by a competent tribunal, may be punished by a fine of not to exceed
one hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisonment not to exceed ninety days, or
both, in the discretion of the court.
   (e)   It is further provided that, in case of failure on the part of any
person to obey such summons or to produce such books, papers and other evidence
as so ordered, the Commission may invoke the aid of the Circuit Court of Wayne
County in requiring obeyance of such summons or production of such books,
papers and other evidence. The Circuit Court of Wayne County, in case of
contumacy or refusal to obey such summons or to produce such books, papers and
other evidence, may issue an order requiring such person to obey such summons
or to produce such books, papers and other evidence and to give evidence
touching the matter in question, and any failure to obey such order of the

actions, demotions, suspensions, dismissals and layoffs subject to the two
following paragraphs.
   (a)   The tenure of everyone holding an office, place, position or
employment in the classified service shall be only during good behavior and
efficient service; and any such person may be removed or discharged, suspended
without pay or deprived of vacation privileges or other special privileges for
incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct,

   (b)   When it is necessary to lay off employees because of material change
in duties or organization, or lack of work or funds, such layoffs shall be
accomplished by suspending in numerical order commencing with the last person
appointed until the necessary reduction has been accomplished. Employees so
laid off shall have their names placed on a re-employment list, which list
shall be the first source for filling appropriate vacancies as they occur. No
names shall remain on a re-employment list for longer than two years, except by
specific action of the Commission.
Sec. 239  Right of appeal; procedure.
   Any employee in the classified service, except one serving in his
probationary period, who is aggrieved because of any action affecting his
status or condition of employment which has not been adjusted to his
satisfaction after consultation with his appointing officer or body may, within
two weeks of the time he has been formally notified of such action by his
appointing officer or body, file a written appeal with the Commission
requesting a hearing thereon. This right of appeal shall not apply to one or
more suspensions totalling not over seven days in any calendar year. Such
appeal shall state the pertinent facts relative to the cause of complaint and
shall be signed by the employee. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the
effect of the personnel action complained of. The Commission shall investigate
each such appeal and shall promptly hold a hearing thereon. A record of the
proceedings of such hearing shall be kept by the Commission.
   After considering the facts brought out in the investigation and hearing,
the Commission shall determine whether such action was made for political or
religious reasons or without just cause. If it so determines that it was made
for such reasons or without just cause, it shall order that the employee be
restored to the status existing before such action. If it finds otherwise, it
shall report its decision and order in writing to the employee making the
appeal and to his appointing officer or body. The Commission shall render its
decision in all matters affecting an employee within thirty days after receipt
of the appeal.
   Except as hereinafter provided, the decision and order of the Commission
shall be final and the affected parties shall comply therewith. If the decision
finds the action was made for political or religious reasons or without just
cause, it shall order the employee reinstated with payment of any lost salary
or wages. Documents which may have been considered by the Commission and the
decision and order of the Commission shall be promptly filed with the secretary
of the Commission, and shall be public record.
   The Circuit Court of Wayne County, upon petition of any party aggrieved, may
review, by certiorari, any final decision or order of the Commission. The
issuance of such writ shall not however, unless specifically ordered by the
Court, operate as a stay of such decision or order. The decision of such Court
shall be final, subject to appeal of the Supreme Court.
   The removing officer and the person sought to be removed shall at all times,
both before the Commission and upon appeal, be given the right to employ
counsel to represent either of them before said Commission and upon appeal.

acquires at least ten years of credited service.
   (c)   In no case shall a member's straight life pension exceed an amount
equal to the number of years, and fraction of a year, of his credited service
multiplied by two percent of his final average salary; less such years
multiplied by 1.75 percent of his Social Security Primary Benefit payable under
Title II of the Federal Social Security Act (OASDI) as in effect on the date
his pension begins; provided that provision may be made for a minimum pension
not to exceed twenty percent of his final average salary for a member who
retires on account of his total and permanent disability.
   (d)   In no case shall the pensions to be provided dependents of a member
who dies while in the employ of the City exceed the pensions to be provided for
in paragraph (a) above, or workmen's compensation payable on account of the
said member's death, whichever amount is greater.
   (e)   A member's final average salary shall be the average of the highest
annual compensations paid him by the City and the former Ecorse Township during

   (g)   The liabilities of the retirement system shall be actuarially
evaluated annually by an actuary designated by the Board of Trustees. The said
liabilities shall be financed by annual appropriations to be made by the
Council, said appropriations to be determined as follows:
   (h)   The appropriations for members' current service shall be a percent or
percents (percentage) of their annual compensations which will produce an
amount which, when paid annually by the City during their future service, will
be sufficient at the time of their retirements to provide the reserves, not
financed by members' contributions, for the portions of the pensions to be paid
them based upon their future service.
   (i)   The appropriations for members' accrued service shall be a percent or
percents (percentage) of their annual compensations which will produce an
amount which, when paid annually by the City over a period of years, to be
determined by the Council, will amortize, at a prescribed rate of interest, the
unfunded pension reserves for the accrued service portions of the provisions to
which they might become entitled.
   (j)   The appropriations for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries
shall be a percent or percents (percentage) of the annual compensations of
members which will produce an amount which, when paid annually by the City over
a period of years, to be determined by the council, will amortize, at a
prescribed rate of interest, the unfunded pension reserves for pensions being
paid retirants and beneficiaries.
   (k)   In no case shall social security taxes be paid from funds of the
retirement system or from funds due the retirement system.

209.01  PURPOSE.
   The City finds that a significant and continuous potential exists for
extraordinary response situations based upon prior events which have taken
place in the City, including those involving specialized response resources,
that have and will continue to place a substantial financial and operational
burden upon police protection services, fire protection services, emergency
medical services, public works services, and other emergency health and safety
services.  The City finds that this chapter is necessary to protect the City
from excessive expense resulting from the utilization of City resources in
response to defined extraordinary situations and to fairly allocate the costs
resulting from incidents among those responsible for them.  The City further
finds that the use of municipal personnel for certain responses interferes with
the provision of routine and necessary public services to the residents of the
City.  The City has also determined that in traffic accidents involving drivers
who are operating under the influence there is a greater likelihood of personal
injury and property damage.  The City further finds that this chapter is
necessary to authorize the imposition of charges and to establish a policy and
set forth the methods by which the City will recover actual costs incurred in
making extraordinary responses and providing services in connection with the
same.  This chapter does not include emergency responses associated with
hazardous or dangerous materials incident or emergencies, which are covered
under the "Hazardous Materials Incident Cost Recovery Ordinance."

      (Ord. 637.  Passed 5-28-97; Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.03  COST RECOVERY AUTHORIZATION AND PROCEDURE.
   The City may recover all assessable costs in connection with extraordinary
response situations from any or all responsible parties, jointly or
separately.  The City may recover all assessable costs in connection with
extraordinary use of municipal personnel from the person, entity or
organization necessitating the extraordinary services. For all other
extraordinary response situations, the City Administrator, or his/her designee,
shall determine the total assessable costs and shall, in consultation with
other City personnel involved in responding to an extraordinary response
situation, determine whether to assess all or part of such costs against any of
the responsible parties. In making such a determination, the following will be
considered:
   (a)   The total assessable costs;
   (b)   The risk that the extraordinary response situation imposed on the City
residents and their property;
   (c)   Whether there was any injury or damage to person or property;
   (d)   Whether the extraordinary response situation required evacuation;
   (e)   The extent the extraordinary response situation required an unusual or
extraordinary use of municipal personnel and equipment; and
   (f)   Whether there was any damage to the environment;
   (g)   The City Council shall set from time to time a schedule of fees
associated with the cost of emergency response and related to this section.
   After consideration of the above listed factors, the City Administrator may
allocate assessable costs among responsible parties, including allocating all
or some of such costs jointly and severally against all parties, rather than
one responsible party, regardless of whether a responsible party has legal
liability therefore or is legally at fault. If the City Administrator
determines not to assess all or part of assessable costs against a responsible
party, such determination shall not in any way limit or extinguish the
liability of the responsible party to other parties.
(Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.04  BILLING AND COLLECTION OF ASSESSABLE COSTS AND LATE PAYMENT FEES.
   (a)   Upon a determination to assess costs incurred under this chapter, the
City will submit an itemized invoice, by first class mail or personal service,
to each responsible party. Such invoice shall be due and payable within thirty
days after the date of mailing, and any amounts unpaid, including any
previously imposed, shall pay a late payment fee equal to one and one-half
percent per month.
   (b)   A determination not to assess costs pursuant to this chapter shall in
no way limit, extinguish or constitute a defense to the liability of any
responsible party to any third party.
   (c)   If the responsible party appeals assessable costs pursuant to Section
209.05, such costs, if upheld in whole or in part, shall be due and payable
thirty days from the date of determination of the appeal and late payment fees
shall apply thereafter.
(Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.05  PROCEDURE FOR APPEALING ASSESSABLE COSTS.
   (a)   Any responsible party who receives an invoice for assessable costs
shall have the opportunity to meet with the City Administrator, or his/her
designee, to request modification of the assessable costs. The responsible
party shall request such a meeting in writing within seven calendar days of the
date of the invoice assessing the costs.
   (b)   If after the meeting with the City Administrator or his/her designee,
the responsible party contests the assessed charges; he or she may request an
opportunity to appear before City Council to further request a modification of
the assessable costs. A responsible party who desires to appear before City
Council must first meet with the City Administrator or his/her designee, as
provided above, and shall file a written request to appear before City Council
with the City Clerk within seven calendar days of the meeting with the City
Administrator.
   (c)   Upon receipt of a request to appear before City Council, the City
Clerk will place the challenge to the assessed cost on the agenda of the next
regularly-scheduled City Council meeting, as long as there are at least
fourteen calendar days after the date on which the responsible party files the
request to appear.
   (d)   The filed request to appear before City Council shall specifically
identify and explain all reasons why the responsible party believes the
assessed costs should be modified. The responsible party has the burden of
proving by a preponderance of relevant facts that the determination is
erroneous in whole or in part. Any reasoning, basis or argument for
modification of assessable costs not set forth in the request to appear before
City Council shall be deemed waived by the responsible party. Failure to timely
file a written request to appear before City Council shall constitute a waiver
of the responsible party's right to appear before City Council and shall
further constitute the responsible party's agreement to pay the assessable
costs invoiced.
   (e)   Once the responsible party has been given the opportunity to appear
before it, City Council shall, within a reasonable time, affirm, reverse, or
modify all or a portion of the payment of the assessable costs invoiced.
Failure of the responsible party to appear before City Council on the appeal
shall constitute a waiver of that party's objections to the assessable costs.
The decision of City Council shall be final.
(Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.06  ASSESSABLE COSTS CONSTITUTE A LIEN UPON PROPERTY.
   Any assessable costs which have been assessed but not paid when due,
including any late payment fees, shall constitute a lien upon the real property
of the responsible party in the City, from which, upon which or related to
which an extraordinary situation occurred.  Such a lien shall be of the
character and effect as the lien created by State statute for General Tax Law
for City real property and shall include accrued interest and penalties.  The
City Treasurer shall verify on March 1 of each year and certify to the City
Assessor the fact that such assessable costs are delinquent and unpaid. The
City Assessor shall then enter the delinquent amount on the next general ad
valorem tax roll as a charge against the affected property, and the lien
thereon shall be enforced in the same manner as provided and allowed by law for
delinquent and unpaid real property taxes.
(Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.07  OTHER REMEDIES.
   In addition to the remedy set forth in Section
209.07, the City shall be entitled to pursue any other remedy or may institute
any appropriate court action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction
as permitted by law to collect assessable costs from a responsible party.
(Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.08  NO LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   The recovery of assessable costs pursuant to this chapter does not limit the
liability of a responsible party under applicable Federal, State or local law.
(Ord. 905.  Passed 5-19-10.)
209.09  PREEMPTION BY FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a Federal or State
statute from preempting this chapter if the Federal or State statute provides
an absolute defense to liability of a responsible party due to the acts of a
third party and that statue expressly or impliedly provides the Federal or
State government with the authority to regulate the specific area of the law,
or the pervasiveness of Federal or State regulation or the nature of the
regulation demonstrates the need for exclusive regulation by the Federal or
State government, including, but not limited to NREPA, MCLA 323.101, et seq.
and CERCLA 42 USC 9601, et seq.

210.01  MAYOR AS PURCHASING AGENT.
   The Mayor shall act as Purchasing Agent of the City, unless he or she
designates another officer or employee of the City to act as Purchasing Agent.
Any such designation shall be in writing and shall be filed with the City
Clerk. In the event of such designation, every purchase order in excess of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be approved by the Mayor before being issued.
The Mayor shall adopt any necessary rules with respect to requisitions and
purchase orders.
(1974 Code § 1.261)
210.02  PURCHASES OR CONTRACTS UNDER $1,000.
   Purchases of supplies, materials or equipment, the cost of which is less
than one thousand dollars ($1,000), may be made in the open market, but such
purchases shall, where practical, be based on at least three competitive bids
and shall be awarded to the lowest qualified bidder. "Lowest qualified bidder,"
as used in this section, means the lowest bidder having qualifications to
perform the work, which qualifications are satisfactory to the City. The
Purchasing Agent may solicit bids verbally or by telephone, or may contact
prospective bidders by written communication. Where bids are solicited by
written communication, a request for such bids shall also be posted in the City
Hall. A record shall be kept of all open market orders and the bids submitted
thereon, which records shall be available for public inspection. Any or all
bids may be rejected.
210.03  PURCHASES OR CONTRACTS OVER $1,000; BIDDING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Any expenditure for supplies, materials, equipment, construction or
maintenance contracts obligating the City, where the amount of the City's
obligation is in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), shall be governed by
this section, except as provided in Section
210.05.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Such expenditure shall be made the subject of a written contract. A
purchase order shall be a sufficient written contract only in cases where the
expenditure is in the usual and ordinary course of the City's affairs, and in
no case shall it be sufficient for the construction of public works, for
contracting for supplies or services over any period of time, or where the
quality of the goods or materials or the scope of the services bargained for is
not wholly standardized.
   (c)   The Purchasing Agent shall solicit bids from a reasonable number of
qualified prospective bidders as are known to him or her by sending each a copy
of a notice requesting bids, which notice shall also be posted in the City
Hall.
   (d)   Unless prescribed by Council, the Purchasing Agent shall prescribe the
amount of any security to be deposited with any bid, which security shall be in
the form of cash, a certified or cashier's check or a bond written by a surety
company authorized to do business in the State. The amount of such security
shall be expressed in terms of a percentage of the bid submitted. Unless fixed
by Council, the Purchasing Agent shall fix the amount of the performance bond
and, in the case of construction contracts, the amount of the labor and
material bond to be required of successful bidders.
   (e)   Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place designated in the
notice requesting bids in the presence of the Purchasing Agent, the City Clerk
and at least one other City official, preferably the head of the department
most closely concerned with the subject of the contract. The bids shall
thereupon be carefully examined and tabulated and shall be reported to Council
with the recommendation of the Purchasing Agent at the next Council meeting.
After tabulation, all bids may be inspected by the competing bidders. In lieu
of the procedure for opening bids specified in this subsection, Council may
direct that bids be opened at a Council meeting.
   (f)   When such bids are submitted to Council, the contract to be executed,
in a form approved by the City Attorney, shall also be submitted. If Council
finds any of the bids to be satisfactory, it shall award the contract to the
lowest qualified bidder and shall authorize execution of the contract upon
execution of the contract by the successful bidder and the filing of any bonds
which may be required, which bonds shall first be approved by  the City
Attorney as to form and content. Such award may be by resolution or ordinance.
Council may reject any or all bids, may waive irregularities in bidding and may
accept bids which do not conform in every respect to the bidding requirements.
   (g)   At the time the contract is executed by the contractor, he or she
shall file a bond, executed by a surety company authorized to do business in
the State, with the City, conditioned upon the performance of such contract and
further conditioned upon payment to all laborers, mechanics, subcontractors and
materialmen, as well as payment of all just debts, dues and demands incurred in
the performance of such work. Such contractor shall also file evidence of
public liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Mayor and agree to
save the City harmless from loss or damage caused to any person or property by
reason of the contractor's negligence.
   (h)   All bids and deposits of certified or cashier's checks may be retained
until the contract is awarded and signed. If any successful bidder fails or
refuses to enter into the contract awarded to him or her within five days after
the same has been awarded, or fails or refuses to file any bond required within
the same time, the deposit accompanying his or her bid shall be forfeited to
the City, and Council may, in its discretion, award the contract to the next
lower qualified bidder or such contract may be re-advertised.
(1974 Code § 1.263)
210.04  CONTRACTS IN EXCESS OF $5,000.
   Any contract involving a consideration in excess of five thousand dollars
($5,000) shall be approved by a majority of Council before the City enters into
the same. Public improvement contracts involving a consideration in excess of
five thousand dollars ($5,000) shall be subject to Section
109 of the City Charter. The City shall not perform any public work where the
cost thereof exceeds an estimated five thousand dollars ($5,000), except in
accordance with Section
107 of the City Charter.
(1974 Code § 1.262)
210.05  EMERGENCY PURCHASES.
   In the case of an emergency, any department head, with the approval of the
Mayor, may purchase directly any supplies, materials or equipment not costing
in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) when immediate procurement is
necessary to the continuation of the work of the department. Such purchases and
the emergency causing them shall be reported in detail to the Purchasing Agent
within a week from the time such purchases are made, and such reports shall be
filed by the Purchasing Agent as permanent public records.
210.06  INSPECTION OF MATERIALS.
   The responsibility for the inspection and acceptance of all materials,
supplies and equipment shall rest with the ordering department.
(1974 Code § 1.265)
210.07  SALE OF PROPERTY.
   Whenever any City property, real or personal, is no longer needed for
corporate or public purposes, the same may be offered for sale or, in the
alternative, donated to a qualified, nonprofit, tax exempt, or charitable
organization if so designated by resolution of the City Council. Any real
property and personal property not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) in
value may be sold for cash by the Purchasing Agent after receiving quotations
or competitive bids therefor for the best price obtainable. Property with a
value in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be sold after advertising
and receiving competitive bids, as provided in Section
210.03, and after approval of the sale has been given by Council.  In the
discretion of City administration, e-bay and the Internet may be used as a
method of advertising and receiving competitive bids, and for completing the
sale of property of any value.
(1974 Code § 1.266; Ord 731.  Passed 10-10-01; Ord. 853.  Passed 7-25-07.)
210.08  ORDINARY PURCHASES; BID REQUIRED LIST.
   Council shall, by resolution, determine the items which are commonly
purchased by the City within a period of one year where the annual cumulative
purchase of such items aggregates in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000)
annually. All such items shall be placed on a bid required list and the
Purchasing Agent, prior to purchasing any items on such list, shall first
determine, by estimate, the aggregate amount of such items as might reasonably
be expected to be purchased by the City during the forthcoming year, and shall
thereupon cause to be prepared specifications and estimates of the amount,
including estimated times of delivery, in order that suppliers of such items
can bid thereon. The Purchasing Agent will then take bids on the estimated
needs of the City in accordance with Section
210.03. Suppliers bidding on items on the bid required list shall not be
required to furnish bid or performance bonds.
210.09  PREVAILING WAGES AND BENEFITS FOR CITY PROJECTS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Construction mechanic" means a skilled or unskilled mechanic,
laborer, worker, helper, assistant, or apprentice working on a City project,
but shall not include executive, administrative, professional, office or
custodial employees.
      (2)   "City project" means new construction, alteration, repair,
installation, painting, decorating, completing, demolition, conditioning,
reconditioning, or improvement of public buildings, works, or roads authorized

work done pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement between the City and
its employees.
      (3)   "Contracting agent" means any officer, board or commission of the
City authorized to enter into a contract for a City project, or to perform a
City project by the direct employment of labor.
(Ord. 485. Passed 10-24-90.)
   (b)   Every contract for a City project, as defined herein, which is
executed between a contracting agent and a successful bidder as contractor,
entered into pursuant to an advertisement and invitation to bid for that City
project, which requires or involves the employment of construction mechanics,
and which is financed, in whole or in part, by the City, shall contain an
express term that the rates of wages and fringe benefits to be paid to each
class of mechanics by the bidder and all of his or her subcontractors shall be
not less than the wage and fringe benefits rate prevailing in the City as
established by the most recent survey of the United States Department of Labor
for prevailing wage determination under the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended.
(Ord. 5-97.  Passed 10-30-96.)
   (c)   A schedule of the prevailing wage and fringe benefits for all classes
of construction mechanics called for in a contract shall be made a part of the
specifications for the work to be performed on a City project, and shall be
printed in the bidding forms where work is to be done by contract.
   (d)   Every contractor and subcontractor on a City project shall keep posted
in a conspicuous place on the construction site a copy of all prevailing wage
and fringe benefit rates prescribed by the contract and shall keep accurate
records showing the name, occupation, and actual wages and benefits paid to
each construction mechanic employed by him or her in connection with said
contract. This record shall be made available on demand for inspection by the
contracting agent or City.
   (e)   The contracting agent, by written notice to the contractor and the
sureties of the contractor known to the contracting agent, shall terminate the
contractor's right to proceed with that part of the contract and City project,
for which less than the prevailing rates of wages and fringe benefits have been
paid or will be paid, and may proceed to complete the contract by separate
agreement with another contractor. The contracting agent shall withhold payment
for work done until liabilities for unpaid wages and excess costs to the City
for reletting the work have been met.
   (f)   In addition to the penalty provided in Section
210.99, any contractor found to be in violation of this section by any
contracting agent shall be disbarred for two years from bidding on any City
project.
(Ord. 485. Passed 10-24-90.)
210.10  LIVING WAGES.
   (a)   Purpose; Application; Exclusions. The intent of the following
provisions is to ensure that the City does not enter into any contract for

any contract for services with any contractor who does not file with the City a
sworn attestation, and demonstrate, if requested, that it pays its work force a
living wage which is equal to one hundred and twenty-five percent of the
Federal Poverty Line, unless health care benefits are provided to its employees
equal to the level of benefits customarily provided in the industry, then the
contractor shall demonstrate that it pays its work force a living wage which is

be required to maintain this rate of pay for the duration of the contract
period.
   (d)   Compliance with Adjustments in the Federal Poverty Line.  The Finance

retained by the covered employer to provide financial assistance and support to
its own operations; or

law.
   (i)   Appeal from Application of this Section.  Any person desiring to
contract with the City shall have the opportunity to appeal the application of
this section to the Living Wage Appeal Committee. The appeal must be filed with
the City Administrator at least 15 days prior to the deadline for the
submission of bids.  The Living Wage Appeal Committee shall consider the
request at a public meeting convened in accordance with the Open Meetings Act
(being P.A. 267 of 1976). The Committee may exempt a contractor from the
application of this section upon demonstration of the following:
      (1)   Hardship. In cases in which compliance with this section would
cause demonstrable financial hardship
      (2)   Resulting Harm. In cases where the benefit of applying this section
is clearly outweighed by the harm resulting from its application.

Appeal Committee shall consist of five members: the Mayor or designee; the City
administrator or designee; a member of the City Council or designee; a member

employee, nor prevent such action as described herein where it is otherwise
authorized by law.
      (10)   Nepotism. No City official or employee shall cause the employment
or any favorable employment action of an immediate family member. No City

   (g)   Complaint Process.
      (1)   Any person may file a written, sworn and signed complaint with the
City Attorney alleging a violation by any officer or employee of the standards
of conduct set out in this section.  If the alleged violation concerns the City
Attorney, then the City Administrator, or at his or her option, Special
Counsel, shall perform the steps required of the City Attorney under this
section.  Each complaint shall be based on personal knowledge and shall fully
state the facts of the violation.
      (2)   The City Attorney shall, within fourteen days, review the complaint
prior to its being submitted to the Board of Ethics and determine: whether or
not the complaint is in the proper form; whether the complaint falls under the
scope and authority of the Board; whether the complaint alleges a prima facie
violation of the Standard of Conduct Ordinance; render a non-binding
recommendation to the Board of Ethics as to what action the Board should take
on the complaint. This recommendation could include requesting a hearing,
forwarding the complaint to another agency for investigation or dismissal of
the complaint.
      (3)   Upon receipt and review of the complaint and the recommendation of
the City Attorney, the Board of Ethics shall decide upon a course of action.
      (4)   If the Board of Ethics orders a hearing, the date for the hearing
shall not be more than thirty days from the date it received the recommendation
of the City Attorney. The time limit shall not apply if the matter is referred
for investigation under division (h) hereof.  Notice of the hearing shall be

for an opinion. The City Attorney shall advise the Board of Ethics in writing
of any request not forwarded and the reason for the denial.
      (2)   Investigation. The Board of Ethics may make such informal
investigation of the facts and issues raised by the request, as the Board deems
advisable. The Board shall render its opinion with thirty days of receiving the
request. The Board of Ethics may reject a request for advisory opinion if the
Board, in good faith, believes the request to be in bad faith, made for
improper purposes, frivolous, of only minor consequence, or has been
effectively ruled on or settled by past actions of the Board of Ethics, a City
ordinance, or other law.
      (3)   If the City officer or employee is the subject of an advisory
opinion and has received a copy of the opinion; his or her actions shall be
prima facie legal and ethical if he or she conforms to the opinion. This
section shall not apply to a criminal act.
      (4)   Advisory opinions may not be used for any purpose not specifically
authorized by this section.  Opinions of the Board shall not be binding but
shall be advisory only.
   (i)   Referral for Agency Investigation.  The Board of Ethics may refer any
alleged violation or incident to the appropriate law enforcement office or
agency at any time for investigation. If any matter has been placed with a law
enforcement agency for investigation, the Board of Ethics shall not proceed
with any hearing concerning the same matter and/or facts until the conclusion
of the investigation.
   (j)   False or Frivolous Complaints.  The filing of a willfully false or
frivolous complaint shall constitute a misdemeanor, and shall be referred to
the City Attorney for criminal prosecution.
   (k)   Prospective Application.  The Board of Ethics shall only investigate
or consider conduct or issues which occur after the effective date of this
section and the Standard of Conduct Ordinance.
   (l)   Other Discipline.  The report and recommendation issued by the Board
of Ethics shall not bind or limit the action that can be taken by the officer's
or employee's supervisor. The request for a hearing shall not stay any
discipline, suspension or discharge. However, the officer ordering the
discipline, suspension or discharge may reconsider that matter after having the
benefit of the report of the Board of Ethics. The City Council and any officer
or employee shall not be obligated to request action by the Board of Ethics
prior to taking any other action allowed by law.
   (m)   Other Action.  The Board of Ethics shall hold any proceedings in
abeyance in the event any complainant, party or person involved in a complaint
to the Board of Ethics is currently involved in any suit, grievance or case
involving the same matter and/or fact until the other proceeding is finally
determined including any appeals.
   (n)   Public Meetings and Records.  All meetings and hearings of the Board
shall be open to the public and shall be subject to the Open Meetings Act, Act
No. 267 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1967, being MCL § 15.261, et seq. The

by the City Council, the Board of Ethics shall appear in person and report to
the City Council.

   (a)   Upon the application of a member, or his or her department head, a
member who has ten or more years of credited service, and who becomes totally
and permanently incapacitated for duty in the employ of the City by reason of a

that after a medical examination of such member, made by or under the direction
of a medical committee consisting of three physicians, one of whom shall be
named by the Board, one by the member and the third to be designated by the
first two physicians so named, the medical committee certifies to the Board

      (3)   Such member should be retired.
   (b)   The ten years service requirement contained in this section shall be
waived in the case of a member whom the Board finds:
      (1)   To be totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the employ
of the City as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury or disease
arising out of and in the course of his or her actual employment with the City;
and
      (2)   Is in receipt of worker's compensation on account of his or her
physical or mental incapacity.

297.17, a member shall receive a disability pension in accordance with Section
297.13, notwithstanding that he or she might not have attained sixty years of
age. In no case shall his or her disability pension payable to his or her
attainment of sixty-five years of age be less than twenty percent of his or her
final average salary. Upon his or her retirement, he or she may elect an option
provided for in Section
297.16.
   (b)   Upon termination of the statutory period for payment of worker's
compensation, if he or she was in receipt of worker's compensation on account
of his or her City employment, a disability retirant shall be given service
credit for such statutory period, and his or her disability pension provided
for in subsection (a) hereof shall be adjusted to include such additional
service credit. However, in no case shall such additional service credit
include any period beyond the retirant's attainment of sixty-five years of age.
(1974 Code § 1.223)
297.19  RE-EXAMINATION OF DISABILITY RETIRANTS; EARNINGS OFFSET.
   (a)   At least once each year during the first five years following the
retirement of a member with a disability pension, and at least once every three
years thereafter, the Board of Trustees may, and upon the retirant's
application shall, require any disability retirant who has not attained sixty
years of age to undergo a medical examination to be made by or under the
direction of a physician designated by the Board. If the retirant refuses to
submit to such medical examination in any such period, the Board may suspend
payment of his or her disability pension until his or her withdrawal of such
refusal. If such refusal continues for one year, the Board may terminate
payment of his or her disability pension. If, upon such medical examination of
such retirant, the physician reports to the Board that the retirant is
physically able and capable of resuming employment with the City, he or she
shall be returned to the employ of the City and his or her disability pension
shall be terminated, provided that the report of such physician is concurred
with by the Board. In returning the retirant to City employment, as provided in
this section, reasonable latitude shall be allowed the city in placing him or
her in a position commensurate to his or her type of work and compensation at
the time of his or her retirement.
   (b)   If a disability retirant who has not attained sixty years of age
becomes engaged in a gainful occupation, business or employment, paying more
than the difference between his or her annual rate of compensation at the time
of his or her retirement and his or her disability pension, his or her
disability pension shall be reduced to an amount which, together with the
amount so earned by him or her, shall equal his or her annual rate of
compensation.
   (c)   A disability retirant who is returned to City employment, as provided
in this section, shall again become a member of the Employees Retirement System
and his or her credited service at the time of his or her retirement shall be
restored to full force and effect. He or she shall be given service credit for
the period he or she was receiving a disability pension provided for in this
chapter if, within such period, he or she was in receipt of worker's
compensation on account of his or her total and permanent disability arising
out of and in the course of his or her City employment. Otherwise, he or she
shall not be given service credit for such period.
(1974 Code § 1.224)
297.20  NONDUTY DEATH BENEFITS.
   (a)   Any member who continues in the employ of the City on or after the
date he or she either acquires twenty-five years of credited service, or
attains sixty years of age and has ten or more years of credited service, may,
at any time prior to the effective date of his or her retirement, but not
thereafter, elect Option A provided for in Section
297.16, in the same manner as if he or she were then retiring from the employ
of the City, and nominate a beneficiary whom the Board of Trustees finds to be
dependent upon him or her for at least fifty percent of his or her support due
to lack of financial means. Prior to the effective date of his or her
retirement, but not thereafter, the member may revoke such election of Option A
and nomination of beneficiary, and he or she may again elect Option A and
nominate a beneficiary as provided in this section. Upon the death of a member
who has an Option A election in force, his or her beneficiary, if living, shall
immediately receive the same pension to which the beneficiary would have been
entitled had the member retired the day preceding the date of his or her death,
notwithstanding that he or she might not have attained sixty years of age. If a
member has an Option A election in force at the time of his or her retirement,
his or her election of Option A and nomination of beneficiary shall thereafter
continue in force, unless, prior to the effective date of his or her
retirement, he or she elects to receive his or her pension as a straight life
pension or according to an option provided for in Section
297.16. No benefits shall be paid under this section on account of the death of
a member if any benefits are paid under Section
297.21 on account of his or her death.
   (b)   If any member who continues in the employ of the City on or after the
date he or she either acquires twenty-five years of credited service, or
attains sixty years of age and has ten or more years of credited service, who
does not have an Option A election in force as provided in subsection (a)
hereof, dies while in the employ of the City and leaves a spouse whom the Board
finds to be totally and permanently disabled and to have been dependent upon
the member for at least fifty percent of his or her support, the spouse shall
immediately receive the same pension to which the spouse would have been
entitled if the member had:
      (1)   Retired the day preceding the date of his or her death,
notwithstanding that he or she might not have attained sixty years of age;
      (2)   Elected Option A provided for in Section
297.16; and
      (3)   Nominated such spouse as beneficiary.
   No benefits shall be paid under this section on account of the death of a
member if any benefits are paid under Section
297.21 on account of his or her death.
(1974 Code § 1.225)
297.21  DUTY DEATH PENSIONS.
   If a member dies as the result of a personal injury or disease arising
solely and exclusively out of and in the course of his or her employment with
the City, and such death, injury or disease resulting in death is found by the
Board of Trustees to have been the result of his or her actual performance of
duty in the employ of the City, the following applicable benefits shall be
paid, subject to the condition that the beneficiaries eligible to pensions
apply for and are in receipt of worker's compensation on account of the death
of the member:
   (a)   The member's accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit
in the Members Deposit fund at the time of his or her death shall be paid in
accordance with Section
297.23.
   (b)   His or her surviving spouse shall receive a pension equal to his or
her weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Such pension
shall begin upon termination of the statutory period for payment of his or her
worker's compensation and shall continue until his or her remarriage.
   (c)   His or her unmarried children under eighteen years of age shall each
receive a pension equal to such child's weekly worker's compensation converted
to an annual basis. Such pension shall begin upon termination of the statutory
period for payment of such child's worker's compensation and shall continue
until his or her adoption, marriage, attainment of eighteen years of age or
death, whichever occurs first. If the spouse's pension is terminated, such
child's pension shall be increased by an equal share of such spouse's pension.
   (d)   His or her parents shall each receive a pension equal to such parent's
weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Such pension shall
begin upon termination of the statutory period for payment of such parent's
worker's compensation and shall continue to remarriage.
   (e)   In no case shall any benefits be paid under this section on account of
the death of a member if any pensions become payable under Section
297.20 on account of his or her death.
(1974 Code § 1.226)
297.22  SUBROGATION.
   If a person becomes entitled to a pension payable from funds of the
Employees Retirement System as the result of an accident or injury caused by
the act of a third party, the City shall be subrogated to the rights of the
person against such third party to the extent of the benefits which the City
pays or becomes liable to pay under this chapter.
(1974 Code § 1.227)
297.23  REFUND OF ACCUMULATED CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   If any member ceases to be employed by the City and is not entitled to
a pension payable from funds of the Employees Retirement System, he or she
shall be paid his or her accumulated contributions standing to his or her
credit in the Members Deposit Fund upon his or her written application for the
same filed with the Board of Trustees.
   (b)   Upon the death of a member, his or her accumulated contributions
standing to his or her credit in the Members Deposit Fund at the time of his or
her death shall be paid to such person as he or she nominated by written
designation duly executed and filed with the Board of Trustees, provided that
no pensions become payable under Section
297.20 on account of his or her death. If there is no such designated person
surviving the member, and if no pensions become payable under Section
297.20 on account of his or her death, his or her accumulated contributions
shall be paid to his or her estate.
   (c)   Refunds of accumulated contributions as provided in this section may
be made in a single sum or in installments as shall from time to time be
determined by appropriate rules and regulations adopted by the Board.
(1974 Code § 1.228)
297.24  AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS; MEMBERS DEPOSIT FUND.
   (a)   The Members Deposit Fund is hereby established. It shall be the fund
in which shall be accumulated, at regular interest, the contributions deducted
from the compensation of members, and from which shall be paid refunds of
accumulated contributions and transfers made as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   The contributions of a member to the Employees Retirement System shall
be the sum of three percent of the maximum annual compensation subject to the
terms of the Federal Social Security Act, plus five percent of the portion, if
any, of the employee's compensation in excess of that subject to the Federal
Social Security Act.
   (c)   The officer responsible for making up the payroll shall cause the
contributions provided for in this section to be deducted from the compensation
of each member on each and every payroll, for each and every payroll period,
from the date of his or her entrance into the Retirement System to the date his
or her membership terminates or to his or her attainment of seventy years of
age, whichever occurs first. The member's contributions provided for in this
section shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by
law for any member shall be thereby changed. Every member shall be deemed to
consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for in this section, and
payment of his or her compensation less such deduction shall be a full and
complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the
services rendered by such person to the City during the period covered by such
payment, except as to benefits provided by this chapter. The officer
responsible for making up the payroll shall certify to the City Treasurer the
amount of the contribution to be deducted from the compensation of each member
for each and every payroll. Such amount shall be deducted by the City Treasurer
and when deducted shall be paid to the Retirement System and credited to the
member's individual account in the Members Deposit Fund.
   (d)   In addition to the contributions deducted from the compensation of a
member hereinbefore provided, a member shall deposit in the Members Deposit
Fund, by a single contribution or by an increased rate of contribution, as the
Board of Trustees shall determine, the amount he or she may have previously
withdrawn from and not repaid to the Members Deposit fund, together with
regular interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. In no
case shall any member be given credit for service rendered prior to the date he
or she withdrew his or her accumulated contributions until he or she pays to
the Members Deposit Fund all amounts due such Fund by him or her.
   (e)   Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated contributions
shall be transferred from the Members Deposit Fund to the Retirement Reserve
Fund. At the expiration of three years from the date an employee ceases to be a
member, any balance standing to his or her credit in the Members Deposit Fund,
unclaimed by the member or his or her estate, shall be transferred to the
Pension Reserve Fund, provided that he or she is not entitled to a deferred
pension provided for in Section
297.15.
(1974 Code § 1.229)
297.25  PENSION RESERVE FUND.
   The Pension Reserve Fund is hereby established. It shall be the fund in
which shall be accumulated the contributions made by the City to the Employees
Retirement System. Upon the basis of mortality and other tables of experience,
and regular interest, as the Board of Trustees shall from time to time adopt,
the actuary shall annually compute the pension reserves for pensions being paid
retirants and beneficiaries, and for service rendered and to be rendered by
members. The portions of the pension reserves not financed by member
contributions shall be financed by annual appropriations to be made by Council
in accordance with the following:
   (a)   The appropriation for members current service shall be a percent or
percents of their annual compensations which will produce an amount which, when
paid annually by the City during their future service, will be sufficient, at
the time of their retirements, to provide the reserves, not financed by member
contributions, for the portions of the pensions to be paid them based upon
their future service.
   (b)   The appropriations for members accrued service shall be a percent or
percents of their annual compensations which will produce an amount which, when
paid annually by the City over a period of years, not to exceed fifty years,
will amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded pension reserves for the
accrued portions of the pensions to which they might become entitled.
   (c)   The appropriation for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries
shall be a percent or percents of the annual compensations of members which
will produce an amount which, when paid annually by the City over a period of
years, not to exceed twenty-five years, will amortize, at regular interest, the
unfunded pension reserves for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries.
   Upon the retirement of a member, the difference between the pension reserve
for the pension payable and his or her accumulated contributions shall be
transferred from the Pension Reserve Fund to the Retirement Reserve Fund.
(1974 Code § 1.230)
297.26  RETIREMENT RESERVE FUND.
   The Retirement Reserve Fund is hereby established. It shall be the fund from
which shall be paid all pensions payable as provided in this chapter. If any
disability retirant returns to active service in the employ of the City, his or
her pension reserve as of the date of his or her return shall be transferred
from the Retirement Reserve Fund to the Members Deposit Fund and the Pension
Reserve Fund in the same proportion as the reserves originally transferred.
(1974 Code § 1.231)
297.27  EXPENSE FUND.
   The Expense Fund shall be the fund to which shall be credited all money
provided by the City to pay the administrative expenses of the Employees
Retirement System, and from which shall be paid all expenses necessary to
properly administer the Retirement System.
(1974 Code § 1.232)
297.28  INVESTMENT OF FUNDS.
   (a)   The Board of Trustees shall be the trustees of the funds of the
Employees Retirement System and shall have full power to invest and re-invest
such funds, subject to the terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions
imposed by the State upon domestic life insurance companies in the making and
disposition of their investments. However, notes, bonds or other obligations of
the City shall not be subject to such conditions, limitations and restrictions,
and no funds of the Retirement System shall be invested in the stock of any
company, association or corporation. The Board shall have the power to purchase
notes, bonds or other obligations of the City at any legally conducted public
or private sale, with or without advertising for bids. The Board shall have the
power to hold, purchase, sell, assign, transfer and otherwise dispose of any
securities and investments in which any of the funds of the Retirement System
have been invested, as well as the proceeds of the investments and any moneys
belonging to the Retirement System.
   (b)   There shall be kept on deposit available cash, not to exceed ten
percent of the total assets of the Retirement System. All funds of the
Retirement System shall be held for the sole purpose of meeting disbursements
for pensions and other payments authorized by this chapter and shall be used
for no other purpose. In no case shall social security taxes be paid from funds
of the Retirement System or from funds due the Retirement System.
   (c)   The descriptions of the various funds of the Retirement System,
namely, the Members Deposit Fund, the Pension Reserve Fund, the Retirement
Reserve Fund and the Expense Fund, shall be interpreted to refer to the
accounting records of the Retirement System and not to the actual segregation
of moneys in the various funds of the Retirement System.
(1974 Code § 1.233)
297.29  ALLOWANCE OF REGULAR INTEREST.
All interest and other earnings on moneys and investments of the Employees
Retirement System shall be credited to the Pension Reserve Fund. The Board of
Trustees shall, at the end of each fiscal year, allow and credit regular
interest on a member's individual balance in the Members Deposit Fund at the
beginning of such fiscal year and on the mean assets credited to the Retirement
Reserve Fund. The amount of interest so allowed and credited shall be charged
to the Pension Reserve Fund.
(1974 Code § 1.234)
297.30  ASSIGNMENTS PROHIBITED.

297.33  EXCESS EARNINGS RESERVE FUND FOR POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
   In accordance with Section 6d of Act 345 of the Public Acts of 1937, as
amended (M.C.L.A. 38.556d), the Police and Fire Retirement System is hereby
amended to provide for an excess earnings distribution program (hereinafter the
"Program") to be administered by the Board of Trustees of the Retirement
System, as follows:
   (a)   An Excess Earnings Reserve Fund is hereby established, which shall be
the Fund to which a percentage of excess earnings, as provided herein, shall be
credited and to which distributions of excess earnings ("post-retirement
supplemental benefits") shall be charged.  "Excess earnings", as used herein,
shall mean those earnings in the Pension Trust Fund on a fiscal year basis 
which exceed the actuarially assumed rate of investment return.  Upon receipt
by the Board of Trustees of the annual actuarial valuation for each fiscal
year, the Board may credit the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund with a percentage
of the excess, if any, of the rate of return on the actuarial value of the
Retirement System assets over the actuarially assumed rate of return multiplied
by the actuarial present value of pensions being paid to retired members and
beneficiaries, as reported in the annual actuarial valuation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, said percentage, as determined by the Board of Trustees, shall
not exceed ten percent.  In the event the Program is terminated, the assets of
the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund shall be transferred to the Reserve for
Retired Benefit Payments of the Retirement System.
   (b)   Annually, the Board of Trustees, in consultation with its actuary and
upon receipt of the actuarial report for each fiscal year, shall determine the
amount, or percentage, if any, of funds from the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund
which may be distributed to eligible retirees and beneficiaries.
   (c)   A regular service retiree shall be eligible to participate in the
Program and in any distribution made pursuant thereto beginning the first day
of the fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the tenth anniversary
of his or her effective service retirement date or deferred retirement
commencement date (i.e. the date the former member would have been eligible for
a regular service retirement had the former member continued in employment).
   (d)   A disability retiree shall be eligible to participate in the Program
and in any distribution made pursuant thereto beginning the first day of the
fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the tenth anniversary of his
or her effective date of conversion to a regular disability pension.
   (e)   A beneficiary of a deceased retiree shall be eligible to participate
in the Program and in any distribution made pursuant thereto beginning the
first day of the fiscal year containing the tenth anniversary of his or her
effective service retirement date or deferred retirement date, or the effective
date of conversion to a regular disability pension attributable to the retiree
from whom the beneficiary's pension was derived.
   (f)   In the case of a survivor beneficiary who is receiving a duty death or
non-duty death pension benefit, said beneficiary shall be eligible to
participate in the Program and in any distribution made pursuant thereto
beginning the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year containing
the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the duty death or non-duty death
pension benefit payable to said beneficiary.
   (g)   The Board of Trustees, on a year-to-year basis, will consider whether
or not to pay post-retirement supplemental benefits and must consider both the
present and future needs of the Retirement System in approving any such
distribution.
   (h)   The Board of Trustees shall not be obligated to pay benefits from the
Excess Earnings Reserve Fund. The distribution of said benefits shall not be
considered an increase in the rate of retirement allowances to be paid and
shall not create a liability for their continuance. Distribution of any portion
of the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund shall in no way be construed as a permanent
increase in pension payments.
   (i)   All distributions under the Program shall be made consistent with and
subject to the taxation and distribution rules of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (j)   The Excess Earnings Reserve Fund shall initially be established by a
one-time transfer to the Fund of an amount equal to ten percent of the excess
of the funding value of assets over the total actuarial accrued liabilities as
contained within the Annual Actuarial Valuation dated June 30, 1995, as
computed by the Board's Actuary.
(Ord. 643.  Passed 7-9-97.)
297.34  EXCESS EARNINGS RESERVE FUND FOR MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
   The Municipal Employees Retirement System is hereby amended to provide for
an excess earnings distribution program (hereinafter the "Program") to be
administered by the Board of Trustees of the Retirement System, as follows:
   (a)   An Excess Earnings Reserve Fund is hereby established which shall be
the Fund to which excess earnings, as provided herein, shall be credited and
interest accrued and to which distributions of excess earnings ("post-
retirement supplemental benefits") shall be charged. "Excess earnings", as used
herein, shall mean the excess, if any, of the recognized rate of return on the
actuarial funding value of retirement system assets which is greater than eight
and one-half percent, multiplied by the actuarial present value of benefits
being paid retired members and survivor beneficiaries, both as reported in the
annual actuarial valuation. Upon receipt by the Board of Trustees of the annual
actuarial valuation for each fiscal year, the Board may credit the Excess
Earnings Reserve Fund at the end of the current fiscal year with the excess
earnings, if any, earned in the prior fiscal year. However, excess earnings, as
determined by the Board of Trustees, shall not exceed ten percent of the
difference between the total market investment income less the actuarially
assumed investment income for the given fiscal year. Prior to crediting of the
prior year's excess earnings, the balance in the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund
as of the last day of the fiscal year shall be credited with interest based
upon the recognized rate of return on the funding value of assets for the prior
fiscal year as reported by the Retirement System's actuary.  However, said
recognized rate of return shall not be greater than the actuarially assumed
rate of investment return for purposes of crediting interest herein. In the
event the Program is terminated, the assets of the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund
shall be transferred to the Reserve for Retired Benefit Payments of the
Retirement System.
   (b)   Annually, the Board of Trustees, in consultation with its actuary and
upon receipt of the actuarial report for each fiscal year, shall determine the
amount, or percentage, if any, of funds from the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund
which may be distributed to eligible retirees and beneficiaries.
   (c)   A regular service retiree on the retirement rolls on December 31 of
each year shall be eligible to participate in the Program and in any
distribution made pursuant thereto beginning the first day of the calendar year
following the calendar year containing the first anniversary of his or her
effective service retirement date or deferred retirement commencement date
(i.e. the date the former member would have been eligible for a regular service
retirement had the former member continued in employment).
   (d)   A disability retiree on the rolls on December 31 of each year shall be
eligible to participate in the Program and in any distribution made pursuant
thereto beginning the first day of the calendar year following the calendar
year containing the first anniversary of his or her effective date of
conversion to a regular disability pension.
   (e)   A beneficiary of a deceased retiree on the rolls on December 31 of
each year shall be eligible to participate in the Program and in any
distribution made pursuant thereto beginning the first day of the calendar year
following the calendar year containing the first anniversary of the effective
service retirement date or deferred retirement date of the effective date of
conversion to a regular disability pension attributable to the retiree from
whom the beneficiary's pension was derived.
   (f)   In the case of a survivor beneficiary who is receiving a duty death or
non-duty death pension benefit, said beneficiary who is on the rolls on
December 31 of each year shall be eligible to participate in the Program and in
any distribution made pursuant thereto beginning the first day of the fiscal
year following the fiscal year containing the first anniversary of the
effective date of the duty death or non-duty death pension benefit payable to
said beneficiary.
   (g)   The Board of Trustees, on a year to year basis, will consider whether
or not to pay post-retirement supplemental benefits and must consider both the
present and future needs of the Retirement System in approving any such
distribution. Distributions shall be non-discriminatory and paid in such manner
and method as the Board deems appropriate. The amount of individual
distributions to qualifying retirees or beneficiaries shall be determined in
such a manner as to equally weight years of retirement and years of service, or
to overweight years of retirement.
   (h)   The Board of Trustees shall not be obligated to pay benefits from the
Excess Earnings Reserve Fund. The distribution of said benefits shall not be
considered an increase in the rate of retirement allowances to be paid and
shall not create a liability for their continuance. Distribution of any portion
of the Excess Earnings Reserve Fund shall be in no way a permanent increase in
pension payments.
   (i)   All distributions under the Program shall be made consistent with and
subject to the taxation and distribution rules of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (j)   The Excess Earnings Reserve Fund shall initially be established by a
one-time transfer to the Fund of the amount of five hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($550,000) from those assets credited to the "thirteenth check -
contingency reserve fund" previously established by the Board of Trustees as
reflected within the Annual Actuarial Valuation dated June 30, 1997, as
prepared by the Board's Actuary. Upon completion of said transfer, the balance,
if any, shall be transferred and/or credited to such reserve as directed by the
employer and the contingency reserve fund shall be discontinued.
(Ord. 668.  Passed 11-25-98.)
297.35   QUALIFIED EXCESS BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT.
   (a)   This section is enacted pursuant to section 415(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code and 2002 PA 100, the Michigan Public Employee Retirement Benefit
Protection Act.
   (b)   A Qualified Excess Benefit Arrangement (QEBA) is established and shall
be governed by a separate plan document and trust as established by the City
Council.
   (c) The amount of any retirement allowance that would exceed the limitations
imposed by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as set forth in the
Retirement System, shall be paid from the QEBA in accordance with necessary and
appropriate procedures established by the Retirement Board for the
administration of the QEBA.
   (d)   The QEBA shall be a separate portion of the Plan. The QEBA is subject
to the following requirements:
      (1)   The QEBA shall be maintained solely for the purpose of providing to
retirants and beneficiaries that part of the retirant's or beneficiary's
retirement allowance otherwise payable under the terms of the Plan, but which
exceed the limitations imposed by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
      (2)   Retirants and beneficiaries do not have an election, directly or
indirectly, to defer compensation to the QEBA.

(Ord. 764.  Passed 11-6-02.)
300.05  MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)   Bureau Established.  The City hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau ("Bureau") as authorized under Section 8396 of the Act to
accept admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions in response
to municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by authorized
officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed by
this code or any ordinance.
   (b)   Location; Supervision; Employees; Rules and Regulations.  The Bureau
shall be located at City Hall, and shall be under the supervision and control
of the City Treasurer. The City Treasurer, subject to the approval of the City
Council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the Bureau and
appoint any necessary qualified city employees to administer the Bureau.
   (c)   Disposition of Violations.  The Bureau may dispose only of municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a
municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has
been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation
shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the City from issuing a municipal
civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation
in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau and may have the violation
processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any
person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau shall not prejudice the person
or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded
by law.
   (d)   Bureau Limited to Accepting Admissions of Responsibility.  The scope
of the Bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of
responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining
civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The Bureau shall not
accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the
offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event
shall the Bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of
any act or matter relating to an alleged violation.
   (e)   Municipal Civil Infraction Violation Notices.  Municipal civil
infraction violation notices shall be issued and serviced by authorized city
officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided
for citations as provided in Section
300.03. In addition to any other information required by this code or other
ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged
violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be
made, the address and telephone number of the Bureau, the hours during which
the Bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation,
and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the
required time.
   (f)   Appearance; Payment of Fines and Costs.  An alleged violator receiving
a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the bureau and
pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearances in
the municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by
mail, in person, or by representation.
   (g)   Procedure Where Admission of Responsibility not Made or Fine not
Paid.  If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal ordinance
violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the
civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the
violation are not paid at the Bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may
be filed with the district court and a copy of the citation may be served by
first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known
address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all
particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by Sections 8705
and 8709 of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the
allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly
inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.
(Ord. 764. Passed 11-6-02)
300.06  SCHEDULE OF CIVIL FINES TO BE ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   A schedule of civil fines payable to the Bureau for admissions of
responsibility by persons served with municipal ordinance violation notices
shall be established.
   (b)   A copy of the schedule, as amended from time to time, shall be posted
at the
Bureau.
(Ord. 764.  Passed 11-6-02.)
300.07  CONVERTED OFFENSES.
   (a)   First violations of the following sections of the this code shall
hereinafter be considered municipal civil infractions for purposes of Public
Act 12 of 1994, for the first day of violation, shall be subject to the
following designated fine for the first day of violation, payable to the Civil
Infraction Bureau by persons admitting responsibility, and shall not be
construed as, or subject to the general penalty provisions for misdemeanors, as
set forth in Section
202.99 of this code, or the applicable building code, respectively:
   (b)   Increased civil fines may be imposed for repeated or continuing
violations by a person of any requirement or provision of this Code.  As used
in this section, "repeated offense" means a second (or any subsequent, or
continuing) municipal civil infraction violation of the same requirement or
provision:
      (1)   Committed by a person within any six-month period (unless some
other period is specifically provided by this code); and
      (2)   For which the person admits responsibility or is determined to be
responsible.
   (c)   Unless otherwise specifically provided by this code or any ordinance
for a particular municipal civil infraction violation, the increased fine for
repeat offenses shall be as follows:
      (1)   The fine for any offense which is a second offense, or which is a
continuing daily offense occurring for a second consecutive day, shall be twice
that of the first offense, plus costs of ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   The fine for any offense which is a third repeat offense or for a
third or more consecutive day offense, shall be four times that of the first
offense, plus costs of ten dollars ($10.00).
   (d)   The fines which may be imposed by the district court for municipal
civil infractions citations shall be twice those set forth above and shall
additionally be subject to the assessment of court costs in an amount to be
determined at the discretion of the court.

5.15(1), (3), or (4) hereof.
   (2)   A peace officer may also arrest a person if the person is found in the
driver's seat of a vehicle parked or stopped on a highway or street within the
City of Southgate if any part of the vehicle intrudes into the roadway and the
peace officer has reasonable cause to believe the person was operating the
vehicle in violation of Section 5.15(1), (3), or (4) hereof.
   (3)   A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person was
operating a vehicle upon a public highway or other place open to the general
public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated
for the parking of vehicles, in the City of Southgate, and that the person, by
the consumption of intoxicating liquor, may have been affected in his or her

breath analysis as provided in this section. This section does not limit the
use of other competent evidence by the peace officer to determine whether to
order a person out-of-service under M.C.L. 257.319d.
   (5)   A person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle and who is
requested to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis under this

both, in a driver's blood or urine, or the amount of alcohol in a person's
breath, at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the person's

proceeding.
      (b)   A person arrested for a crime described in Section 5.15c(1) hereof
shall be advised of all of the following:
         (i)   That if he or she takes a chemical test of his or her blood,

the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer one of
the chemical tests; that the results of the test are admissible in a judicial
proceeding as provided in Section 5.15 et seq. hereof and shall be considered
with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the
defendant; and that he or she is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis
of a test sample obtained pursuant to his or her own request.
         (ii)   That if he or she refuses the request of a peace officer to
take a test described in subparagraph (i), a test shall not be given without a
court order, but the peace officer may seek to obtain such a court order.
         (iii)   That his or her refusal of the request of a peace officer to

being M.C.L. 333.16215, who is qualified to withdraw blood acting in a medical
environment, at the request of a peace officer, may withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled
substance, or both, in the person's blood as provided in this subsection.
Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing or
analyzing blood and related procedures shall not attach to a qualified person
who withdraws or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in
accordance with this act unless the withdrawal or analysis is performed in a
negligent manner.
      (d)   A chemical test described in this subsection shall be administered
at the request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person has committed a crime described in Section 5.15c(1). A person who takes
a chemical test administered at the request of a peace officer, as provided in
this section, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to have a person of his
or her own choosing administer one of the chemical tests described in this
subsection within a reasonable time after his or her detention. The results of
the test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant. If the person
charged is administered a chemical test by a person of his or her own choosing,
the person charged shall be responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of
the test sample.
      (e)   If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the driver's
blood is withdrawn at that time for the purpose of medical treatment, the
results of a chemical analysis of that sample shall be admissible in any civil
or criminal proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or the presence of a
controlled substance, or both, in the person's blood at the time alleged,
regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical
test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall
disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the
results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this subdivision. A
medical facility or person disclosing information in compliance with this
subsection shall not be civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.
      (f)   If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent's blood shall be withdrawn in a
manner directed by the medical examiner for the purpose of determining the
amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled    substance, or both, in the
decedent's blood. The medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical
analysis of the sample to the law enforcement agency investigating the
accident, and that agency shall forward the results to the Department of State
Police.
   (8)   The provisions of subsection (7) relating to chemical testing do not
limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the
question of whether or not a person was impaired by, or under the influence of,
intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating
liquor and a controlled substance, or whether the person had a blood alcohol
content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of
breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, or, if the person is less than 21 years
of age, whether the person had any bodily alcohol content within his or her
body. As used in this section, "any bodily alcohol content" means either of the
following:
      (a)   An alcohol content of not less than 0.02 grams or more than 0.07
grams per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67
milliliters of urine.

consumption of intoxicating liquor, other than consumption of intoxicating
liquor as a part of a generally recognized religious service or ceremony.
   (9)   If a chemical test described in subsection (7) is administered, the
results of the test shall be made available to the person charged, or the
person's attorney, upon written request to the prosecution with a copy of the
request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the results at
least 2 days before the day of trial. The results of the test shall be offered
as evidence by the prosecution in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the
request shall bar the admission of the results into evidence by the
prosecution.
   (10)   Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of Section
5.15(1)(b) or (4) hereof, the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood, breath,
or urine at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the person's
blood, breath, or urine, shall give rise to the following presumptions:
      (a)   If there were at the time 0.07 grams or less of alcohol per 100
milliliters of the defendant's blood, per 210 liters of the defendant's breath,
or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine, it shall be presumed that the
defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was not impaired due to the
consumption of intoxicating liquor and that the defendant was not under the
influence of intoxicating liquor.
      (b)   If there were at the time in excess of 0.07 grams or less of
alcohol per 100 milliliters of the defendant's blood, per 210 liters of the
defendant's breath, or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine, it shall be
presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a vehicle was impaired within
the provisions of Section 5.15(3) due to the consumption of intoxicating
liquor.
      (c)   If there were at the time 0.10 grams or more of alcohol per 100
milliliters of the defendant's blood, per 210 liters of the defendant's breath,
or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine, it shall be presumed that the
defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
   (11)   A person's refusal to submit to a chemical test as provided in
subsection (7) hereof shall be admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime
described in Section 5.15c(1) hereof only for the purpose of showing that a
test was offered to the defendant, but not as evidence in determining the
innocence or guilt of the defendant. The jury shall be instructed accordingly.

   (4)   Before imposing sentence, other than court-ordered license sanctions,
for a violation of Section 5.15(1), (3), or (4) hereof, the court shall order
the person to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency designated
by the office of substance abuse services to determine whether the person is
likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug
education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. As part of the sentence, the
court may order the person to participate in and successfully complete one or
more appropriate rehabilitative programs. The person shall pay for the costs of
the screening, reassessment and rehabilitative services.
   (5)   Immediately upon acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere or upon entry of a verdict of guilty for a violation of Section 5.15
(1), (3), or (4) hereof, whether or not the person is eligible to be sentenced
as a multiple offender, the court shall consider all prior convictions
currently entered upon the Michigan driving record of the person, except those

be constitutionally invalid, and shall impose the following licensing
sanctions:
      (a)   For a conviction under Section
5.15(1):
         (i)   If the court finds that the convicted person has no prior
conviction within 7 years for a violation of M.C.L. 257.625(1), (3), (4), or

order the Secretary of State to suspend the operator's or chauffeur's license
of the person for a period of not less than 6 months or more than 2 years. The
court may order the Secretary of State to issue to the person a restricted
license during all or a specified portion of the period of suspension, except
that a restricted license shall not be issued during the first 30 days of the
period of suspension.
         (ii)   If the court finds that the person has one prior conviction

child in the front seat without a safety belt.
   (5)   Enforcement of this section by State or local law enforcement agencies
may be a primary action regardless of whether a driver of a motor vehicle has
been detained for a suspected violation of another section of this Act.
   (6)   Failure to wear a safety belt in violation of this section may be
considered evidence of negligence and may reduce the recovery for damages
arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle.

five percent.

410.05  TRANSPORTATION OR POSSESSION OF ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR BY PERSON LESS THAN
TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE.
   (a)   A person less than 21 years of age shall not knowingly transport or
possess alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle as an operator or occupant unless
the person is employed by a licensee under the Michigan Liquor Control Code of
1998, 1998 PA 58, M.C.L. 436.1101 to 436.2303, a common carrier designated by
the Liquor Control Commission under the Michigan Liquor Control Code of 1998,
1998 PA 58, M.C.L. 436.1101 to 436.2303, the Liquor Control Commission, or an
agent of the Liquor Control Commission, and is transporting or having the
alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle under the person's control during regular
working hours and in the course of the person's employment.  This section does
not prevent a person less than 21 years of age from knowingly transporting
alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle if a person at least 21 years of age is
present inside the motor vehicle.  A person who violates this subsection is
guilty of a misdemeanor.  As part of the sentence, the person may be ordered to
perform community service and undergo substance abuse screening and assessment
as his or her own expense as described in section 703(1) of the Michigan Liquor
Control Code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, M.C.L. 436.1703.
   (b)   Within 30 days after the conviction for a violation of subsection (a)
by the operator of a motor vehicle, which conviction has become final, the
arresting law enforcement officer or the officer's superior may make a
complaint before the court from which the warrant was issued. The complaint
shall be under oath and shall describe the motor vehicle in which alcoholic
liquor was possessed or transported by the operator, who is less than 21 years
of age, in committing the violation and requesting that the motor vehicle be
impounded as provided in this section. Upon the filing of the complaint, the
court shall issue to the owner of the motor vehicle an order to show cause why
the motor vehicle should not be impounded. The order to show cause shall fix a
date and time for a hearing, which shall not be less than 10 days after the
issuance of the order.  The order shall be served by delivering a true copy to
the owner not less than 3 full days before the date of hearing or, if the owner
cannot be located, by sending a true copy by certified mail to the last known
address of the owner. If the owner is a nonresident of the state, service may
be made upon the secretary of state as provided in M.C.L. 257.403.
   (c)   If the court determines upon the hearing of the order to show cause,
from competent and relevant evidence, that at the time of the commission of the
violation the motor vehicle was being driven by the person less than 21 years
of age with the express or implied consent or knowledge of the owner in
violation of subsection (a), and that the use of the motor vehicle is not
needed by the owner in the direct pursuit of the owner's employment or the
actual operation of the owner's business, the court may authorize the
impounding of the vehicle for a period of not less than 15 days or more than 30
days. The court's order authorizing the impounding of the vehicle shall
authorize a law enforcement officer to take possession without other process of
the motor vehicle wherever located and to store the vehicle in a public or
private garage at the expense and risk of the owner of the vehicle. The owner
of the vehicle may appeal the order to the circuit court and the provisions
governing the taking of appeals from judgments for damages apply to the appeal.
This section does not prevent a bona fide lienholder from exercising rights
under a lien.
   (d)   A person who knowingly transfers title to a motor vehicle for the
purpose of avoiding this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (e)   A law enforcement agency, upon determining that a person less than 18
years of age allegedly violated this section, shall notify the parent or
parents, custodian, or guardian of the person as to the nature of the violation
if the name of a parent, guardian or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by
the law enforcement agency. The notice required by this subsection shall be
made not later than 48 hours after the law enforcement agency determines that
the person who allegedly violated this section is less than 18 years of age and
may be made in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail.
   (f)   As used in this section, "alcoholic liquor" means that term as defined
in section 105 of the Michigan Liquor Control Code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, M.C.L.
436.1103, as amended from time to time.

410.06  VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION; IMPOUNDMENT.
   (a)   If a person is convicted under Section
410.04, the motor vehicle, if owned in whole by that person, may be ordered
impounded for not less than 30 days or more than 120 days from the date of
judgment. The order of impoundment shall include the implied consent of the
owner of the vehicle to the storage for insurance coverage purposes.
   (b)   An order of impoundment issued pursuant to subsection (a) is valid
throughout the State. Any peace officer may execute the impoundment order.
   (c)   The owner of a motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this section is
liable for expenses incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle, whether
or not the vehicle is returned to him or her.  The vehicle shall be returned to
the owner only if the owner pays the expenses for removal and storage. If
redemption is not made or the vehicle is not returned as provided in this
section within 30 days after the time set in the impoundment order for return
of the vehicle, the vehicle shall be considered an abandoned vehicle and
disposed of as provided in Section
410.04 (UTC Section 2.5a et seq.).
   (d)   Nothing in this section affects the rights of a conditional vendor,
chattel mortgagee or lessor of a motor vehicle registered in the name of
another person as owner who becomes subject to this act.
(Ord. 683.  Passed 9-29-99.) 
410.07  FORFEITURE OF VEHICLE OR RETURN TO LESSOR.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, and in addition to any
other penalty provided for in this act, the judgment of sentence for a
conviction for a violation of penalty provided for in this act, the judgment of
sentence for a conviction for a violation of Section 410.04 (UTC Section 5.15
et seq.) may require 1 of the following with regard to the vehicle used in the
offense if the defendant owns the vehicle in whole or in part or leases the
vehicle:
      (1)   Forfeiture of the vehicle if the defendant owns the vehicle in
whole or in part.
      (2)   Return of the vehicle to the lessor if the defendant leases the
vehicle.
   (b)   The vehicle may be seized pursuant to an order of seizure issued by
the court having jurisdiction upon a showing of probable cause that the vehicle
is subject to forfeiture or return to the lessor.
   (c)   The forfeiture of a vehicle is subject to the interest of the holder
of a  security interest who did not have prior knowledge of or consent to the
violation.
   (d)   Within 14 days after the defendant's conviction of a violation
described in subsection (a), the prosecuting attorney may file a petition with
the court for the forfeiture of the vehicle or to have the court order return
of a leased vehicle to the lessor.  The prosecuting attorney shall give notice
by first-class mail or other process to the defendant and his or her attorney,
to all owners of the vehicle and to any person holding a security interest in
the vehicle that the court may require forfeiture or return of the vehicle.
   (e)   If a vehicle is seized before disposition of the criminal proceedings,
a defendant who is an owner or lessee of the vehicle may move the court having
jurisdiction over the proceedings to require the seizing agency to file a lien
against the vehicle and to return the vehicle to the owner or lessee pending
disposition of the criminal proceedings. The court shall hear the motion within
7 days after the motion is filed. If the defendant establishes at the hearing
that he or she holds the legal title to the vehicle or that he or she has a
leasehold interest and that it is necessary for him or her or a member of his
or her family to use the vehicle pending the outcome of the forfeiture action,
the court shall order the seizing agency to return the vehicle to the owner or
lessee. If the court orders the return of the vehicle to the owner or lessee,
the court may order the defendant to post a bond and may also order the seizing
agency to file a lien against the vehicle.
   (f)   Within 14 days after notice by the prosecuting attorney is given under
subsection (d), the defendant, an owner, lessee, or holder of a security
interest may file a claim of interest in the vehicle with the court. Within 21
days after the expiration of the period for filing claims, but before or at
sentencing, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the legitimacy of any
claim, the extent of any co-owner's equity interest, the liability of the
defendant to any co-lessee, and whether to order the vehicle forfeited or
returned to the lessor. In considering whether to order forfeiture, the court
shall review the defendant's driving record to determine whether the defendant
has multiple convictions, under Section
410.04 (UTC Section 5.15 et seq.) or multiple suspensions, restrictions, or
denials under this section or any other ordinance or statute, or both. If the
defendant has multiple convictions under Section
410.04 (UTC Section 5.15 et seq.) or multiple suspensions, restrictions, or
denials under this section or any other ordinance or statute, or both, that
factor may weigh heavily in favor of forfeiture.
   (g)   If a vehicle is forfeited under this section, the unit of government
that seized the vehicle shall sell the vehicle and dispose of the proceeds in
the following order of priority:
      (1)   Pay any outstanding security interest of a secured party who did
not have prior knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.
      (2)   Pay the equity interest of a co-owner who did not have actual prior
knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.
      (3)   Satisfy any order of restitution entered in the prosecution for the
violation.
      (4)   Pay the claim of each person who shows that he or she is a victim
of the violation to the extent that the claim is not covered by an order of
restitution.
      (5)   Pay an outstanding lien against property that has been imposed by a
governmental unit.
      (6)   Pay the proper expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale,
including, but not limited to, expenses incurred during the seizure process and
expenses for maintaining custody of the property, advertising, and court costs.
      (7)   Return the balance to the owner.
   (h)   The court may order the defendant to pay to a co-lessee any liability
determined under subsection (f). The order may be enforced in the same manner
as a civil judgment.
   (i)   The return of a vehicle to the lessor under this section does not
affect or impair the lessor's rights or the defendant's obligations under the
lease.
   (j)   A person who knowingly conceals, sells, gives away, or otherwise
transfers or disposes of a vehicle with the intent to avoid forfeiture or
return of the vehicle to the lessor under this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days, or such
period allowed by law, or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.
   (k)   The failure of the court or prosecutor to comply with any time limit
specified in this section does not preclude the court from ordering forfeiture
of a vehicle or its return to a lessor, unless the court finds that the owner
or claimant suffered substantial prejudice as a result of that failure.
   (l)   The forfeiture provisions of this section do not preclude the
prosecuting attorney from pursuing a forfeiture proceeding under any other law
of this state or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this section.
(Ord. 683.  Passed 9-29-99.) 
410.08  RECKLESS DRIVING.
   (a)   Any person who drives any vehicle upon a highway or a frozen public
lake, stream, or pond, or other place open to the general public, including any
area designated for the parking of motor vehicles, within this City, in wilful
or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, is guilty of
reckless driving.
   (b)   Every person convicted of reckless driving shall be punished by
imprisonment in jail for a period of not more than 90 days, or such period
allowed by law, or by a fine of not more than $100.00, or both.
(Ord. 683.  Passed 9-29-99.)
410.09  UNMANNED TRAFFIC MONITORING DEVICES.
   (a)   As used in this section, an "unmanned traffic monitoring device" means
a photographic, video, or electronic digital camera and vehicle sensor
installed to work in conjunction with an official traffic control device to
automatically produce photographs, video, or digital images of each vehicle
which enters a traffic intersection in disregard of a red traffic signal.
   (b)   The City may contract with a vendor to provide and install necessary
equipment, but the City shall either purchase and hold title to the equipment
or pay a set amount pursuant to a lease. Under no circumstances shall any
vendor be compensated based on a contingent fee related to the number of
citations issued or revenues generated.
   (c)   The City shall implement a plan for the fair use of such equipment to
assure that the rights of citizens are protected. Such a plan shall include,
but not necessarily be limited to, supervision by the Judge of the 28th
District Court, the Chief of Police and the Department of Public Services in
consultation with engineers, prosecutors and other interested parties. The plan
shall include safeguards to prevent the tampering with the timing of traffic
lights to increase the number of violations.
   (d)   Prior to the operation of an unmanned monitoring device, the City
shall post signs at various locations on City streets to inform citizens that
intersections are being so monitored. Thirty days after the posting of the
signs, the owner of a vehicle shall be guilty of a civil infraction if he or
she drives a motor vehicle into an intersection after the signal has turned red
as shown by photographic evidence obtained by the unmanned monitoring device.
   (e)   A sworn statement by a Southgate Police Officer or a person appointed
by the Judge of the 28th District Court shall be prima facie evidence of the
facts contained in the sworn statement. Any photographs, videotape, or digital
images evidencing the violation shall be available for inspection in a
proceeding to adjudicate the liability for a violation of this section.  All
such evidence shall be destroyed one year after final disposition of the
citation.
   (f)   In the prosecution of any violation of this section, prima facie
evidence that the vehicle described in the citation was operated in violation
of this section together with proof that the defendant or defendants were at
the time of the violation the registered owner or owners of the vehicle,
constitutes a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner or owners of the
vehicle were operating the vehicle when the violation occurred. This
presumption may be rebutted if the registered owner of the vehicle files an
affidavit by regular mail with the Clerk of the Court that he or she was not
the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or testifies
in open court under oath that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at
the time of the alleged violation. The presumption also may be rebutted if a
certified copy of a police report, showing that the vehicle was reported to the
police as stolen before the time of the alleged violation of this section is
presented to the court before the return date established on the citation.
   (g)   A citation for a violation of this section may be delivered to the
owner or owners of the vehicle as shown in the records of the Secretary of
State by first-class mail. If the summoned person fails to appear, the citation
shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the summoned
person fails to appear in response to the certified mail, the Court may issue a
bench warrant to cause the appearance of the summoned person.
   (h)   No points shall be assessed on the driving record of a person for a
violation of this section.
   (i)   The owner of a motor vehicle shall not be responsible for a violation
of this section if he or she can show by a preponderance of the evidence one of
the following:
      (1)   The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and
sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person;
      (2)   The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the
lawful order or direction of a police officer;
      (3)   The operator of the motor vehicle was part of a funeral procession;
      (4)   The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the
traffic-control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately
approaching authorized emergency vehicle; or
      (5)   The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency
vehicle operating in compliance with Michigan law.
   (j)   The civil fines to be assessed under this section shall be set by
resolution of the City Council. The Judge of the 28th District Court may also
levy costs in addition to the fines determined by Council.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 5-3-06.)
410.99  PENALTY.
   Any provision of this Chapter, including the Uniform Traffic Code adopted

nine feet, except as provided for on routes designated and approved by the
State Transportation Department and by local authorities with respect to
highways under their jurisdiction on which a person may operate a combination
of a truck tractor and two semitrailers with no limit on the overall
combination length, if the length of each semitrailer or trailer, including
load, does not exceed twenty-eight and one-half feet. The State Transportation
Department and local authorities, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate highways where the overall length of a truck and
trailer or semitrailer shall not exceed sixty-five feet.  A truck tractor and
semitrailer combination with a semitrailer length longer than fifty feet shall
not be allowed to operate with more than two axles on the semitrailer.  All
truck tractor and semitrailer combinations with a semitrailer length longer
than fifty feet shall travel exclusively on highways designated by the
appropriate road authority.  The City shall have the option of prohibiting
stops within its jurisdiction, unless the stop occurs along appropriately
designated routes, or is necessary for emergency purposes or to reach shippers,
receivers, warehouses and terminals along designated routes.  A trailer or
semitrailer in actual and lawful use in this State on December 1, 1982, may be
operated in this State for the life of the vehicle in a combination with other
vehicles in actual and lawful use in this State on December 1, 1982, if the
combination was of legal length under the laws of this State on December 1,
1982, and if the combination was of legal length under the laws of this State
immediately preceding January 24, 1984.  In calculating the length of a trailer
or semitrailer under this paragraph, the length shall be based on the cargo-
carrying portion of the vehicle only, including load.  A truck tractor or other
motor vehicle shall not haul more than one trailer and semitrailer or more than
two semitrailers in combination at any one time, except that a farm tractor may
haul two wagons or trailers, or garbage and refuse haulers may, during daylight
hours, haul up to four trailers for garbage and refuse collection purposes, not
exceeding, in any combination, a total length of fifty-five feet at a speed of
not to exceed fifteen miles per hour.  In determining the length of a vehicle
or a vehicle combination under this paragraph, the length shall not be
considered to include safety and energy conservation devices, including, but
not be limited to, impact absorbing bumpers, rear-view mirrors, turn signals,
lamps, marker lamps, steps and handholds for entry and egress, flexible fender
extensions, mud flaps or splash and spray suppressant devices; load induced
tire bulge; refrigeration or hearing units; or air compressors.  A device shall
be excluded from a determination of length only if it is not designed or used
for the carrying of cargo.

roads during these months shall be reduced by thirty-five percent from the
maximum axle loads as specified.  The maximum wheel load shall be 525 pounds
per inch of tire width on concrete and concrete base or 450 pounds per inch of
tire width on all other roads during the period the seasonal road restrictions
are in effect.
      (6)   The State Transportation Department, or the City, with respect to
highways under their respective jurisdictions, may suspend the restrictions
imposed by this subsection when and where, in their  discretion, conditions of
the highways or the public health, safety and welfare so warrant, and may
impose the restricted loading requirements of this subsection on designated
highways at any other time that the conditions of the highway may require.
      (7)   For the purpose of enforcement of this section, the gross vehicle
weight of a single vehicle and load or a combination of vehicles and loads,
shall be determined by weighing individual axles or groups of axles, and the
total weight on all axles shall be the gross vehicle weight. In addition, the
gross axle weight shall be determined by weighing individual axles or by
weighing a group of axles and dividing the gross weight of the group of axles
by the number of axles in the group.  Pursuant to paragraph (g)(8) hereof, the
overall gross weight on a group of two or more axles shall be determined by
weighing individual axles or several axles, and the total weight of all the
axles in the group shall be the overall gross weight of the group.
      (8)   The loading maximum provided in this subsection shall apply to
interstate highways, and the State Transportation Department, or the City with

axles equaling:
W + 500 LN + 12N = 36   W + 500 LN + 12 + 36
N-1   N-1
where W equals the overall gross weight on a group of two or more consecutive
axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L equals the distance in feet between the
extreme of a group of two or more consecutive axles, and N equals the number of
axles in the group under consideration, except that two consecutive sets of
tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each if the first and last
axles are not less than thirty-six feet apart. The gross vehicle weight shall
not exceed 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances.  Except for
five-axle truck tractor, semitrailer combinations having two consecutive sets
of tandem axles, vehicles having a gross weight in excess of 80,000 pounds or
in excess of the vehicle gross weight determined by application of the formula
provided in this paragraph, shall be subject to the maximum axle loads of
paragraphs (g)(1), (2) or (3) hereof.  As used in this paragraph, "tandem axle
weight" means the total weight transmitted to the road by two or more
consecutive axles, the centers of which may be included between parallel
transverse vertical planes spaced more than 409 inches, but not more than

   (j)   Stopping of Vehicles for Weighing; Overweight Vehicles; Failure to
Stop.
      (1)   A police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and load is unlawful may require the driver to stop and submit to a
weighing of the vehicle by either portable or stationary scales approved and
sealed by the Department of Agriculture as a legal weighing device, and may
require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest weighing station of the City
or its designated weighing station for the purpose of allowing an officer to
determine whether the conveyance is loaded in conformity with this chapter.
      (2)   When the officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, the officer may require the driver to stop the vehicle
in a suitable place and remain standing until that portion of the load is
shifted or removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle weight of the vehicle
to the limit permitted under this section.  All material unloaded as provided
under this paragraph shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle
at the risk of the owner or operator.  A judge or magistrate imposing a civil
fine and costs under this subsection, which are not paid in full immediately,
or for which a bond is not immediately posted in double the amount of the civil
fine and costs, shall order the driver or owner to move the vehicle at the
driver's own risk to a place of safekeeping within the jurisdiction of the
judge or magistrate, to inform the judge or magistrate, in writing, of the
place of safekeeping, and to keep the vehicle until the fine and costs are paid
or sufficient bond is furnished, or until the judge or magistrate is satisfied
that the fine and costs will be paid. The officer who has determined, after
weighing a vehicle and load, that the weight is unlawful, may require the
driver to proceed to a judge or magistrate within the City. If the judge or
magistrate is satisfied that the probable civil fine and costs will be paid by
the owner or lessee, the judge or magistrate may allow the driver to proceed,
after the load is made legal.  If the judge or magistrate is not satisfied that
the owner or lessee, after a notice and a right to be heard on the merits is
given, will pay the amount of the probable civil fine and costs, the judge or
magistrate may order the vehicle to be impounded until a trial on the merits is
completed under conditions set forth in this subsection for the impounding of
vehicles after the civil fine and costs have been imposed.
      Removal of the vehicle, and forwarding care or preservation of the load,
shall be under the control of and at the risk of the owner or driver.  Vehicles
impounded shall be subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona fide lien
of prior record, in the amount of the civil fine and costs, and if the civil
fine and costs are not paid within ninety days after the seizure, the judge or
magistrate shall certify the unpaid judgment to the City Attorney, who shall
proceed to enforce the lien by a foreclosure sale in accordance with the
procedure authorized in the case of a chattel mortgage foreclosure.
      (3)   An owner of a vehicle, a lessee of the vehicle of an owner-
operator,  or other person, who causes or allows a vehicle to be loaded and
driven or moved on a highway, when the weight of that vehicle is in violation
of subsection (g) hereof, is responsible for a civil infraction and shall pay a
civil fine in an amount equal to three cents ($0.03) per pound for each pound
of excess load over 1,000 pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; six
cents ($0.06) per pound of excess load when the excess is over 2,000 pounds but
not more than three thousand 3,000 pounds; nine cents ($0.09) per pound for
each pound of excess load when the excess is over 3,000 pounds but not more
than (4,000) pounds; twelve cents ($0.12) per pound for each pound of excess
load when the excess is over 4,000 pounds but not more than 5,000 pounds;
fifteen cents ($0.15) per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess
is over 5,000 pounds but not more than 10,000 pounds; and twenty cents ($0.20)
per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 10,000 pounds. 
However, the court shall have discretionary power as to the amount of the civil
fine within the schedule provided by this paragraph, and may impose the civil
fine provided in Section 907(3) of the Michigan Motor Vehicle Act (M.C.L.A.
257.907(3)), which is hereby adopted by reference, for a civil infraction
where, at the time of the violation, either the motor vehicle and semitrailer
or trailer did not exceed the total weight which would be lawful for each unit
by a proper distribution of the load upon the various axles supporting each
unit.
      (4)   A driver or owner, or both, of a vehicle, truck or truck tractor,
truck or truck tractor with other vehicles in combination, or special mobile
equipment, who knowingly fails to stop at or who knowingly bypasses any scales
or weighing station, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the
penalty provided in Section
422.99(a).
      (5)   A driver or owner, or both, of a vehicle, who knowingly fails to
stop when requested or ordered to do so by a police officer authorized to
require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle and load by
means of a portable scale, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to
the penalty provided in Section
422.99(a).
   (k)   Special Permits for Nonconforming Vehicles.
      (1)   The City, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, upon
application, in writing, and good cause being shown, may issue a special

the operation of which upon a highway would otherwise be prohibited under this
section.
      (4)   A permit shall specify the trip or trips and the date or dates for
which it is to be valid, and the City may restrict or prescribe conditions of
operation of the vehicle or vehicles, if necessary, to protect the safety of
the public or to insure against undue damage to the road foundations,
structures or installations, and may require a reasonable inspection fee and
other security as may be considered necessary to compensate for damage caused
by the movement.  A permit may be issued on an annual basis.
      (5)   A person may transport telephone, telegraph or electric poles, of a
greater length than otherwise authorized, over the highways in the
construction, maintenance or repair of telephone, telegraph or electric lines,
if a permit to do so is first secured from the City.
      (6)   A person may transport concrete pipe, of a greater width than
otherwise authorized, over highways, if a permit for each project is first
secured from the City.

vehicles for which insurance is in effect, shall state the name of each person
named on the policy, policy declaration or a declaration certificate whose

   If an owner of a motor vehicle is determined to be responsible for a
violation of Section
460.02, the court in which the civil infraction determination is entered may
require the person to surrender his or her operator's or chauffeur's license
unless proof that the vehicle has insurance meeting the requirements of Section
3102 of Act 218 of the Public Acts of 1956, as amended, is submitted to the
court.  If the court requires the license to be surrendered, the court shall
order the Secretary of State to suspend the person's license and shall forward
the surrendered license and a certificate of civil infraction to the Secretary
of State.  Upon receipt of the certificate of civil infraction and the
surrendered license, the Secretary of State shall suspend the person's license
beginning with the date on which a person is determined to be responsible for
the civil infraction for a period of thirty days or until proof of insurance
which meets the requirements of Section 3102 of Act 218 of the Public Acts of
1956, as amended, is submitted to the Secretary of State, whichever occurs
later.  If the license is not forwarded, an explanation of the reason why it is
not forwarded shall be attached.  A person who submits proof of insurance to
the Secretary of State under this section shall pay a service fee of ten
dollars ($10.00) to the Secretary of State.

468.05  PREFERENTIAL PARKING DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following words and
phrases are defined and shall be construed as hereinafter set forth, unless it
shall be apparent from the context that they have a different meaning:
      (1)   "Guest" shall mean a person who is visiting a dwelling unit located
in a preferential parking district.
      (2)   "Merchant" shall mean the owner of a business legally operating
within a preferential parking district.
      (3)   "Nonlocal vehicle" shall mean a motor vehicle parked in a
residential area which is not owned, leased or otherwise controlled by a
"resident," a "merchant" or a "guest," as such terms are defined in this
section.
      (4)   "Permit Parking Administrator" shall be an individual duly
appointed by the Chief of Police to administer all provisions set forth herein.
      (5)   "Preferential parking district" shall mean a residential area with
streets and boundaries designated by a City Council resolution wherein vehicles
displaying a valid permit shall be exempt from parking restrictions established
pursuant to this section.
      (6)   "Resident" shall mean a person who lives in a dwelling unit located
within the boundaries of a preferential parking district.
   (b)   Parking Privileges for Permit Holders.  Any motor vehicle displaying a
valid preferential parking permit for a street within a preferential parking
district may park on that street during the hours when parking on such street
is prohibited to non-permitted vehicles. A preferential parking permit shall
neither guarantee nor reserve to the holder thereof any particular on-street
parking space. A permitted vehicle shall obey all other parking rules,
regulations and restrictions.
   (c)   Designation Power and Criteria.  A preferential parking district shall
be created only where the City Council has found that unrestricted parking by
nonlocal vehicles creates a situation in which the streets cannot be used for
parking by the residents or their guests and that such unrestricted parking
substantially, unreasonably and regularly interferes with the use of a majority
of the available public street parking, is the source of unreasonable noise,
traffic hazards, environmental pollution or of other interference with the
residential environment, and detrimentally affects the public welfare.
   (d)   Designation of Preferential Parking District.  Preferential parking
districts may only be designated or dissolved by a City Council resolution. The
City Council shall consider for designation as preferential parking districts
those areas satisfying the criteria provided for in subsection (c) hereof.  If
the Council determines that the criteria have been met, it may establish, by
resolution, preferential parking districts with appropriate boundaries, time
restrictions, and other appropriate rules, regulations, or restrictions.
   (e)   Installation of Signs.  The preferential parking designation shall not
apply to any specific street within the district until a sign giving adequate
notice thereof has been installed on that street. The Permit Parking
Administrator will cause the installation of such signs on the streets in
preferential parking districts, in an order and timing in his or her discretion
according to sound traffic engineering principles, indicating that there is no
parking between specified hours except for vehicles which display a valid
preferential parking permit.
   (f)   Establishment and Enforcement of Hours.  Preferential parking
referenced in this section shall be in effect and enforced on such days of the
week and during such time periods as shall be determined by City Council
resolution, and shall be prominently posted on signs erected within such
preferential parking districts. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
allowing permit parking during times or hours, or by type of vehicle otherwise
prohibited in this title or by any provision of the Code of Ordinances of the
City of Southgate or the Michigan Vehicle Code.
   (g)   Exemptions.  The vehicles listed in this section may park in a
preferential parking district without a preferential parking permit; therefore,
subsection (c) hereof shall not apply to any of the following: vehicles
lawfully displaying a special identification license plate or placard issued to
a disabled person; vehicles of disabled veterans, emergency vehicles and other
vehicles explicitly exempted from observing parking regulations pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Michigan Vehicle Code.
   (h)   Preferential Parking Permit-Application and Issuance.  The Permit
Parking Administrator shall issue preferential parking permit applications and
shall issue permits, by street or streets, upon proper application therefor.
Permits shall be issued only as follows: Annual permits shall be issued for
passenger vehicles, pick-up trucks and vans but only upon application of a
resident or merchant who is the currently registered owner. Each application
and reapplication shall be on a form provided by the Permit Parking
Administrator and shall contain sufficient information to satisfy the director
as to the identity and qualifying address of the applicant, the applicant's
registered ownership, the license number of the vehicle and proof of current
registration. No more than one annual permit shall be issued for each vehicle
for which application is made unless reapplication is made and proof is
provided, to the satisfaction of the Permit Parking Administrator, that an
issued permit was lost, stolen or destroyed. No more than three annual permits
shall be issued to any dwelling unit or merchant at any point in time. The
Permit Parking Administrator may withhold issuing any permit for a vehicle for
which there is evidence of any outstanding, unpaid parking violation. Permits
shall be issued, denied or conditionally issued within thirty days of
application. Any person wishing to contest a denial must do so in writing to
the Permit Parking Administrator within ten days of the date of the
notification of denial, setting forth all the facts which the permit holder
wishes the Permit Parking Administrator to consider, and a decision thereon
shall be made by the Permit Parking Administrator within fifteen days of
receipt.
   (i)   Guest Permits.  Upon application, the Permit Parking Administrator
shall issue up to three, annual guest permits to every residential dwelling
unit located within the boundaries of a preferential parking district. No guest
permits shall be issued to merchants. An annual guest permit is transferable,
without restriction, among guests. No more than three such annual permits shall
be issued to any residential dwelling unit unless reapplication is made and
proof is provided, to the satisfaction of the Permit Parking Administrator,
that an issued permit was lost, stolen or destroyed. In addition to the annual
guest permits, and upon application by a resident, the Permit Parking
Administrator may issue dated, one-day guest passes to residents on a special
event basis.
   (j)   Other Preferential Parking Permits.  The Permit Parking Administrator
shall receive applications for preferential parking permits from duly
authorized representatives of organizations, professions or other designated
groups with real property interests within the preferential parking district
where the Permit Parking Administrator determines, based upon sound engineering
principles, traffic investigation and/or surveys made from time to time, that
such permits will further the objectives of this section and will not adversely
affect parking conditions for residents and merchants within the district.
Permits shall be issued on payment of fees established by resolution of the
City Council, in numbers consistent with the determination of the director and
on certification by applicant of compliance with this section and all
applicable laws, rules and regulations. Permits shall be issued, denied or
conditionally issued within thirty days of application. Any person wishing to
contest a denial must do so in writing to the Permit Parking Administrator
within ten days of the date of the notification of denial, setting forth all
the facts which the applicant wishes the Permit Parking Administrator to
consider, and a decision thereon shall be made within fifteen days of receipt.
   (k)   Permit Content.  Each preferential parking permit shall state the
street or streets on which it is valid, the expiration date and any additional
information required by the Permit Parking Administrator.
   (l)   Permit Application and Terms.
      (1)   Each preferential parking permit and guest permit issued pursuant
to this section shall be issued on an annual basis, and each such permit shall
expire twelve months following its issuance.
      (2)   Each application, reapplication and renewal application shall be
made and considered in the manner set forth in this section, as applicable, for
permit type.
   (m)   Permit Display.  Preferential parking permits, except for guest
permits, shall be permanently, visibly affixed to the left inside rear window
of the vehicle for which it is issued, and the permit shall not be effective
unless it is so affixed. Guest permits shall be visibly displayed on the
driver's side of the dashboard so as to be readily visible through the
vehicle's windshield.
   (n)   Permit Revocation.  The Permit Parking Administrator may revoke the
permit of any permittee under any of the following grounds: ineligibility for a
permit under the terms of this section at the time of the application; ceasing
to be eligible during the term of the permit; failing to comply with or
violating any condition imposed on the issuance of a permit; or failing to
comply with or violating the requirements of this section or any related law or
regulation. Written notification shall be given to the permittee stating
grounds for revocation and requesting surrender of the permit. Except as set
forth below, the permit shall be considered void on the sixth day after the
date of notification. Any person whose permit has been revoked shall not be
issued a new permit without reapplication and establishing eligibility pursuant
to this section to the reasonable satisfaction of the Permit Parking
Administrator. Anyone wishing to contest a revocation must do so, in writing,
and cause it to be filed with the Permit Parking Administrator within five days
of the date of the notification of revocation, setting forth all the facts
which the permit holder wishes the Permit Parking Administrator to consider,
and a decision thereon shall be made within fifteen days of receipt. If such a
contest is timely filed, revocation shall be stayed until the Permit Parking
Administrator's decision is made.

shall be fined an amount established by Violations Bureau of the 28th District

Further, it is the intent of the City to afford dog owners due process when the

section, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them below:
      (1)   “Animal review official” means the animal control officer. If the
animal control officer is not available, the Chief of Police shall designate
the official to conduct the investigations under this section.
      (2)   “Authorized enforcement officer” means a police officer or animal
control officer.
      (3)   “City” means the City of Southgate.
      (4)   “Dangerous dog” means a dog that bites or attacks a person or

while the other dog or domestic animal is on the property or under the control
of its owner. However, a dangerous dog does not include any of the following:
         A.   A dog that bites or attacks a person who is knowingly trespassing
on the property of the dog's owner;
         B.   A dog that bites or attacks a person who provokes or torments the
dog; or
         C.   A dog that is responding in a manner that an ordinary and
reasonable person would conclude was designed to protect a person if that
person is engaged in a lawful activity or is the subject of an assault.
      (5)   “Enclosure” means secure confinement indoors or secure confinement
in a locked pen, a structure with secure sides, top and bottom, or a yard which
is suitable to prevent the entry of young children, and is designed to prevent
the dog from escaping from the owner's property.
      (6)   “Owner” means any person, firm, corporation or organization that
owns, possesses, harbors, keeps, or has an interest in, or has control or
custody of the dog.
      (7)   “Potentially dangerous dog” means a dog that poses a threat to
public safety as demonstrated by any of the following behaviors:
         A.   Causing an injury to a person or domestic animal that is less

agency three or more times within any twelve-month period.

owner of the dog. In the event that the animal review official or police
officer personally observes a potentially dangerous dog then he shall serve a
municipal civil infraction upon the owner of the dog.
      (2)   Upon entry of a judgment on the civil infraction if the owner does

threat to public safety; or failure to comply with any special security or care
requirements for a potentially dangerous dog that the animal review official
may determine is necessary for public safety.
   (d)   Determination of a Dangerous Dog.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a complaint and after conducting an investigation,

complaint if he determines the dog to be dangerous.

other means, the Chief Animal Control Officer shall notify the owner about the
animal’s impoundment by first class mail or telephone. The Chief Animal Control
Officer shall inform the owner of the steps necessary to regain custody of the

chapter.
         E.   The Chief Animal Control Officer shall not knowingly adopt an
animal to a person who has been convicted of animal cruelty, abandonment,
neglect or other related criminal violations of state law or of this ordinance
without a court order. The Chief Animal Control Officer may decline to adopt an
animal if other circumstances exist, which, in the opinion of the Chief Animal
Control Officer would endanger the health, safety, or welfare of people or
animals.
   (e)   Quarantine of Animal.
      (1)   The owner of any domesticated companion animal that bites a person
or other animal shall immediately quarantine the biting animal for a minimum of
ten days at the Downriver Central Animal Shelter or may be approved for home
quarantine which is at the sole discretion of the animal control officer. If
the owner of the biting animal fails to surrender the animal, a daily violation
shall be issued until the animal is placed under quarantine, or if the owner of
the biting animal cannot be identified or found, then the Chief Animal Control
Officer may take possession of the domesticated companion animal and quarantine
it at the Animal Control Shelter or Animal Protection Shelter until the
expiration of the ten-day period. The owner shall be responsible for all
expenses incurred for the quarantine. At the expiration of the ten-day period,
if the owner shows satisfactory evidence that the domesticated companion animal
is not suffering from rabies, and pays the requisite expenses, the Chief Animal
Control Officer shall release the domesticated companion animal to its owner.
Any violation of the home quarantine agreement or failure to bring the animal
to the Animal Shelter or veterinarian in the required time is in violation of
this chapter. The Chief Animal Control Officer may immediately humanely destroy
the domesticated companion animal that has bitten if the animal is determined
by a veterinarian to be suffering from rabies or upon request of the owner. In
such cases, following the humane destruction of the domesticated companion
animal, the Chief Animal Control Officer shall immediately send a sample
specimen to the Michigan Department of Public Virology Laboratory in Lansing,
Michigan.
      (2)   Animals that are not domesticated. If an animal that is not
domesticated bites a person or other animal, and there is no identifiable
owner, then the Chief Animal Control Officer shall if possible, humanely
confine for quarantine and/or destroy the animal and immediately send the
animal or sample specimen to the Michigan Department of Public Health Virology
Laboratory in Lansing, Michigan.
      (3)   Violation of quarantine. It is a violation of quarantine to allow a
dog to run at large during the dates of a mandated quarantine following the
possibility of exposure to rabies, failing to quarantine the dog as required by
the home observation agreement or surrender the dog as required by the Animal
Control Officer at the Animal Shelter or a veterinarian’s office.

the responsible party contests the assessed charges; he or she may request an
opportunity to appear before City Council to further request a modification of
the assessable costs. A responsible party who desires to appear before City
Administrator must first meet with the City Administrator or his/her designee,
as provided above, and shall file a written request to appear before City
Council with the City Clerk within seven calendar days of the meeting with the
City Administrator.
   (c)   Upon receipt of a request to appear before City Council, the City
Clerk will place the challenge to the assessed cost on the agenda of the next
regularly-scheduled City Council meeting, as long as there are at least
fourteen calendar days after the date on which the responsible party files the
request to appear.
   (d)   The filed request to appear before City Council shall specifically
identify and explain all reasons why the responsible party believes the
assessed costs should be modified.  The responsible party has the burden of
proving by a preponderance of relevant facts that the determination is
erroneous in whole or in part. Any reasoning, basis or argument for
modification of assessable costs not set forth in the request to appear before
City Council shall be deemed waived by the responsible party. Failure to timely
file a written request to appear before City Council shall constitute a waiver
of the responsible party's right to appear before City Council and shall
further constitute the responsible party's agreement to pay the assessable
costs invoiced.
   (e)   Once the responsible party has been given the opportunity to appear
before it, City Council shall within a reasonable time, affirm, reverse, or
modify all or a portion of the payment of the assessable costs invoiced.
Failure of the responsible party to appear before City Council on the appeal
shall constitute a waiver of that party's objections to the assessable costs.
The decision of City Council shall be final.
(Ord. 903.  Passed 5-5-10.)
632.07  ASSESSABLE COSTS CONSTITUTE A LIEN UPON PROPERTY.
   Any assessable costs which have been assessed but not paid when due,
including any late payment fees, shall constitute a lien upon the real property
of the responsible party in the City, from which, upon which or related to
which an extraordinary situation occurred. Such a lien shall be of the
character and effect as the lien created by State statute for General Tax Law
for City real property and shall include accrued interest and penalties. The
City Treasurer shall verify on March 1 of each year and certify to the City
Assessor the fact that such assessable costs are delinquent and unpaid. The
City Assessor shall then enter the delinquent amount on the next general ad
valorem tax roll as a charge against the affected property, and the lien
thereon shall be enforced in the same manner as provided and allowed by law for
delinquent and unpaid real property taxes.
(Ord. 903.  Passed 5-5-10.)
632.08  OTHER REMEDIES.
   In addition to the remedy set forth in Section
632.07, the City shall be entitled to pursue any other remedy or may institute
any appropriate court action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction
as permitted by law to collect assessable costs from a responsible party.
(Ord. 903.  Passed 5-5-10.)
632.09  NO LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   The recovery of assessable costs pursuant to this chapter does not limit the
liability of a responsible party under applicable Federal, State or local law.
(Ord. 903.  Passed 5-5-10.)
632.10  PREEMPTION BY FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a Federal or State
statute from preempting this chapter if the Federal or State statute provides
an absolute defense to liability of a responsible party due to the acts of a
third party and that statue expressly or impliedly provides the Federal or
State government with the authority to regulate the specific area of the law,
or the pervasiveness of Federal or State regulation or the nature of the
regulation demonstrates the need for exclusive regulation by the Federal or
State government, including, but not limited to NREPA, MCLA 323.101, et seq.
and CERCLA 42 USC 9601, et seq.

   (a)   No permit shall be revoked except for cause upon proof of charges

violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, which violation injuriously
or adversely affects the public health, safety or comfort; or that this chapter
has been violated in connection with work for which the permittee was
responsible and of which the permittee was aware, or in the exercise of
reasonable diligence should have been aware that such violation had occurred;
or that the permittee has been convicted of any crime which was perpetrated on
or in connection with the premises covered by such permit; or that such
permittee has carried on or permitted to be carried on any unlawful or illegal
act on or in connection with such premises covered by such permit. Upon the
filing of such charges with the Director of Inspections or the Director of
Public Services, the permit involved shall be suspended forthwith and the
permittee shall be given a notice of such suspension, together with a copy of
the charges specifying the facts on which the suspension was made. At the same
time such copy of the charges is given to the permittee or his or her agent in
charge of the premises, an order shall be served upon such permittee or agent,
signed by the Director of Inspections or the Director of Public Services,
directing such permittee to appear before the Board of Health at a date and
place therein specified, which date shall occur not more than ten days from the
day of such suspension, to show cause why the permit suspended should not be
permanently revoked.  (Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Upon the filing of such charges, the permit suspended shall be
surrendered and held until such time as there has been a determination of
whether or not such permit should be revoked as hereinafter provided. The Board
is hereby authorized to investigate the charges set forth in the notice of
suspension, subpoena, swear and examine witnesses and receive other competent
evidence in connection therewith, offered either by the person making the
charges or by the permittee, or the Board, on its own motion, may make such
investigation of facts as it deems necessary. The permittee shall be entitled
to be represented by counsel. The decision of the Board shall be final and
binding as to all questions of fact. If the Board finds as a result of such
investigation, that the permittee failed or refused to show cause, or has not
shown sufficient cause, why his or her permit should not be revoked, or if the
Board finds that that such suspension was for a violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter, or that any facts have been shown which constitute
grounds for suspending a permit under this chapter, the Board may order such
permit permanently revoked or revoked for such period of time as the Board
deems necessary. If the Board finds that the charges on which the permit was

660.11  CONDEMNATION OR VACATION OF UNFIT PREMISES; COSTS.
   (a)   If the Director of Inspections is satisfied, upon examination, that a
building, tenement, room or cellar in the City which is occupied as a dwelling
place, or any other place where human beings reside, congregate, work or have
access to, has become, by reason of its being inhabited or used, unclean or
unfit for use as herein stated, or is likely to become a nuisance as herein
declared or to be the cause of sickness to tenants, occupants or persons who
have access to the place, the Director shall give notice, in writing, to the
occupant or owner of the premises, or post such notice in a conspicuous
location upon the entrance of such premises, condemning the place as being
unfit for human habitation or use, and shall demand the occupant or owner of
the premises to put such place in a sanitary and habitable condition within a
reasonable time as therein stated.
      If such occupant or owner fails or refuses to comply with the terms of
such notice within the time specified, the Director may declare the premises a
nuisance and make and file a complaint against such occupant or owner, or both,
as herein provided, cause the condition of the premises to be corrected at the
owner's expense or do whatever is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance at
the expense of the owner.
   (b)   The reasonable cost and expense incurred by the Director in repairing
such premises and abating such nuisance shall be determined by the Director,
and the amount thus determined shall be charged to the owner of the premises
involved and shall be due and payable forthwith. A bill covering such amount
shall be mailed by the City Treasurer to the owner of such premises at his or
her last known post office address, demanding payment of the amount due. If
such amount is not paid to the City on or before December 21 of the calendar

   (c)   If such premises are vacated, the Director may, in his or her
discretion, refuse to permit and condemn the use of any premises for human
habitation declared by him or her to be a nuisance, and such premises shall not
again be occupied as a human habitation until they are put in a sanitary and
habitable condition. The Director is hereby authorized to condemn any premises
declared by him or her to be a nuisance which are occupied as a residence by
any tenant or lessee and may order such premises vacated until repaired or
until the conditions are corrected to make them habitable.
660.12  OCCUPANCY OF CONDEMNED PREMISES PROHIBITED.

Director.

660.14  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLEANLINESS OF PREMISES.
   All persons who own, manage, lease, rent or occupy any premises whatsoever
shall be equally responsible for keeping such premises in a clean and habitable
condition and shall take all necessary precautions to prevent any nuisance as
herein declared or other condition detrimental to public health from arising
thereon, and particularly shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent
rodents and vermin, including rats, bedbugs and cockroaches, from being
attracted thereto or existing thereon.
(1974 Code Sec. 9.16)
660.15  RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF DWELLINGS.
   Every building or portion thereof which is being used as a dwelling, home or
residence shall be kept by the owner or landlord thereof in a clean, neat and
habitable condition in order to prevent the premises from becoming a nuisance.
No owner or landlord shall allow a dwelling to become dilapidated, permit weeds
or other vegetation to grow higher than eight inches in height or allow trash,
rubbish or refuse to accumulate on the property to such an extent that a
nuisance is created which is injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the
occupants of the dwelling or of the inhabitants of the City. Storage of wood
piles for burning purposes shall be elevated a minimum of twelve inches off the
ground and stored in the rear yard.
   If the owner has leased or rented the dwelling to another person and the
duty to keep the premises in a proper condition rests upon such renter, tenant
or lessee, then the obligations of this chapter shall fall upon such renter,
tenant or lessee.  However, if the renter, tenant or lessee neglects their
duty, the responsibility reverts to the owner or landlord to keep the dwelling,
home or residence clean, neat and in a habitable condition in order to prevent
the premises from becoming a nuisance.
(1974 Code Sec. 9.17; Ord. 344.  Passed 7-1-81; Ord. 16-976.  Passed 11-2-16;
Ord. 17-989.  Passed 3-15-17.)
660.16  MAINTENANCE OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.
   (a)   The owner or other person legally responsible shall have the duty to
maintain any commercial or industrial building in a neat, clean and
structurally sound manner and to prevent the premises, including the adjacent
public right of way, from becoming littered or a nuisance, as defined by State
law. The owner or other person in charge shall keep the building free from all
signs or posters not specifically authorized by such owner or person in charge
and permitted by applicable sign provisions of these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   This section shall be equally applicable to empty or unrented
buildings, and in the case of vacant buildings, such buildings shall be kept
securely locked at all times.
   (c)   The owner of a vacant building shall, within thirty days of such
building becoming vacant, board up the windows with wood or some other suitable
material and paint such portion of material visible from the outside white or a
color compatible with the outside wall surface, or shall cover the windows with
a white substance or material so as to effectively prevent viewing into the
vacant property from the outside.
(1974 Code Sec. 9.18; Ord. 278.  Passed 10-25-78.)
660.17  NOTICE TO REMEDY PROHIBITED CONDITIONS.

notify the owner of the property of such condition and require that it be
remedied within ten days. Such notice may be given in person or by registered
mail, addressed to the last known address of the owner.
660.18  COSTS OF REMEDYING PROHIBITED CONDITIONS; LIENS.
   If the owner fails to remedy a prohibited condition after notice by the
Director of Inspections or the Director of Public Services, the Director of
Public Services shall thereupon remedy the condition or abate the nuisance or
cause the same to be done by personnel of the City or outside personnel, if
necessary. Upon completion of such work, the Director of Public Services shall
determine the reasonable cost thereof and bill the owner therefor. Upon failure
of the owner to remit to the City Treasurer the amount of such charge within
thirty days from the date of such notice, the amount of the bill shall be
certified to Council, who, pursuant to Section
157 of the City Charter, shall order such charges transferred to the
miscellaneous special assessment roll to become a lien upon the property, which
lien may be enforced in the any manner allowable under the law.
660.19  POWERS OF DIRECTOR OF INSPECTIONS RE NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   The Director of Inspections is hereby authorized at any time to order the

written notice to remove the graffiti within a period of three calendar days,
and provided that the three-day period has elapsed.
   (c)   Removal.  Whenever the Department of Public Services determines that
graffiti is located on public or private property so as to be capable of being
viewed by a person utilizing any public right of way, and the owner of the
property is informed of the necessity of removing the graffiti by the City, the
City shall be authorized to provide for the removal of the graffiti as follows:

of five percent until paid and satisfied in full.  The City shall also have the
right, but not the obligation, to sue the owner for any costs incurred by the
City.
      (3)   In the event that the owner of the property (real or personal)
shall not remove the graffiti within three days of being notified by the City,
the City may enter upon the property for the purpose of removing said graffiti,
which is deemed to be detrimental to the welfare and well being of the
community and to contribute, or tend to contribute, to the reduction of the
value of property in the surrounding area.  The owner shall repay the City as
provided for in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.

delivery thereof, provided the same was properly addressed to the last known
address of such owner, occupant or agent, the City Department of Public Works
and its authorized representatives are hereby empowered to enter upon such

respect to each parcel or property. The Director is also authorized to add to

administrating the work performed, overhead and other contingent expenses.
Within ten days after receipt of the certificate, the City Treasurer shall
forward a statement of the total charges assessed on each parcel of property to
the owner as shown by the last current assessment or tax roll, and said
assessment shall be payable to the City Treasurer within thirty days from the
date when the statement was forwarded. If not paid within the prescribed
thirty-day period, such statement shall be filed with the City Assessor and
shall thereupon be assessed against the land in question and become a lien on
such property in accordance with the provisions of the City Charter. The amount
so charged may be discharged at any time by the payment of the amount specified

computed from the time of filing said certificate with the City Assessor.

      (1)   Declare hours of curfew for all persons.  During the hours of

thousand dollars ($25,000) or a guaranty by a corporate parent of the grantee. 
The purpose of the letter of credit or guaranty is to guarantee the timely
construction and full initial activation of the cable system.  The letter of
credit shall be for the purpose of allowing recovery of any and all damages,
losses or costs suffered as a result of the failure of a grantee to
satisfactorily complete and fully activate and maintain the cable television
system.
   (b)   When the grantee can show to the satisfaction of the City that
energized trunk cable passes 100 percent of homes, the grantee shall file a
corporate surety bond ("the bond"), in an amount specified in the franchise, or
a guaranty by the corporate parent of a grantee, which shall be maintained for
the duration of the franchise to secure the grantee's obligations under the
franchise and the letter of credit may be terminated.
   (c)   The bond shall contain the following endorsement:
   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by
the surety, nor the intention not to renew be exercised by the surety, until
sixty days after receipt by the City, by registered mail, of a written notice
of such intent to cancel or not to renew."
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.08  RATES.
   (a)   Nothing contained in a franchise shall be construed to exempt a
grantee from any tax, levy or assessment which is now or hereafter may be
authorized by law.  With respect to rates and charges, the City and the grantee
shall abide by applicable State and Federal law and FCC Regulations.
   (b)   A grantee shall not discriminate in the assessment, levy, charge,
imposition or collection of rates and service charges on the basis of age,
race, creed, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status. Nothing
in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the reduction or waiving of
charges in conjunction with community promotional campaigns for the purpose of
attracting subscribers or users or entering into customized bulk and commercial
arrangements.
   (c)   If a subscriber or user fails to pay a rate or service charge as
properly due and owing, a grantee may discontinue service to the subscriber or
user upon giving ten days written notice.
   (d)   If a grantee collects a deposit or advance charge on any service or
equipment requested by a subscriber or user, the grantee shall provide such
service or equipment within thirty days of the collection of the deposit or
charge or it shall refund such deposit or charge within fifteen days. Nothing
in this subsection shall be construed:
      (1)   To relieve a grantee of any responsibility to subscribers or users
under any contractual agreements into which it enters with them;
      (2)   As limiting a grantee's liability for fines or penalties which may
be imposed under this chapter or any franchise for a violation or breach of any
of its provisions; or
      (3)   As limiting a grantee's liability for damages because of its
failure to provide the service for which the deposit or charge was made.
   (e)   In the event that a subscriber terminates any cable service prior to
the end of a pre-paid period, the immediately effective pro-rata portion of any
pre-paid rate which represents payment for services which are no longer to be
rendered shall be refunded.
   (f)   Any security deposit collected by a grantee shall be returned to the
subscriber upon termination of service by the subscriber and return of such
equipment undamaged, with allowance for reasonable wear and tear, and payment
of any outstanding balance due and payable.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.09  FRANCHISE FEE PAYMENTS.
   (a)   A grantee shall pay, for the use of City streets, public places and
other facilities, as well as for their maintenance, improvement and
supervision, a franchise fee, annually, in an amount set forth in the
franchise, not to exceed five percent of the grantee's gross annual revenue. 
Payments are due on or before March 31 for the preceding year, and so forth. 
Duly authorized representatives of the grantee shall furnish a certificate with
each payment reflecting the gross revenue, deductions and computations for the
period covered by the payment.  The computation of franchise fees shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as
established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
   (b)   The City may, from time to time and upon reasonable notice, inspect
and audit any and all books and records of the grantee relevant to the
determination of gross annual revenues and the computation of franchise fees
due, and may recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the
franchise. The reasonable cost of the audit will be borne by the grantee if, as
a result of the audit, the City determines that the grantee has underpaid the
franchise fees owed in an amount exceeding five percent of the franchise fees
actually paid.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.10  COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS; CONFLICTS OF LAW; OBLIGATIONS
OF GRANTEE.
   (a)   A grantee shall, at all times, comply with all laws and regulations of
the State and Federal governments or any administrative agency. However, if any
such State or Federal law or regulation shall require or permit a grantee to
perform any service or prohibit a grantee from performing any service, in
conflict with the terms of the franchise or of any law or regulation, then, as
soon as possible, a grantee shall notify the City of the point of conflict
believed to exist between such regulation or law and the laws or regulations of
the franchise.
   (b)   If any provision of the franchise is held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or State law, rule
or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court to be
modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any law, rule or
regulation, said provision may be considered a separate, distinct and
independent part of the franchise, and such holding shall not affect the
validity and enforceability of all other provisions. In the event that such
law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or
otherwise changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or
modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rule or regulation, said
provision shall return to full force and effect and shall be binding on the
parties.
   (c)   Upon execution of a franchise by a grantee, the grantee agrees to be
bound by all of its terms and conditions and accepts unconditionally the
franchise and promises to comply with and abide by all of its terms, provisions
and conditions.  The grantee also agrees to provide all services set forth in
its franchise to provide cable television services within the confines of the
City.  In addition, the grantee specifically agrees that this chapter is
incorporated by reference and made a part of the franchise.  In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of this chapter and the franchise, the
franchise shall prevail.

818.11  GENERAL CAPABILITIES.
   (a)   Should a grantee provide a video programming service to any other
downriver community, the grantee hereby agrees to provide the same video
programming service to subscribers in the City.  This requirement shall be
waived upon an affirmative demonstration by the grantee that such service would
be impractical or infeasible, or that substantial differences in circumstances
exist between the City and the other downriver communities.  Factors may
include population density, financial circumstances, disparate burdens
(regulatory or otherwise), etc., or any other relevant factors.
   (b)   A grantee's cable television system shall:
      (1)   Distribute in color and in stereo all television signals which it
so receives.
      (2)   Provide facilities, equipment and personnel for public, educational
and governmental access channels or a financial commitment as set forth in the
grantee's franchise.  The use of facilities and equipment, if any, for public,
educational and governmental access upon the cable television system shall be
made available, without rental or other like charges whatsoever in connection
with the production of public, educational and governmental access
programming.  The grantee making facilities and equipment available under a
franchise shall establish reasonable rules and procedures designed to promote
the utilization of public access to facilities and equipment, subject to the
approval and the discretion of the City.
   (c)   A grantee shall cooperate with the City on the use and operation of
the emergency alert override system.
   (d)   Every franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide for not
less than three channels, one each for public, educational and governmental
access use described in the grantee's franchise.
   (e)   This chapter shall not be construed to limit the authority of a
grantee to make voluntary payments in support of the use of public, educational
and governmental access channels.  However, such voluntary payments shall in no
event be considered in the calculation of franchise fees.
   (f)   A grantee shall make reasonable efforts to coordinate the cablecasting
of public, educational and governmental access programming upon the cable
television system.
   (g)   To the extent that it is technically and economically feasible, the

systems within the City and the greater area so as to enable each cable
television system to carry and cablecast the public, educational and
governmental access programming of the other cable television systems. 
Interconnection of cable television systems may be done by direct cable
connection, microwave link, satellite or other appropriate method.  A grantee
may not provide capacity on its system to transmit or receive cable television
signals from any separately owned adjacent cable system to residential
subscribers in another municipality without the express written permission of
the City.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.12  GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE.
   (a)   A grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television
system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the City, subject
to any service area or line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.
   (b)   After cable television service has been established by activating
trunk and/or distribution cables for any service area, and unless otherwise
provided in the franchise agreement or franchise renewal agreement, a grantee
shall provide cable television service to any requesting subscriber within that
service area within forty-five days from the date of request, provided that the
grantee is able to secure all rights of ways necessary to extend cable
television service to such subscriber within such forty-five-day period on
reasonable terms and conditions.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)

   (a)   Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable television system
shall file an application with the City, with reasonable contents for the
application to be determined by the City and the grantee.  Within sixty days
after receipt from the City of a written itemization, the grantee shall
reimburse the City for its reasonable costs, not to exceed twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000), incurred in connection with the granting of the franchise.
   (b)   A public hearing shall be set prior to any initial franchise grant at
a time and date approved by Council. Council shall make a decision as to
whether or not the franchise should be granted, and, if granted, as to what
conditions it should be subject to. Council may grant one or more franchises,
or may decline to grant any franchise.
   (c)   Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable Federal and
State law, if any.

representative on the next business day.
      (2)   Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a
company representative, including wait time, shall not exceed thirty seconds
when the connection is made. If the call needs to be transferred, transfer time
shall not exceed thirty seconds. These standards shall be met no less than

interruption" means the loss of picture or sound on one or more cable channels
affecting all subscribers.
         C.   The appointment window for installations, service calls and other
installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-
hour block during normal business hours. The grantee may schedule service calls
and other installation activities outside of normal business hours for the
express convenience of the customer.
         D.   A grantee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the
close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment.

         A.   The customer's next billing cycle following resolution of the
request or sixty days, whichever is earlier; or
         B.   The return of the equipment supplied by the grantee if service is
terminated.
      (9)   Credits will be issued no later than the two billing cycles
following the determination that a credit is warranted.
      (10)   A cable television system shall be designed for operation twenty-
four hours per day and shall endure service interruptions only for good cause
and for a reasonable time. Intentional interruptions of service shall be for
the shortest possible time.
      (11)   A written log shall be maintained by a grantee listing all service
calls, their disposition and all service interruptions affecting five or more
subscribers. Said log shall be available for inspection by the City upon
reasonable notice, subject to Section 631 of the Cable Act regarding subscriber

restored, unless restoration is prevented by cause beyond the control of the
grantee upon written notice to the grantee identifying the loss by channel,
date and time.
      (13)   A grantee shall not deny, delay or otherwise burden cable
television service or use of access facilities or otherwise discriminate

services or channel positions as soon as possible through announcements on the
cable system and in writing.  Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of
thirty days in advance of such changes if the changes are within the control of
the cable operator.
   (c)   A grantee shall file, upon request with the City Clerk, a notarized
statement signed by an officer or employee certifying compliance with the
customer service standards. A grantee in noncompliance shall file, on a
quarterly basis, a statement specifying areas of noncompliance along with a
remedial plan.

818.28 was repealed by implication by Ordinance 581, passed December 13, 1995.)
818.29  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of the
franchise is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and
independent provision, and such holding shall not render invalid and terminate
the franchise.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.30  RIGHT OF PRIVACY.
   A grantee shall not transmit any signal from any dwelling or any other
building, other than that necessary to operate the cable television system,
without the authorization of the owner of said dwelling or other building.
Where said owner has leased said dwelling or other building or a portion
thereof, said authorization shall be obtained from the lessee, and not from the
owner.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.31  RIGHTS OF RESIDENTS.
   (a)   An owner or operator of an apartment building, condominium, nursing
home or any other rental or other multiple-dwelling unit facility ("owner/
operator") may not interfere with, or charge a fee for, the installation of
cable facilities for the use of a lessee of said property or premises, except
that such owner or operator may require that:
      (1)   Installation of cable facilities conform to reasonable conditions
necessary to protect the safety, appearance and functioning of the premises;
      (2)   The grantee, occupant or tenant pay for the installation, operation
or removal of such facilities; or
      (3)   The grantee, occupant or tenant agree to indemnify the owner or
operator for any damages caused by the installation, operation or removal of
such facilities.
   (b)   A landlord may not discriminate in the amount of rent charged to
tenants or occupants who receive cable television services and to those who do
not. This shall not, however, preclude an owner/operator from incorporating the
receipt of cable television services as a factor in determining the rent or
other charges for a particular dwelling unit.
   (c)   A grantee may not take actions which would interfere with the
privilege of any tenant or other occupant of any such building to use master or
individual antenna equipment. This chapter shall not prohibit, however, the
ability of a grantee to enter into an exclusive contract with an owner/operator
for a fixed period of time.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.32  TAMPERING WITH CABLE EQUIPMENT.
   No person shall willfully or maliciously damage, or cause to be damaged, any
wire, cable, conduit, apparatus or equipment of the grantee, or commit any act
with intent to cause damage to any wire, cable, conduit, apparatus or equipment
of the grantee, or tap, tamper with, or connect or assist in connecting, any
wire or device to a wire, cable, conduit or equipment of the grantee in order
to either attempt to or actually obtain a signal or impulse therefrom without
authorization of the grantee. The existence of any unauthorized connection to
the grantee's cable system shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the
occupant of the dwelling unit connected by such unauthorized connection
actually intended to receive signals or impulses from the grantee's cable
television system. This section shall not prevent the grantee from removing,
disconnecting or otherwise rendering inoperable any of the grantee's apparatus
or equipment attached or in any way connected to such grantee's facilities, if
done for reasonable cause.
   The prohibitions, penalties and remedies set forth in this section and in
Section
818.99 are in addition to the penalties and remedies for theft of cable service
provided by Federal and State law.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.33  LIABILITY OF THE GRANTEE IN LIBEL ACTION.
   The grantee or its agents shall not, in an action for slander or for
publishing a libel, be held liable in damages for or on account of any
defamatory matter uttered, telecast, cablecast or published over the facilities
of the grantee by any person whose utterance, telecast, cablecast or
publication is not, under the provisions of any law of the United States or any
regulation, ruling or order of the Federal Communications Commission, subject
to censorship or control by the grantee.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.34  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT.
   The grantee shall not refuse to hire and shall not discharge from employment
or discriminate against any person regarding compensation, terms, conditions or
privileges of employment because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.
The grantee shall take affirmative action to ensure that employees are treated,
during employment, without regard to their sex, race, color, creed or national
origin.
(Ord. 581.  Passed 12-13-95.)
818.99  PENALTY.

therefor. No such license shall be granted except upon certification by the
Director of Inspections and the Fire Chief.
(1974 Code § 7.231)
   (b)   The fee for such license shall be as specified in the Business License
Fee Schedule.
(Ord. 797.  Passed 10-6-04.)
824.02  BUILDING REQUIREMENTS; FLOOR PLANS.
   (a)   Self-service or coin-operated dry cleaning locations shall be approved
by the Building Department prior to the installation of equipment. A floor plan
showing the building outline, any joint or adjacent occupancies and all
equipment shall accompany the license application.
   (b)   Approval of plans will not be granted for a building occupied in part
as a dwelling.
   (c)   A building should be a single story structure with a concrete floor in
good condition. Installations in buildings of other types may be approved upon
application, provided that adequate methods are used to protect health. The
requirements should take into consideration proper ventilation, confinement of
solvent within the dry cleaning service area and appropriate segregation of all
building areas and equipment. Solvent systems shall not be installed in any
basement or other location difficult to ventilate. Complete information about
the building and its construction shall be included in the plans.
   (d)   All establishments shall meet all other applicable requirements of

824.03  MACHINE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Installation plans for self-service or coin-operated dry cleaning
establishments shall be submitted to the Building Department at the time of
making an application for the license required by this chapter and shall
include information as to the number, make and model of the machines to be
installed, the type of cleaning fluid to be used and the weight of clothing per
load. All electrical equipment shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements of the National Electrical Code for hazardous locations and
special requirements of the local inspection authority.
   (b)   Coin-operated dry cleaning machines shall comply with the requirements
set forth in this section. Satisfactory performance shall be verified by field
tests. Manufacturers of dry cleaning machines shall provide the Building
Department with detailed installation, operation and maintenance manuals. A
complete description of the machine cycle, performance and location of all
controls shall be included.
   (c)   The machine design shall be such that essentially no solvent is
retained in the cleaned clothes upon completion of the dry cleaning cycle.
   (d)   a solvent vapor sensing device is desirable to control the drying
cycle and to prevent the removal of solvent-laden garments.
   (e)   There shall be a lock on the machine to prevent the loading door from
being opened during the complete cleaning cycle or in the event of a machine
malfunction or power failure. This system may be either electrical or
mechanical and so connected that the machine is fail-safe. The door lock shall
be actuated by suitable safety controls to prevent the removal of solvent-laden
clothing. Such controls shall sense malfunction of the solvent extraction,
drying and deodorizing system resulting from:
      (1)   Improper drum rotation speed;
      (2)   Insufficient heat input;
      (3)   Inadequate airflow or circulation; or
      (4)   Unsatisfactory solvent condensation or recovery.
   (f)   The cleaning equipment shall be provided with an exhaust system to
create a minimum of 100 feet per minute in-draft velocity through the loading
door whenever the door is open. The ductwork connections from this system shall
be sealed (soldered or taped) and the discharge stack extended to a minimum
height of five feet above the roof of the building housing the cleaning
equipment or above the roof line of any attached structure. Particular
attention shall be given to discharge stack height and location where dwellings
are located nearby.
   (g)   It is the responsibility of the proprietor to make certain that
clothing which cannot be properly cleaned and dried will not be placed in the
machines.
(1974 Code § 7.233)
824.04  INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Only the front or customer side of a dry cleaning machine may be
exposed in the customer area. The working or maintenance portion of the
equipment shall be separated from the customer area by a solid partition.
   (b)   There shall be a continuous flow of air from the customer area through
the partition as a means of minimizing any solvent build up in the customer
area and of controlling any minor solvent leakage.
   (c)   Minimum ventilation requirements are as follows:
      Minimum Flow Rate Per Machine
   Number of Machines   (CFM)
   1 - 3   500
   4 - 8   400
   9 - 16   375
   17 or more   360
   (d)   Ventilation rates per machine apply to drum loads of eight to ten
pounds. Where the machines are set up to handle cleaning loads of more than ten
pounds per drum, the ventilation requirements shall be proportionately
increased based on the weight of clothing handled. The exhaust ventilation
described in subsection (c) hereof shall be provided on a continuous basis
while the store is open for business. The fan wiring should be such that the
dry cleaning equipment cannot be operated unless the fan system is in
operation. Where interlocked wiring is used, some means should be provided for
operating the fan equipment which would otherwise be turned off because of dry
cleaning equipment breakdown.
(1974 Code § 7.234)
824.05  GRILLES.
   Air flow from the customer area into the service area may be through grilles
in the machine front or through grilles or openings in the partition. Grilles
or openings in the partition should be sized on the basis of 500 CFM per square
foot of net grille area and should be placed as close to the machines as
possible. As an example, the use of a thirty-inch by six-inch grille located
directly over each machine or drum is recommended.
(1974 Code § 7.235)
824.06  EMERGENCY VENTILATION FANS.
   An emergency ventilation fan shall be installed in the backroom or
maintenance area to be used in case of serious solvent leakage. This fan may be
installed in the rear wall. The combined capacity of the general ventilation
system required in Section
824.04 and the emergency fan shall be a minimum of 1,000 CFM per machine. The
emergency fan switch should be installed near the service area access door.
(1974 Code § 7.236)
824.07  DUCTS; BACK-DRAFT DAMPERS.
   Where deodorizing vents are connected to a common duct, the main duct shall
be sized to maintain rated airflow from all the units and shall extend to a
minimum height of five feet above the roof line. Back-draft dampers in
individual deodorizing stacks may be required.
(1974 Code § 7.237)
824.08  DIKING.
   A satisfactory means of preventing solvent leakage from the enclosure shall
be provided. This shall include some method of diking completely around the dry
cleaning machine base and service area. A masonry dike or a recessed floor area
is recommended. The frontal projection of the dike shall be sufficient to catch
any solvent which leaks from the loading door of the machine. The dike shall
have a minimum height of two inches. The floor area within the dike shall be
sloped to a gravity drain which connects to a properly sized solvent holding
tank.
(1974 Code § 7.238)
824.09  MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OR MACHINES; GRAVITY DRAIN TANKS.
   Where multiples of individual dry cleaning machines or systems, not
interconnected, are used, the gravity drain tank should be sized to hold a
minimum of twenty-five percent of the total solvent capacity of all of the
machines, but not less than the capacity of one individual machine or system.
For purposes of calculation, a machine or system includes all interconnected
equipment within the system.
(1974 Code § 7.239)
824.10  MAKEUP AIR SUPPLIES.
   A supply of tempered makeup air equal to or greater than the total volume of
air being continually exhausted from the dry cleaning plant should be provided
in order to eliminate negative pressure conditions which might develop. A
tempered makeup air supply is required for all installations of more than four
machines, for all installations in buildings with dry cleaning machines only
and for all installations where field tests indicate that down-drafting of
combustion flues results from operation of the exhaust fan equipment. The
tempering capacity of makeup air equipment shall be sufficient to provide a
minimum of a sixty degree Fahrenheit temperature rise for the quantity of air
being supplied. Where tempered makeup air equipment is not provided, a
permanent open louvered area shall be provided to allow air to enter the
building. This area shall be sized on the basis of one square foot of net
opening per 500 CFM.
(1974 Code § 7.240)
824.11  GENERAL OPERATING REQUIREMENTS; INSTRUCTION LISTS; FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.
   (a)   Dry cleaning machines shall be checked daily and kept in good repair.

to administrative revocation upon completion of the investigation.  If a
canvasser requests an identification card, the investigation will proceed as

revokes, the identification card to one or more persons, he or she shall
immediately convey the decision to the applicant orally and shall within two
business days after the denial, prepare a written report of the reason for the
denial, which shall be immediately made available to the applicant. Upon
receipt of the oral notification, and even before the preparation of the
written report, the applicant shall have at his or her option an appeal
relative to the denial of his or her application before the City Council, at
its next regular meeting, or if the next regular meeting is more than ten days
from the denial of the application, at a special meeting to be held within that

enforcement of a judgment under Chapters 40 or 60 of the Revised Judicature

of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more then five hundred dollars

      (1)   If a defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, costs, or
other damages or expenses, or installment as ordered by the district court,
upon motion of the City or upon its own motion, the court may require the
defendant to show cause why the defendant should not be held in civil contempt
and may issue a summons, order to show cause, or bench warrant of arrest for
the defendant's appearance.
      (2)   If a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil fine,
costs, or damages or expenses, the individuals authorized to make disbursements
shall pay the fine, costs, or damages or expenses, and their failure to do so
shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this
subsection.
      (3)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to
an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or
her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment,
the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may
order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the amount due
is paid.
      (4)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine, costs, or
damages or expenses does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter an
order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount
of payment or each installment or revoking the fine, costs, or damages or
expenses.

   (b)   "Taximeter" means a mechanical instrument or device by which the

(1974 Code § 7.101)
866.02  TAXICAB LICENSES REQUIRED; APPLICATIONS; INSPECTIONS; FEES; ISSUANCE.
   (a)   No person shall operate, upon the streets of the City, any taxicab for
hire without first obtaining a license therefor. No such license shall be
issued except on the approval of Council. The City Clerk, with the approval of
Council, is hereby authorized to grant a license for the operation of taxicabs
within the City to any citizen of the United States who is twenty-one years of
age or older, who is of good moral character, and to any firm or corporation
duly organized for the purpose of operating a taxicab business, which firm or
corporation has fully complied with all laws of the State pertaining thereto.
The person applying for such license shall produce proof, to the satisfaction
of Council, that there is a public necessity for the issuance of a license to
the applicant.
(1974 Code § 7.103)
   (b)   An application for a license for a taxicab for hire shall be made by
the owner upon blanks to be furnished by the City Clerk. Such application shall
contain the full name and address of the owner, the class of vehicle for which
a license is desired, the length of time the vehicle has been in use, the
number of persons it is capable of carrying and the motor number thereof. An
auto mechanic certified by the State of Michigan shall examine and inspect each
taxicab to see that it is thoroughly safe for transportation of passengers. A
copy of such certification shall be provided to the City. If, after inspection,
the taxicab is deemed satisfactory, and the applicant has met the other
requirements in this chapter, then a license shall be issued upon payment of a
license fee as specified in the Business License Fee Schedule. Upon such
issuance there shall be delivered to the owner, in addition to the license, a
card of such size and form as may be prescribed by the City Clerk. Such card
shall contain the date of inspection of the same, a statement to the effect
that in case of complaint, the Police Department shall be notified, and the
license number of the taxicab. Such card shall be signed by the City Clerk and
shall contain blank spaces upon which entry may be made of the date of every
inspection of the vehicle. The City Clerk shall issue with each license a
license plate or tag for each motor vehicle license, which license plate or tag
shall be displayed in a conspicuous place upon the taxicab or motor vehicle for
hire.
(Ord. 709.  Passed 12-20-00; Ord. 797.  Passed 10-6-04.)
866.03  INSURANCE; BOND.
   (a)   Before the issuance of a license to operate a taxicab or motor vehicle
for hire, a licensee shall file a certificate signed by a duly authorized
officer of a company authorized to write insurance in the State to the effect
that a policy of insurance has been issued to the licensee and is in full force
and effect, and that the premium has been paid as required thereon, together
with a true copy of the policy contract or certificate of insurance. In cases
where the insurance premium is payable monthly, proper certificates or
evidences of payment of the premiums shall be delivered to the City Clerk not
later than the first day of each month. Such policy of insurance shall be in
the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), conditioned for the payment
of any judgments recovered against a person for death or injury to persons or
damage to property caused in the operation, maintenance, use or defective
construction of such motor vehicle. Such policy of insurance may limit the
liability of the insurer on any judgment to one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) for bodily injuries or death of one person and two hundred thousand
dollars ($200,000) for bodily injuries or death of more than one person, and
one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for damage to or destruction of
property. On all judgments recovered upon claims arising out of the same
transaction, or transactions connected with the same subject of action, the
maximum liability for public liability shall be two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000), and for property damage one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
Such policy of insurance shall contain a provision for a continuing liability
thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery thereon,
and a provision that until the policy is revoked as provided in this chapter,
the insurance company will not be relieved from liability on account of
nonpayment of premium, failure to renew a license at the end of the year or any
act or omission of the named insured. Any insurance company whose policy has
been so filed pursuant to this section may file a notice with the Police
Department of its intention to terminate and cancel such policy and give notice
thereof to the named licensee. Whereupon, ten days after such filing, such
licensee or owner shall cease to operate or cause to be operated in the City
such taxicab or motor vehicle for hire. The license issued therefor shall be
automatically revoked and liability on such policy shall cease and terminate,
provided that the liability of the insurance company thereon for any act or
omission of the licensee or owner occurring prior to the effective date of
cancellation shall not be thereby discharged or impaired.
   (b)   In lieu of the policy of insurance provided for in subsection (a)
hereof, the licensee may furnish a good and sufficient surety bond, in a form
approved by the City Attorney, in the penal sum of two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000) for each taxicab, with two or more good and sufficient personal
sureties, or with a surety company satisfactory to the Police Department,
holding and binding the principal and sureties to the same conditions as are
required in policies of insurance provided for in subsection (a) hereof. In the
case of personal sureties, each such surety shall own property in the City, in
the surety's own name, of a value of at least double the amount as such bond,
and shall execute an affidavit of justification.
866.04  RATES.
   (a)   No person owning, operating or controlling any motor vehicle operated
as a taxicab or motor vehicle for hire in the City shall charge an amount in
excess of an amount set by the City for the following respective areas:
From any point north of Northline Road to any point south of Eureka Road;
From any point west of Reeck Road to any point east of Trenton Road; and
All other points in the City.
   (b)   The rate established shall be per person carried and there shall be no
limit as to the number of persons such taxicab shall carry, except as the same
affects or intrudes upon the safe operation of the motor vehicle. There shall
be posted in a conspicuous place on the inside of each taxicab a card on which
shall be printed in plain legible type the rates of fare as provided for in
this chapter. Council may, from time to time, by resolution, change such rates
as it deems necessary to serve the best interest of both the taxicab owner and
the public. Council may, in its discretion in changing the rates, conduct a
public hearing thereon.

investigation, but no temporary license shall be valid for more than twenty
days. No license shall be issued to any person under this chapter who has been

drivers' licenses, not inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and
reasonable.

be so attached to the license that it cannot be removed and another photograph
substituted without detection.
(1974 Code § 7.107)
866.07  FORM AND TERM OF DRIVER'S LICENSE; DISPLAY.
   Upon satisfactory fulfillment of the requirements set forth in Sections

the discretion of Council. A driver's license shall be issued as of January 1

business office in the City where telephone service will be maintained twenty-
four hours a day and where taxicabs will be at the disposal of the public, upon
request, twenty-four hours a day. Failure to operate such taxicabs or telephone
service on a twenty-four hour basis shall be sufficient reason for the
cancellation of any license issued to an owner of the taxicab. A business
office shall be construed to mean an office in a building designated for
commercial use. Such office shall not be located in a temporary building or in
a building that is in existence under the basis of a temporary permit. However,
Council, when it is satisfied that a business office, not necessarily in the
City, shall be operated, and where telephone service will be maintained twenty-
four hours a day, may waive the requirement of a business office located in the
City.

records of the receipt of such property.
(1974 Code § 7.114)

in the City unless previously engaged or unable to do so. No driver of a

   The Board of Review may entertain a petition of a taxpayer for temporary
relief from the payment of real estate taxes where such petition is based upon
a demonstrated and proven inability to pay. In the case of exemptions made to
persons who, in the opinion of the City Assessor and the Board, by reason of
poverty, are unable to contribute towards the public charges, the City Assessor
or the Board shall require, as a condition to the grant of a temporary
exemption, a lien and agreement for reimbursement upon a form reading
substantially as follows:
   KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, That the undersigned
_______________________, residing at ____________________________, being the
owner of the real estate hereinafter described, does hereby request that
because of my present inability to pay, I be relieved from the payment of any
City, School and County property taxes for the fiscal year commencing January
1, 19__ for City taxes and December 1, 19__, for School and County taxes, and
if this request is granted, I hereby promise and agree as follows:
   1.   In the event of the subsequent disposition of this property by sale,
gift, devise or other means, all of the property taxes from which I am being
relieved by this agreement shall be paid to the City, School and County,
respectively, at the time of such transfer.
   2.   I hereby charge and encumber such real estate and any improvements
existing thereon or hereafter erected with full payment and satisfaction of
such taxes and such charges shall be a valid lien and obligation, enforceable
against such real estate and against my heirs, assigns, devisees, vendees,
personal representatives or successors in title.
   3.   I hereby authorize the City Assessor to record this agreement with the
County Register of Deeds as a valid and binding lien on the real estate herein
described.
   4.   I hereby promise that this agreement and the lien created hereby will
not be contested in any way by myself, my heirs, assigns, personal
representatives or successors in title.

reimbursement and knows the contents thereof and that he/she has signed said
document as his/her free act and deed.
PREPARED BY:         _______________________________________         
                           Notary Public, Wayne County
                           My commission expires: ________________
   Such instrument shall assign to the City such amount of taxes as are
temporarily relieved by the action of the Board. No such lien and agreement for
reimbursement shall deprive the owner of the property to whom the temporary tax
exemption is granted of his or her right to freely occupy and use the property,
but shall give the City, in the event of the ownership of such property being
transferred to another in any manner whatsoever, such an interest therein as
will provide for the payment to the City of an amount equal to all taxes which
would have been assessed and collected by the City against the property of such
owner had the temporary exemption not been granted, with interest, in addition
thereto, in such amount as is provided by law for the collection of delinquent
taxes.

886.01  PURPOSE; ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE CHARGE.
   It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the State and its
political subdivisions to provide housing for its senior citizens and to
encourage the development of such housing by providing for a service charge in
lieu of property taxes in accordance with the State Housing Development
Authority Act of 1966 (1966 PA 346, as amended, M.C.L.A. 125.1401 et seq.;
M.S.A. 116.114(1) et seq.).  The City is authorized by this Act to establish or
change the service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all classes of
housing exempt from taxation under this Act at any amount it chooses, not to
exceed the taxes that would be paid but for this Act.  It is further
acknowledged that such housing for senior citizens is a public necessity, and,
as the City will be benefited and improved by such housing, the encouragement
of the same by providing certain real estate tax exemption for such housing is
a valid public purpose.  Further, the continuance of the provisions of this
chapter for tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of taxes during the
period contemplated in this chapter are essential to the determination of the
economic feasibility of housing developments which are constructed and financed
in reliance on this chapter and such service charge.

development of each abutting lot or parcel of land. The City Engineer shall
give written notice of the intention to install such sewer and water
connections and to charge the cost of the same to the premises, to each owner
of land abutting the street to be furnished with such connections, as shown by

that all service connections used by such person shall be connected only with
the nearest main source of supply laid in the alley or street nearest to the
building into which it is desired to conduct such service.
   (g)   Excavations; Restoration. At least forty-eight hours before opening or
excavating in any street, alley or public place for the above purposes or for
any other purpose, except in cases of emergency, and except for service
connection installations, such person shall notify the City Engineer's office,
in writing, of the intent to excavate, stating the number of the permit and the
date of issuance thereof. In the opening and refilling of such openings and
excavations, the relaying of the pavement and other work necessary to the
complete restoration of the street, pavement, sidewalk or grounds to an equally
good condition as when disturbed, shall be under the supervision of the City
Engineer. No street, alley or public place shall be allowed to remain open or
encumbered for a longer period than authorized to execute the work for which
the same has been opened, and the City Engineer may extend the period allowed
for the completion of such work for such time as the City Engineer deems
necessary.
   The earth removed in making such excavation shall be restored. However,
where pavement has been broken, no debris, broken concrete or noncompatible
substance shall be used in refilling. The pavement shall be relaid by such
person in as good a condition as before the making of such excavation, and
thereafter shall be maintained in as good a condition as the surrounding
pavement until the street, alley or public place is allowed to remain open or
for so long as such street, alley or public place is encumbered, when
authorized by the City Engineer.
   The cost of restoring the earth or other costs arising from such
excavations, the relaying of the pavement and the repairs thereto caused by the
opening of such street, alley or public place shall be at the expense of such
person. Such work shall be done under the supervision of the City Engineer, and
the expense of such supervision shall be paid by such person upon presentation
of bills certified by the Director of Inspections. Any expense incurred by the
City because of the neglect of such person or his or her employees in the doing
of any work, or the doing of the same in an unworkmanlike manner, or for the
digging of ditches or holes, the erection of poles, the restoration of earth or
any excavation, or relaying or replacing any pavement, shall be paid in a like
manner by such person upon presentation of a bill certified by the Director.
Such person, in each instance, shall promptly pay all bills for labor,

service the building, if less than thirty feet from the building, shall be run
underground.

poles, wires, conduits, mains, pipes or other appliances shall thereupon be
removed or relocated, upon proper permit to do so, at the expense of the person
erecting, laying or controlling the same.
   (k)   Orders to Remove or Alter. When wires erected or conduits, mains or
other appliances laid or constructed under this section, or which may have been

455, passed November 9, 1988), interfere in any way with the use, improvement
or alteration of any street, alley, lane, park or other public place by the
City, Council may direct the removal of the same or such alteration in relation
thereto as will obviate or prevent such interference. Failure to so remove or
alter the same shall be considered a violation of this section.
   (l)   Emergencies. In cases of emergency, such as, but not limited to,
repairs to gas mains, repairs to service and service connections or any
breakdown of the utility company service, no permit will be required to place
the service in operation. Copies of the utility company work orders or repairs
shall be submitted to the Building Department as soon as possible after repairs
are made. Permit and inspection fees will be billed to the utility company by
the City Engineer and are payable on receipt.

1028.01  FINDINGS.
   The City finds that rapid growth, the spread of development and increasing
demands upon natural resources have had the effect of encroaching upon,
despoiling, or eliminating many of the trees, woodlands and other forms of
vegetation and natural resources and processes associated therewith which, if
preserved and maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition, constitute
important physical, aesthetic, recreational, health and economic assets to
existing and future residents of the City. Specifically, the City finds:
   (a)   That trees and woodlands protect the public health through the
absorption of air pollutants and contamination, by the reduction of excessive
noise and mental and physical damage related to noise pollution, and through
their cooling effect in the summer months;
   (b)   That trees and woodlands are an essential component of the general
welfare of the City by maintaining natural beauty, recreational opportunities,
wildlife habitat, and irreplaceable heritage for existing and future City
residents;
   (c)   That trees and woodlands play an important role in filtering waste
water which passes through the ground from the surface to ground water tables
and lower aquifers;
   (d)   That trees and woodlands, through their root systems, stabilize the
soil and play an important and effective part in City-wide soil conservation,
erosion control, and flood control;
   (e)   That trees and woodlands appreciably reduce the carbon dioxide content
and increase the oxygen content of the air and play a vital role in purifying
the air; and,
   (f)   That the protection of such natural resources is a matter of paramount
public concern, as provided by Article IV, Section 52, of the Constitution of
the State of Michigan and the Michigan Environmental Protection Act of 1970,
being M.C.L.A. 691.1201 et seq.
(Ord. 682.  Passed 8-18-99; Ord. 829.  Passed 6-14-06.)
1028.02  PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are:
   (a)   To provide for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance and
use of trees and woodlands located in the City in order to minimize disturbance
to them and to prevent damage from erosion and siltation, a loss of wildlife
and vegetation, and/or from the destruction of the natural habitat;
   (b)   To protect the trees, woodlands, and other forms of vegetation of the
City for their economic support of local property values when allowed to remain
uncleared and/or unharvested and for their natural beauty, wilderness character
and ecological or historical significance;
   (c)   To provide for the paramount public concern for these natural
resources in the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the City.
(Ord. 682. Passed 8-18-99; Ord. 829.  Passed 6-14-06.)

adjoining street right-of-way and trees twenty-five feet beyond the limits of
the property lines, including adjacent properties and all trees to be affected
by the development, such as trees located within areas of right-of-way
improvements or off-site utility work. All such trees proposed to remain, to be
relocated or to be removed, shall be so designated and the numbered trees shall
be identified by size (DBH), grade at the base of each tree and crown spread to
scale. Such verified information shall be provided by a registered land
surveyor. The survey shall be accompanied by a separate key identifying the
numbered trees by size, common name/genus and condition. This information must
be provided by a registered landscape architect, certified arborist or
forester, through an on-site inspection, who must verify the contents by seal
or signature, whichever applies.

1028.09  REVIEW OF TREE PERMIT APPLICATION. 
   The City shall process a tree permit application as follows:
   (a)   The Department shall review the tree permit application to verify that
all required information has been provided. At the request of the applicant or
the Department, an administrative meeting may be held to review the proposed
application in light of the purpose and review standards of this section.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a complete application, the Department may conduct or
authorize the completion of a field investigation to review and verify the
accuracy of information received and during such review shall refer to the
woodlands area map, if applicable. The receipt of a tree permit application
shall constitute permission from the owner of the property to conduct such on-
site investigation.
   (c)   If a tree permit application relates to a proposed development or
activity on a site necessitating site plan review or plat approval or any other
type of permit approval by the City Planning Commission, the Commission shall
consider said application concurrent with its review of the related site plan
or plat or other permit approval. If the Commission approves a site plan or
plat or other permit which conforms with the requirements of this section, that
approval, together with any additional terms and conditions attached thereto,
will be considered to have fulfilled the requirements for a tree removal
permit.
   (d)   When a tree permit application is not related to a development or
activity necessitating review and approval of a site plan or plat or other
permit by the Planning Commission, the Director shall be responsible for
granting or denying the application. In the event the tree permit application
is related to development on property for which administrative site plan
approval is required prior to his or her decision, notice of the tree permit
application shall be sent by first-class mail to all property owners adjoining
the property upon which the development is proposed (including property
directly across of rights-of-way and easements) at least fifteen days before
the Director makes his or her decision, which notice shall indicate where and
when the tree permit application may be examined and which shall further
indicate that said owner(s) may file a written objection thereto with the
Department.
   (e)   The City shall not issue a tree permit related to an administrative
site plan approval approved by the Director until ten days have passed
following such approval. Any person denied a tree permit by the Director or any
owner of property adjoining the property upon which a development is proposed
(including property directly across public rights-of-way and easements) when a
tree permit related to an administrative site plan approval is approved, may
appeal to the Planning Commission. An appeal must be filed in the City Clerk's
office, in writing, within ten days of the date of mailing of the decision
being appealed. Timely filing of an appeal shall have the effect of suspending
the issuance of a tree permit related to an administrative site plan approval
pending the outcome of the appeal. The Planning Commission, upon review, shall
determine, with findings, whether or not there has been compliance with the
requirements and standards of this section and, based upon its findings, it may
affirm, reverse or modify the decision rendered by the Director. The applicant
would then have the right to appeal the Planning Commission decision to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (f)   Whenever an application for a tree permit is granted, the Planning
Commission shall:
      (1)   Attach to the granting of the tree permit any reasonable conditions
considered necessary to ensure that the intent of this section will be
fulfilled;
      (2)   Affix a reasonable time to carry out the activities approved in the
permit; and
      (3)   Require the permit grantee to file with the City a cash or
corporate surety bond or irrevocable bank letter of credit in an amount
determined necessary to ensure compliance with tree permit conditions and this
section.

(Ord. 682. Passed 8-18-99; Ord. 829.  Passed 6-14-06.)
1028.16  FEE FOR ILLEGALLY REMOVED TREES.
   (a)   In addition to any penalty provided for in the event of a conviction
for a violation of this chapter, and notwithstanding whether or not the City
has commenced a civil suit for injunctive relief, any person who removes or
causes any tree to be removed except in accordance with this chapter shall
forfeit and pay to the City a civil fee equal to the total value of trees
illegally removed or damaged, as computed from the International Society of
Arboriculture shade tree value formula. The fee shall accrue to the City and,
if necessary, the City may file a civil action to recover the fee. The City
shall place any sum collected in the City Tree Fund. Alternatively, the City
may require replacement of illegally removed or damaged trees as restitution in
lieu of the fee. Reimbursement for expenses shall be made to the City's Tree
Fund if the Department performs any work associated with removing, trimming, or
replacing damaged trees. Replacement will be on an inch-to-inch basis computed
by adding the total diameter measured at DBH in inches of the illegally removed
or damaged trees. The City may use other reasonable means to estimate the tree
loss if destruction of the illegally removed or damaged trees prevents exact
measurement. The City may also require a combination of fee payment and tree
replacement.
   (b)   Additionally, in the event of an illegally removed tree from a public
right-of-way, an additional fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be
assessed to reimburse the City for its costs in the administration and
enforcement of this section, and for labor costs associated with remediation;
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for a second offense by a person or
entity within one year of a first offense; and one thousand dollars ($1,000)

notice upon such owner or occupant, directing him or her to cause such work to
be done. Upon his or her failure to comply with the notice, the City may enter
upon the premises and perform the work and the cost shall be served and charged
pursuant to Sections
194 and
157, respectively, of the City Charter. Such sections of the Charter shall be
construed as supplementary to this chapter and shall constitute a part of this
chapter with the same effect as if those sections were fully written and
contained in this chapter.
(Ord. 682. Passed 8-18-99; Ord. 829.  Passed 6-14-06.)

competent jurisdiction for an order abating or enjoining the violation.
(Ord. 682. Passed 8-18-99; Ord. 829.  Passed 6-14-06.)
1028.19  STOP-WORK ORDER.
   The City may also issue a stop-work order or withhold issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, permits or inspections until the provisions of this
chapter, including any conditions attached to a tree permit, have been fully
met. Failure to obey a stop-work order shall constitute a violation of this
section.
(Ord. 682. Passed 8-18-99; Ord. 829.  Passed 6-14-06.)

conditions that it deems necessary or desirable for the public interest and in
furtherance of the intent of this chapter.
   (b)   No variance shall be granted unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds:
      (1)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right by the applicant; or
      (3)   That the variance will further the objectives and policies of this
chapter of the City Code.

twenty feet each way from the intersection of the right-of-way lines on any
corner lot in the City, shall not be permitted to grow to a height of more than
thirty inches from the top of the curb at street level, in order that the view
of the driver of a vehicle approaching a street intersection is not obstructed.

   (a)   Any Ash tree or state-designated tree with the City, which is infected
with Emerald Ash Borer Disease, is hereby declared a public nuisance.
   (b)   The City shall, pursuant to Section
194 of the Charter, which provides that it shall have the power to prohibit the
maintenance of diseased trees and shrubbery on private premises, shall have the
right to enter premises for the purpose of inspecting and determining whether
any Ash tree located on private property is or may be infected, with the
Emerald Ash Borer Disease, and if any tree is found to be so infected, to place
a distinguishing mark thereon.
   (c)   Every person owning any Ash tree located within the City limits, and
on a portion of private property, which is not a public easement for the right-
of-way, shall remove such tree at his or her expense, within twenty days after
notice by the Department of Public Services, that such tree has been infected
with Emerald Ash Borer Disease. The City, may, at its option, either through
use of its own equipment and personnel, or through arrangements with a private
contractor, offer tree removal services with respect to such infected Ash
trees; if such service is available. Any owner shall be deemed to have complied
with the requirements of these sections if, after twenty days after the notice,
the owner has authorized the City in writing, to remove such infected Ash tree
at the owners cost, expense and responsibility.
   (d)   In the event the Department of Public Services determines, with the
concurrence of the Mayor, that immediate action is required to abate such
public nuisance, the City may, with three days notice, and without allowing the
twenty days to take such action, remove such infected Ash tree. The cost of
such emergency abatement may be charged against the owner or against the
premises.
   (e)   No person shall store, sell, deliver or bring into the City, wood from
any Ash tree to be used as firewood or for any other purpose. Homeowners,
contractors, and/or the City will use regional drop sites designated by the
State of Michigan for the disposal of the trees.
   (f)   The City may, subject to the approval of the City Council, promulgate
additional rules and regulations pertaining to the removal, care, maintenance
or protection of trees which are, or may become infected with the disease as
may be necessary to protect the property, health or safety of the public.
   (g)   Removal of trees pursuant to this section shall be exempt from the
tree permit requirements of Section
1028.06 and the tree replacement requirements of Section
1028.13 of the City Code.

1041.04  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS FOR WASTEWATER TRANSMISSION
FACILITIES.
   All wastewater transmission facilities connecting directly or indirectly to
County wastewater facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the following minimum requirements. The County Agency may deny a
connection permit for a transmission facility which is not in substantial
compliance with these design and construction standards and conditions, or for
which a satisfactory schedule cannot be agreed upon to bring it into
compliance.
   (a)   General Regulations.
      (1)   All public sewer systems connecting directly or  indirectly to a
County sewer shall be approved by each municipality to be served by the
proposed facility and by the County Agency having jurisdiction. County approval
shall not be given until each municipality in which the proposed facility is to
be physically located has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the plans and specifications for the facility.
      (2)   If a sewer project is not under construction or a contract awarded
within two years of approval by the County Agency, the approval shall be void,
unless an extension of time has been approved by the County Agency.
      (3)   Construction shall not commence until all applicable local, State
and Federal permits have been obtained.
      (4)   No new public sewer systems shall be placed in service until test
results have been reviewed by the County Agency. Within two working days of
receipt of those results, the County Agency will accept or reject the system.
If the County Agency has not acted within that time, the project may be placed
in service. The County Agency's approval is also subject to the receipt of
acceptable as-built plans within ninety days of acceptance of the system.
      (5)   Any sewer which services two or more separate buildings or
dwellings shall be a public sewer, unless the buildings are part of a singly-
owned industrial complex or a public complex where future division of ownership
is not anticipated.
      (6)   New construction shall be limited to separate wastewater
transmission facilities, which outlet into a separate system. (See subsection
(b) hereof.)
      (7)   Pumping systems will not be approved where, in the opinion of the
County Agency, it is feasible to construct gravity sewer systems.
      (8)   For items not specifically covered herein, the design, in general,
shall conform to the "Recommended Standards for Sewage Works" of the Great
Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers, more commonly
referred to as the "10-State Standards".
   (b)   Design Flows.
      (1)   Wastewater transmission systems shall be designed on the basis of
an average flow of 100 gallons per capita per day, unless another flow is
specifically approved by the County Agency.
      (2)   Sewers shall be designed to carry, when running full, the flows
specifically approved by the County Agency.
      (3)   Calculations showing the basis of design shall be submitted to the
County Agency, except for service areas which are to be served by eight-inch
sewers.
   (c)   Sewers.
      (1)   General regulations.
         A.   Any generally accepted material for sewers will be given
consideration, but the material selected should be adapted to local conditions,
such as character of industrial wastes, possibility of septicity, soil
characteristics, exceptionally heavy external loadings, bedding, abrasion and
similar problems.
         B.   Sewer joints and materials shall be designed to minimize
infiltration and to prevent the entrance of roots.
         C.   All sewer systems shall be designed so as to limit infiltration
to 200 gallons per inch of pipe diameter per mile of sewer per day. All points
of future connection to the system shall be sealed to meet leakage restrictions
and testing requirements.
         D.   Sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to prevent freezing. The
minimum depth to the top of pipe shall be forty-two inches.
         E.   Sewers shall be properly vented.
         F.   A bulkhead shall be installed at each outlet to an existing
system, and shall not be removed until the new sewer system has been accepted
by the County Agency.
         G.   Sewers shall be laid at least ten feet, horizontally, from any
existing or proposed water main. A minimum vertical clearance of eighteen
inches shall be maintained between the top of the sewer and the bottom of the
water main under which it crosses. Vertical clearance of less than eighteen
inches or crossing of a sewer over a water main will require that special
measures be taken to prevent contamination of the water supply, such as
encasement of the sewer.
         H.   No connections from footing drains, sump pumps, roofleaders,
etc., shall be made to the system.
         I.   Tree plantings, for restoration purposes, shall not be permitted
within fifteen feet of the center line of new or repaired sewers.
      (2)   Public sewers.
         A.   Sewers shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter.
         B.   Sewers shall be designed for mean velocities, when flowing full,
at design flows of not less than 2.0 feet per second, based on Kutter's formula
using an "n" value of 0.013. Use of other "n" values may be permitted if deemed
justifiable on the basis of research or field data presented.
         C.   Sewers shall be designed with a uniform line and grade between
manholes.
         D.   When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the invert of the larger
sewer shall be lowered at least enough to maintain the 0.8 depth point of both
sewers at the same elevation.
         E.   Where velocities greater than fifteen feet per second may be
attained, special provision shall be made to protect against scouring and
thrust displacement.
      (3)   Building sewers.
         A.   A separate building sewer shall be provided for each building or
dwelling.
         B.   The building drain connection to the building sewer shall be
sealed by an approved method and encased in concrete to provide a water tight
seal.
         C.   Building sewers shall be designed and installed so as to limit
infiltration to 200 gallons per inch of sewer diameter per mile of sewer per
twenty-four hours, and local public authorities shall conduct testing programs
which will assure substantial conformance to this infiltration requirement.
         D.   Building drain inlets shall be sealed by an approved method
during construction and seals shall not be removed until plumbing is carried to
the first floor, basement walls are backfilled, the footing drain system is
operating, and such other precautions have been taken as are necessary to
insure that no storm or ground water will enter the sanitary sewer.
         E.   No wyes, cleanouts or similar appurtenances shall be connected to
a building sewer or a building drain outside the walls of the building except
where specifically required by local building codes. Where so required, such
appurtenances shall be sealed by an approved method so as to insure that no
storm or ground water will accidentally or intentionally be admitted through
the appurtenances.
         F.   No trap shall be installed in the building drain between the main
vent and the building sewer.
         G.   The minimum grade of building sewers shall be one foot per 100
feet (1.00%).
         H.   Building sewers shall not be connected to manholes except from
the upstream side of a terminal manhole.
   (d)   Manholes.
      (1)   Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all changes
in grade, size, or alignment; and at all intersections. Spacing between
manholes shall not exceed 400 feet on runs of sewer forty-eight inches in a
diameter or less. On runs of sewer greater than forty-eight inches in diameter,
spacing of manholes shall be approximately 100 times the diameter of the sewer.
      (2)   Manholes constructed in road rights-of-way shall be located away
from open ditch drainage systems so that no portion of any manhole protrudes
into the drainage ditch. If necessary, the open ditch system shall be relocated
or enclosed adjacent to the manhole to provide complete cover around the
manhole.
      (3)   Manhole construction shall be precast concrete with modified
grooved tongue joints and gasket, unless otherwise approved by the County
Agency.
      (4)   Manhole steps shall be constructed of cast iron, unless otherwise
approved by the County Agency.
      (5)   A standard drop connection shall be provided for a sewer whose
invert is at an elevation of eighteen inches or more above the spring line of
the existing sewer. Where the difference in elevation between the invert of the
incoming sewer and the manhole invert is less than eighteen inches, the manhole
should be filleted to prevent solids deposition.
      (6)   The minimum inside diameter of manholes shall be forty-eight
inches, and drop connections or other permanent devices (except manhole steps)
which would reduce any clear inside dimension to less than forty-eight inches
shall not be installed in a manhole.
      (7)   There shall not be less than ten inches of undisturbed concrete
between adjacent openings in the manhole nor shall more than fifty percent of
the circumference along any horizontal plane be removed without special
reinforcing or strengthening of the walls as approved by the County Agency.

   (h)   Testing. The County Agency shall be notified one working day in
advance of all post-construction testing. The following tests shall be
performed by qualified personnel approved by the County Agency and a written
report furnished to and approved by the County Agency prior to placing any
public facility in service:
      (1)   Sewer systems.
         A.   Visible and audible checks shall be made of the sewers and
manholes and all leaks repaired prior to testing.
         B.   All sewer lines, which are not inspected by walking or crawling
through the sewer, shall be televised for misalignment, infiltration, for
defective pipe or joints and for debris. For a point of clarity, pipe size
thirty inches in diameter and smaller shall be televised.
         C.   Leakage tests shall be conducted on all new sewer lines and
existing lines which have not been previously approved.
         D.   All sewers shall be subjected to air, infiltration or
exfiltration tests, or a combination of the same, prior to acceptance by the
County Agency. All sewers over twenty-four inches in diameter shall be
subjected to infiltration tests before initial start-up. All sewers twenty-four
inches in diameter or smaller, where the ground water level above the top of
the sewer is over seven feet, shall be subjected to infiltration tests. All
sewers twenty-four inches in diameter or less, where the ground water level
above the top of the sewer is seven feet or less, shall be subject to air tests
or exfiltration tests. If an exfiltration test is performed, the maximum
exfiltration rate shall be the same as that permitted from infiltration. For
the purpose of exfiltration testing, the internal water level shall be equal to
the external water level plus seven feet as measured from the top of pipe, and
the elevation must be at least as high as the highest house service.
         E.   Maximum allowable infiltration shall not exceed 200 gallons per
inch of diameter per mile of pipe between manholes per twenty-four hours for
any section of the system and shall include the infiltration from all manholes
and other appurtenances.
         F.   The procedure for air testing of sewers shall be as follows:
            All house leads shall be properly plugged and blocked to withstand
the air pressure. The sewer line shall be tested in increments between
manholes. The line shall be cleaned and plugged at each manhole. Such plugs
shall be designed to hold against the test pressure and shall provide an
airtight seal. One of the plugs shall have an orifice through which air can be
introduced into the sewer. An air supply line shall be connected to the
orifice. The air supply line shall be fitted with suitable control valves and a
pressure gauge for continually measuring the air pressure in the sewer. The
pressure gauge shall have a minimum diameter of three and one-half inches and
range of 0-10 PSIG. The gauge shall have minimum divisions of 0.10 PSIG and an
accuracy of +/- 0.04 PSIG.
            The sewer shall be pressurized to 4.0 PSIG greater than the
greatest back pressure caused by groundwater over the top of the sewer pipe. At
least two minutes shall be allowed for the air pressure to stabilize between
3.5 and 4.0 PSIG. If necessary, air shall be added to the sewer to maintain a
pressure of 3.5 PSIG or greater.
            After the stabilization period, the air supply control valve shall
be closed so that no more air will enter the sewer. The sewer air pressure
shall be noted and timing for the test begun. The test shall not begin if the
air pressure is less than 3.5 PSIG, or such other pressure as is necessary to
compensate for ground water level.
            The time required for the air pressure to decrease 1.0 PSIG during
the test shall be in accordance with the standards of the County Agency.
            Manholes on sewers to be subject to air tests shall be equipped
with a half-inch diameter galvanized capped pipe nipple extending through the
manhole wall, three inches into the manhole and at an elevation equal to the
top of the sewer pipe. Prior to the air test the ground water elevation shall
be determined by blowing air through the pipe nipple to clear it and then
connecting a clear plastic tube to the pipe nipple. The tube shall be suspended
vertically in the manhole and the ground water elevation determined by
observing the water level in the tube. The air test pressure shall be adjusted
to compensate for the maximum ground water level above the top of the sewer
pipe to be tested. After all tests are performed and the sewer is ready for
final acceptance, the pipe nipple shall be removed and the hole in the manhole
wall shall be plugged with hydraulic cement.
            If a sewer fails to pass any of the previously described tests, the
contractor shall determine the location of the leaks, repair them and retest
the sewer. The tests shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained.
      (2)   Pumping systems. Tests shall be conducted to verify performance
curves of each pumping device installed in the system.
      (3)   Force mains. When practicable, tests shall be made on sections
between valves, or sections not exceeding 2,000 feet in length. Dead ends,
bends and other fittings shall have a firm foundation and be securely blocked
against the trench walls before testing or completing the backfill as
specified.
         Before applying test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the
pipe. If necessary to accomplish this, taps shall be made at the points of
highest elevation, and such openings subsequently closed, prior to testing,
with tight threaded brass plugs.
         Test pressure shall be maintained at fifty pounds per square inch, by
pumping water into the pipe, for a period of at least one hour, and for such
longer time as may be required to permit a thorough examination to be made of
all exposed joints in the section of main being tested.
         Leakage, as measured by the quantity of water pumped into the pipe to
maintain the test pressure of fifty pounds per square inch during the test
period, shall not exceed a rate of fifty U.S. gallons per inch of diameter of
main per mile of pipe in twenty-four hours.

(Ord. 712. Passed 2-14-01.)
1041.05  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER FACILITIES.
   All storm water facilities connecting directly or indirectly to County
facilities shall be designed in accordance with the following minimum
requirements. The County Agency may deny a connection permit for a storm water
facility which is not in substantial compliance with these design and
construction standards and conditions, or for which a satisfactory compliance
schedule cannot be agreed upon.
   (a)   General Regulations.
      (1)   Construction shall not commence until all applicable local, State,
and Federal permits have been obtained.
      (2)   For items not specifically covered herein, the design, in general,
shall conform to the prevailing standards of the County Agency.
   (b)   Right-of-Way Requirements.
      (1)   The following minimum right-of-way widths are required for
established County drains and natural watercourses that will be utilized.
         A.   Open drains and watercourses whose maximum bank to bank width
exceeds thirty feet shall have a right-of-way to the extreme width of the
drain, plus thirty feet. The easement shall be centered on the centerline of
the drain or watercourse.
         B.   Open drains and watercourses whose maximum bank to bank width is
less than thirty feet shall have a right-of-way equal to the extreme width of
the drain, plus twenty-four feet. The easement shall be centered on the
centerline of the drain or watercourse.
         C.   Enclosed drains whose internal diameter is eight feet or less
shall have a right-of-way of twenty feet centered on the centerline of the
enclosure.
         D.   Enclosed drains whose internal diameter exceeds eight feet shall
have a right-of-way of twenty-five feet centered on the centerline of the
enclosure.
      (2)   The above widths shall govern generally. However, if  the County
Agency determines that additional right-of-way is required for proper
construction, or because of special circumstances, such facts shall be made
known after a review of the preliminary layout by the County Agency. Exceptions
to the above right-of-way requirements may be made only at the discretion of
the County Agency.
   (c)   Drainage Districts. In accordance with the Drain Code, Act 40 of the
Public Acts of 1956, as amended, the drainage of proposed subdivisions shall be
contained within the drainage district or drainage districts of the established
County drain, or if there is no established drainage district, then within the
limits of the natural drainage basin. When needed, minor alterations of the
legal limits of established drainage districts shall be made pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the Drain Code.
   (d)   Design Flows.
      (1)   Run-off determination. The rational method shall be used and is
expressed as: Q = CIA, where Q is the peak flow rate in cubic feet per second
(C.F.S.), C is the runoff coefficient, I is the rainfall intensity in inches
per hour (in./hr.), and A is the drainage area in acres.
Flow rates shall be based on adjusted runoff coefficients, incremented areas,
and adjusted rainfall intensities applicable to those segments of the
improvements which are being designed. Values for the various terms used in the
rational method formula shall be determined as follows:
         A.   A composite runoff coefficient based on the percentage of types
of surface with respect to the type of development shall be used.
         B.   Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves have been developed
by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, for the Detroit area.
Rainfall relationships extracted from Technical Paper #25, U.S. Department of
Commerce, Weather Bureau, December, 1955, shall be used.
         C.   The time of concentration of the design will vary with slope,
surface cover and the length of path of the surface flow. Other variables,
including anticipated rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity of the soil
and surface cover, will also affect the time of concentration. An initial inlet
time of concentration of fifteen minutes shall be used for multiple and
commercial/industrial land used, while twenty minutes shall be used for single-
family residential land use. The time of concentration for unimproved lands (in
minutes) should be derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture or F.A.A.
methods.
      (2)   Detention. Detention facilities will be required if the limitation
of discharge into the County drain or sewer is deemed necessary by the County
Agency.
   (e)   Sewers.

be used upon acceptance by the County  Agency.
      (3)   Bituminous type joint sealer shall be used, except that wherever
the design hydraulic gradient is above the top of the pipe or at locations
determined by the County Agency, internal rubber type gaskets shall be used.
      (4)   Concrete or riprap headwalls with erosion protection shall be
placed at the inlet and outlet ends of all sewer outlets and culverts in
accordance with prevailing County Agency standards.
      (5)   A minimum of three vertical feet of clearance from the top of the
pipe to the invert of a drain being crossed shall be maintained unless
otherwise approved by the County Agency.
   (f)   Construction Requirements.
      (1)   Proper construction practices shall be employed to protect water
courses from siltation and obstruction to flow.
      (2)   Construction materials and methods shall comply with the current
requirements of the County Agency.
(Ord. 712. Passed 2-14-01.)
1041.06  DISCHARGE OF WASTEWATER INTO PUBLIC SEWERS.
   This section has as its purpose the protection of the public health and
safety by abating and preventing pollution through the regulation and control
of the quantity and quality of wastewater admitted to or discharged into a POTW
owned or operated by the County of Wayne, wherein the County is the Control
Authority as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(a) and is administering the Federally
mandated Industrial Pretreatment Program. Its further purpose is to allow the
County of Wayne to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws as
required by the CWA of 1977, as amended, and the General Pretreatment
Regulation (40 CFR 403).
This section is enacted in accordance with the authority and requirements of
the FWPCA, the NREPA and the CDBPA.
   (a)   General Provisions. This section sets forth uniform requirements for
dischargers into the POTW, and enables the County of Wayne to protect the
public health in conformity with all applicable State and Federal laws relating
thereto. The objectives of this section, listed in priority order, are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
interfere with the normal operation of the system or which will interfere with
the use or disposal of the wastewater sludge by the POTW.
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which do
not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which will pass through the
system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
This section provides for the regulation of discharges into the POTW through
the issuance of permits, execution of binding contracts, and enforcement of the
Wayne County Sewer Use Ordinance.
   (b)   Requirements.
      (1)   Discharge prohibitions. Users introducing pollutants into a POTW,
whether or not the user is subject to other national Pretreatment Standards or
any National, State or Wayne County Pretreatment program requirement, shall be
subject to the following general and specific prohibitions:
         A.   General prohibitions. No user shall discharge or cause to be
discharged, directly or indirectly, any substance or wastewater which causes
pass-through or interference with the operation of the POTW.
         B.   Specific prohibitions. No user shall discharge or cause to be
discharged, to the POTW, directly or indirectly, any of the following
pollutants, substances or wastewater:
            1.   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature
or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction to cause
fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the operation of the
POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint
of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or sixty degrees Centigrade as determined
by test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21, as amended. Examples of these
substances include, but are not limited to: gasoline, kerosene, naphtha,
benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides,
chlorates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides.
            2.   Any solid or viscous substances which will solidify and cause
obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of
the wastewater treatment facilities, such as, but not limited to: grease, tar,
ashes, bones, cinders, sand, straw, metal, glass, wood, plastics, any material
which can be disposed of as trash or any insoluble particles greater than one-
half inch (½" or 1.27 CM) in any dimension.
            3.   Any wastewater having a pH lower than 5.0 or greater than 11.5
or having the potential to cause corrosive damage to the sewerage system
structures and equipment or health hazards to worker safety.
            4.   Any pollutant which either singly or by interaction with any
other substance may cause a public nuisance or result in the presence of toxic
gases, vapors or fumes within the sewerage system in a quantity that may cause
acute worker health and safety problems.
            5.   Any slugload of any pollutant, including oxygen demanding
pollutants, which is released in a single extraordinary discharge episode of
such volume or strength as to cause interference or pass-through.
            6.   Any wastewater containing radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration which exceed limits established by applicable
State or Federal regulations.
            7.   Any wastewater or heat which will inhibit biological activity
in the treatment plant(s) resulting in interference, but in no case in such
quantities that the temperature at the POTW treatment plant(s) exceeds forty
degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit) or with a temperature at the
introduction into the public sewer system which exceeds sixty-six degrees
Centigrade or 151 degrees Fahrenheit.
            8.   Any substance with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions.
            9.   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.
            10.   Sludges from pretreatment processes, potable water treatment,
municipal or industrial wastes, which are not completely amenable to
conventional wastewater treatment.
            11.   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or
treatment residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and
reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process.
            12.   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except as agreed to and
discharged at points designated by the County Agency.
            13.   Any wastewater which contains an insoluble substance having a
specific gravity greater than 2.65.
            14.   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit, the receiving water quality standards, the national air quality
standards or any other applicable permit, order, statute, regulation, or
limitation.
            15.   Any discharge from roof downspouts, surface drains or other
sources of uncontaminated surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or
building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public
sanitary sewer. This provision does not apply to an existing combined sewer
area.
            16.   Any wastewater which exceeds the local limitations set forth
in Appendix A following the text of this chapter, which is incorporated into
and made a part of this chapter, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)C.
hereof.
         C.   BOD mass-based limits.  For BOD, the County Agency reserves the
right to impose mass based limits in lieu of the concentration limits set forth
in Appendix A following the text of this chapter, where the County Agency
determines a mass based limitation is appropriate. A user will be considered to
be in compliance with the BOD limit contained in this chapter if the user
complies with the mass loading limitations and related conditions specified in
the user's Class D permit. Affirmative defenses available to a user are set
forth in paragraph (f)(9) hereof.
      (2)   Pretreatment requirements.
         A.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405-471, as amended, are hereby incorporated into this chapter and made a
part hereof.
Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with the most stringent provisions of this chapter, Federal Pretreatment
Standards, as established by 40 CFR Chapter N, Subpart I, State standards and
permit conditions, and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal
Pretreatment Regulations, and with any other pretreatment standards by
applicable deadlines.
Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
County Agency for review, and shall be approved by the County Agency before
construction of the facility. The review and approval of plans and operating
procedures does not relieve the industrial user from complying with the
provisions of this chapter and permit conditions. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and
approved by the County Agency prior to the industrial user's initiation of the
changes.
         B.   New source compliance deadline. New sources shall install and
have in operating condition and shall "start-up" all pollution control
equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning
to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety days),
new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
         C.   Conversion of mass limitations. When the limits in a categorical
pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit
of  production, the County Agency may convert the limits to equivalent
limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or
effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations
applicable to individual industrial users.
            Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(c)(3) and (c)(6) shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of
Section 307(d) of the Act and 40 CFR 403. Industrial users will be required to
comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical
standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (3)   Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by
an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall
ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with a pretreatment standard, local limitation or requirement. The
County Agency may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards, local limitations or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
      (4)   Spill prevention and slug control plan.
         A.   Industrial users shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of substances which may cause interference at the wastewater
treatment plant(s) by developing spill prevention plans. Where necessary,
facilities to prevent accidental discharges shall be provided and maintained at
the discharger's expense. Spill prevention plans shall be approved by the
County Agency prior to construction.
            County review and approval of such plans in no way relieves the
discharger of any liability associated with the efficiency or inefficiency of
the facilities.
         B.   The County Agency shall evaluate each significant industrial user
at least once every two years, and other industrial users as necessary, to
determine whether a slug control plan is needed. If the County Agency decides a
slug control plan is needed, plans for such a plan shall be submitted to the
County for approval. Approval of such plans shall not relieve the industrial
user from complying with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the use,
storage or transportation of hazardous substances. Slug control plans shall
contain at least the following:
            1.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine
batch discharges.
            2.   List of chemicals stored.
            3.   Procedures to immediately notify the County of slug
discharges, including any discharges prohibited in paragraph (b)(1) hereof,
with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days.
            4.   Provisions for preventing adverse impact from accidental
spills, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
chemicals, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, containment structures, procedures for containing toxic
organic pollutants and emergency response measures and equipment.
         C.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
discharger's premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug
or accidental discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which
will cause interference with the POTW or a pass-through. Employers shall
instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect
to emergency notification procedures.
      (5)   Notification.
         A.   Notification of changed discharge. All users shall promptly
notify the County Agency in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in its discharge, including all of the following, if
applicable:
            1.   Ground waters that are purged for remedial action programs.
            2.   Ground waters containing pollutants that infiltrate into the
sewers.
            3.   The listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the
user has submitted initial notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)D. hereof.
         B.   Notification of slug or spill discharge.
            1.   In the case of any discharge in violation of this chapter or
permit conditions, and in the case of any discharge that could cause problems
to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined in this chapter, the
industrial user shall notify within one hour of becoming aware of such
discharge the County of the discharge by telephone at the telephone number
listed in the user’s wastewater discharge permit. The notification shall
include:
               a.   The date, time, location and duration of the discharge;
               b.   The type of waste, including concentration and volume; and
               c.   Any corrective actions taken by the user.
            2.   Within five days following such a discharge the user shall
submit a written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures
that will be taken by the user to prevent similar future discharges.
            3.   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability resulting from the discharge, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed under this chapter or other applicable State or Federal
law.
         C.   Self-monitoring violations. When sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the County Agency
within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
repeat sampling and pollutant analysis and submit, in writing, the results of
this second analysis within thirty days of the first violation, except if:
            1.   The County Agency performs sampling at the facility at a
frequency of at least once per month; or
            2.   The County Agency performs sampling between the time the user
performs the initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of this sampling.
         D.   Hazardous waste notification. Industrial users shall notify the
County Agency, the USEPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the
State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of
a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under
40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR 261, the USEPA Hazardous Waste Number, the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other), and other requirements set forth in 40
CFR 403.12(p)(1).
         E.   Notification of operating upsets.
            1.   If a discharger experiences an upset in operations which
places that discharger in a temporary state of non-compliance with this chapter
or with a condition of its wastewater discharge permit, the discharger shall
inform the County Agency within twenty-four hours of first becoming aware. The
discharger shall file a written report with the County Agency within five days.
That report shall specify:
               a.   Description of the upset, its cause, and impact on the
discharger's compliance status.
               b.   Duration of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
of non-compliance, and if the non-compliance continues, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to resume.
               c.   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of non-compliance.
            2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of the Michigan Administrative Code R 323.2303(3) are met.
            3.   In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
            4.   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges
to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards and/or local limits upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost
or fails.
         F.   Notification of bypass.
            1.   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does
not violate any pretreatment standards, requirements or local limits, but only
if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs F.2. and 3. hereof.
            2.   Notice.
               a.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the County Agency, if possible at least
ten days before the date of the bypass.
               b.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards,
requirements or local limits to the County Agency within twenty-four hours from
the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written report
shall also be provided within five days of the time
the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written report shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The County Agency may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty-four hours.
            3.   Prohibition of bypass.
               a.   Bypass is prohibited, and the County Agency may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance  during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph
(b)(5)F.2. hereof.
               b.   The County Agency may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the County Agency determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (b)(5)F.3. hereof.
      (6)   Records retention. A discharger subject to this chapter shall
retain, preserve and make available upon request of the County, State or USEPA,
for no less than three years, all records, books, documents, memoranda,
reports, correspondence and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a discharger in
connection with its discharge.
         All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of
conciliation action or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought
by the County Agency pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the
discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of
limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
         All users shall also retain any records when requested to do so by a
representative of the USEPA, State or County.
      (7)   Sample analysis. All sampling and analysis of the characteristics
or samples, to which reference is made in this chapter, shall be performed
pursuant to laboratory procedures set forth in 40 CFR 136, "Guidelines for
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants," or methods set forth
in the latest edition, at the time of analysis, of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater" prepared and published jointly by the
APHA, AWWA and WEF.
         Where these two references are in disagreement on procedures for the
analysis of a specific pollutant, the methods given in 40 CFR 136 shall be
followed.
         Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling and analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the
Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant
in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the Administrator.
      (8)   Confidential information.
         A.   Information on an industrial user derived from written reports,
questionnaires, permits, monitoring programs and inspections shall be available
to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless at the
time of submission to the County Agency the user specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the County Agency that release of such information would
disclose trade secrets or secret processes of the industrial user.
The user furnishing the report must clearly mark "CONFIDENTIAL" any portion of
a report which contains trade secrets or secret processes. Confidential
information shall not be released to the public, but shall be made available
upon request to the State and the USEPA for uses related to this chapter, the
NPDES permit or the pretreatment program in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. However, the
information provided shall be treated as confidential by the aforementioned
agencies.
         B.   All effluent data submitted to the County Agency will not be
recognized as confidential.
         C.   Requests regarding right to inspect, copy or receive copies of
all information with respect to an industrial user, on file with the County
Agency, shall be processed in accordance with the County of Wayne, Freedom of
Information Act Policy And Procedures (Executive Order 1997-2) and the Michigan
Freedom of Information Act (M.C.L.A. 15.231 et seq.).
      (9)   Right of entry. Authorized representatives of the County, the State
and USEPA, upon presentation of credentials, shall have the right to enter the
premises of any user who may be subject to the requirements of this chapter for
the purpose of inspecting, sampling, and examining records or copying records
in accordance with Section
1041.07.  Denial of entry shall constitute a violation of this chapter and
subject the user to enforcement action.
      (10)   Monitoring facilities.
         A.   A permittee shall provide and operate, at his own expense, a
monitoring facility to enable the County Agency to inspect, sample, and measure
the flow of each sewer discharge. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on
the discharger’s premises, unless the County Agency determines that such
location would be impractical.
         B.   There shall be ample space in or near a monitoring facility to
enable County Agency personnel to take and to prepare accurate samples for
analysis.
         C.   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with the County Agency’s standards and all applicable local
construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed
within 120 days of receipt of a permit by the discharger.
         D.   The permit holder shall maintain, at his expense, the facility
sampling and measuring equipment where required, at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition.
      (11)   Inspection and sampling.
         A.   The County Agency may inspect the facility of a user to determine
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The user shall allow the
County Agency or its representatives to enter the facility of the user at all
reasonable hours. The County Agency shall have the right to set up on the
user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
         B.   Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification before entry upon their facility, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with their security so that, upon presentation of
identification, personnel from the County Agency, the MDEQ and the USEPA will
be permitted to enter, without delay. The County Agency also reserves the right
to copy a discharger’s records, pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12 (o)(2).
   (c)   Charges and Fees.
      (1)   Purpose. The County Agency shall recommend to the County Commission
that it adopt a written rate policy, and, from time to time, set rates and
charges in accordance with provisions of the sewer service agreements existing
between the County Agency and the City of Southgate or other entities signatory
thereto. These rates and charges shall be designed to recover from the parties
and customer classes benefited the full actual cost of services rendered.
Further, the County Agency shall require that a user charge system which is
acceptable to the State and to the USEPA be instituted by the City of
Southgate, where applicable.
         It is the purpose of this section to provide for the payment of fees
from dischargers to the County wastewater disposal system, to compensate the
County for the cost of administration of the pretreatment program established
herein and to recover treatment costs for excess compatible pollutants.
         Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the City of Southgate
from setting such fees and charges as are necessary for the City of Southgate
to recover the cost of services with respect to a locally-owned sewage system.
      (2)   Description of charges and fees. The County shall collect charges
and fees, including late fees and interest, directly from the affected
industrial users for at least the following:
         A.   Annual industrial surveillance fees.
         B.   Surcharges for compatible pollutants discharged in excessive
concentrations as detailed in paragraph (c)(4) hereof.
         C.   To recover actual additional costs it may incur in connection
with inspecting and enforcement, implementation of the industrial pretreatment
program, sampling, testing, handling and treating the wastes not covered by
existing wastewater charges in addition to the annual industrial surveillance
fee referred to above.
         D.   Cost of handling and treating wastewater into the sewer, not
otherwise provided.
The above charges and fees are separate from any sewage or excess sewage fees
collected pursuant to Michigan Public Act 185 of 1957.
      (3)   Non-residential user fee. The County shall adopt as a part of its
schedule of rates and charges, a nonresidential user fee to be collected by the
local contract communities in conjunction with the basic sewage disposal
charges from all nonresidential users as identified by the City of Southgate.
These charges are to be paid to the County as part of the sewage disposal
billing process.
      (4)   Surcharges. Users discharging wastewater containing excess
compatible pollutants may be assessed a surcharge to recover the additional
costs incurred for treating said excess compatible pollutants. The threshold
concentrations for BOD, TSS and P are as follows:
   BOD 275 mg/l
   TSS 350 mg/l
   P 12 mg/l
         These surcharges shall be calculated and assessed in accordance with a
surcharge policy as approved by the County Agency. Such surcharges shall be
credited to the appropriate treatment facilities operation fund.
      (5)   Rate review. Such charges and fees may be changed from time to time
by the County Agency with County Commission approval, to provide for recovery
of the full actual cost of these programs from the users thereof. Before
submitting a proposed change for County Commission approval, the County Agency
shall provide all proposed fee and surcharge changes, and shall provide an
opportunity to review the basis for them, including necessary County financial
statements, and to provide an opportunity to the municipalities to object or
comment upon those proposed changes in fees and surcharges. The municipalities
shall be given the opportunity to review pertinent County records.
         County books and records shall be kept in accordance with generally
accepted accounting standards.
      (6)   Late filing fees. A user failing to timely submit any reports as
required by subsection (e) hereof, or as required by a permit issued in
accordance with this chapter, on the date said report is required to be
submitted, shall be subject to a late filing fee as set forth in the Schedule
of Rates and Charges as adopted by the County for sewerage systems owned and
operated by the County, from time to time.
         Failure to pay the late filing fees shall subject the user to
enforcement actions as determined appropriate by the County  Agency, including
the revocation of any permits issued in accordance with this chapter.
   (d)   Wastewater Discharge Permits.
      (1)   Permit application.
         A.   Prior to issuing an industrial or commercial Certificate of
Occupancy, a community contracting for wastewater services with the County
Agency shall require each industrial and commercial discharger to file an
industrial/commercial waste questionnaire with the County Agency. The
questionnaire shall serve as the application for obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit. All industrial users proposing to connect to or to discharge
sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes to the POTW shall, at least ninety
days prior to said connection, complete and file a questionnaire in the form
prescribed by the County Agency, with a copy to the City of Southgate.
         B.   The County Agency will evaluate the data furnished by the user
and may require additional information to be submitted. After full evaluation
of the data furnished, the County Agency shall determine whether the facility
is a significant industrial user (SIU) or a non-significant industrial user.
            1.   All significant industrial users, as defined by this chapter
and 40 CFR 403.3, as amended, shall be required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit from the County Agency in order to discharge any wastewater
into the County sewerage system.
            2.   If the industrial/commercial waste questionnaire evaluation
determines that the industrial user is a non-significant industrial user, a
permit will not be required.
            3.   Any user who discharges wastewater, industrial wastes or other
wastes to a sewer tributary to a wastewater facility subject to the
jurisdiction or the County of Wayne or to its POTW's, without first complying
with the provisions of this section, is subject to fines, imprisonment and
other sanctions as provided in this chapter.

      (3)   Additional permit conditions. In the event that the County Agency
determines that a user is discharging pollutants in quality, quantity or in
locations that can cause problems to the POTW or the receiving waters, the
County Agency has the authority to develop and enforce effluent limits
applicable to the user.
      (4)   Permit duration. Wastewater discharge permits are issued for a
five-year period unless site specific constraints dictate a shorter time
period, but in no case shall the duration exceed five years.
         Existing permittees shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of
ninety days prior to the expiration of their existing permit. Upon timely
application for reissuance of a permit in accordance with this paragraph, the
expired permit shall be automatically extended until a final decision regarding
the application is made by the County Agency.
      (5)   Permit issuance and reissuance. The County Agency shall issue, or
reissue, as the case may be, a wastewater discharge permit in draft form to the
user for a thirty-day review and comment period. During this period, the user
may submit written comments on the draft permit to the County Agency. After the
thirty-day review and comment period and the County Agency’s consideration of
any comments received, the final permit may be issued. The user may appeal any
final permit pursuant to Section
1041.08.
      (6)   Permit modification. The County Agency may modify a wastewater
discharge permit in order to:
         A.   Require compliance with National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards. Permit modification shall occur within nine months of the
promulgation of the applicable standard. Where an industrial user subject to a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard has not previously submitted a

         G.   Reflect changes in the monitoring location.
         H.   Address a user’s noncompliance with portions of an existing
permit.
         I.   For any other reason, if the County Agency reasonably believes
the modification is necessary to ensure either that the POTW complies with its
NPDES permit or that the POTW does not negatively affect the receiving water
quality standards, the national air quality standards or any other applicable
permit, order, statute, regulation or limitation.
            The permittee shall be given written notice of any proposed changes
in its permit, at least thirty days prior to the effective date of such change,
unless a shorter time is necessary to protect the treatment plant, protect
human health or the environment.
      (7)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued to a
specific discharger for a specific operation and may not be assigned or
transferred to another discharger or to another location without thirty days
prior notice to the County Agency of the change, and the written approval of
the County Agency.
      (8)   Special condition discharge authorization. A user that desires to
discharge unique wastewater which is not currently covered by a Class "D"
wastewater discharge permit for a limited time period may be granted a special
condition discharge authorization by the County Agency. This authorization
shall apply to discharges, determined by the County Agency, as having no
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operations or violating
any provision of this chapter. It may contain the following conditions as
deemed necessary:
         A.   Duration of authorization (in no case more than five years).
         B.   Statement of nontransferability.

   (e)   Reporting.
      (1)   Baseline monitoring reports. Within 180 days after the effective
date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40
CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such
categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to a County Agency shall be required to submit to the County Agency a
report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1) to (7), as
amended. At least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources,
and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the County
Agency a report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1) to
(5). New sources shall also be required to include in this report information
on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable
pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information
requested in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4) and (5), as amended.
         Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
submit an additional baseline monitoring report ninety days prior to commencing
discharge from any new process regulated by said standards.
Any changes to information requested under this section shall be submitted to
the County Agency within sixty days of any such changes.
      (2)   Compliance date report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the
case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall
submit to the County Agency a report containing the information described in 40
CFR 403.12(b)(4) to (6), as amended. Where equivalent mass or concentration
limits are established by the County Agency for a user, this report shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. Where a
user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, the report shall include
the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The report
shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user.
      (3)   Periodic compliance reports. The reports required by this section
shall be based on the user's self-monitoring, performed during the period
covered by the report, and performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(7)
hereof.
      (4)   Categorical industrial users.
         A.   Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after
the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new
source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the
County Agency, on a quarterly basis, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the County Agency, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
         B.   The County Agency may impose mass limitations on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards, or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the
report required by paragraph (e)(4)A. hereof shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the County,
of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards.
         C.   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the County Agency in accordance with the procedures in 40
CFR 403.6(c), as amended, the report required by 40 CFR 403.6(e)(1) shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all
other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by 40 CFR 403.6(e)(1) shall include
the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      (5)   Significant non-categorical industrial users. Significant
noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the County Agency once per
quarter, on dates specified in the wastewater discharge permits, a report
detailing the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants and other
pertinent information as requested by the County Agency. The report shall be
submitted on a form provided by the County Agency.
      (6)   More frequent monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the
reporting requirements in paragraph (e)(3) hereof monitors or samples any
pollutant or parameter more frequently than required by the County Agency using
the procedures prescribed in paragraph (b)(7) hereof, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in any report submitted to the County Agency
pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) hereof.
      (7)   Signatory requirements. Pursuant to Michigan Administrative Code R.
323.2310(11) and R. 323.2311(2)(b)(ii), the reports required under paragraphs
(e)(1) through (3) hereof shall include the following certification statement
and shall be signed by an authorized representative, as defined in this
chapter:
         I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.
      (8)   Self-monitoring. Significant industrial users may be required to
perform self-monitoring of their wastewater discharge. Any required self-
monitoring program shall be described in the user’s discharge permit and shall
include designation of the sampling location, frequency of sampling, number of
samples, types of samples, type of analysis required, standards for testing and
increased reporting schedules. A self-monitoring program may also be the result
of enforcement action taken by the County against the user, and shall be a part
of any subsequent conciliation agreement or administrative orders.
         A user subject to the self-monitoring requirements of this section
shall also be required to make notification and resample upon becoming aware of
a violation, in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)C. hereof.
      (9)   Timing. Written reports and/or notifications shall be deemed to
have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports and/or notifications
which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the
U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (f)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Notification of violation. Upon determination of a violation of
this chapter or a wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, the County
shall take the appropriate enforcement action which may include a written
notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt from the County Agency of a
written notice of violation by a user, the user shall submit to the County
Agency an explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction
and prevention of the cause of the violation. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any previous or future violations.
      (2)   Notice of non-compliance. If the County Agency finds that a
discharger is in significant noncompliance, as defined in this chapter, with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, permit requirements and/or local
limits, the County Agency may serve or cause to be served upon that discharger
a written notice, either personally or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt required, stating the nature of the alleged violation. The notice shall
set forth a time, date and location for a conciliation meeting.
         The County Agency shall also forthwith notify the local contracting
community of that meeting and shall request that its representatives attend.
The discharger shall attend the meeting and present a corrective plan of action
to resolve the noncompliance. The corrective plan of action and related
compliance schedule may be set forth in a mutually agreed upon conciliation
agreement to be signed by the discharger and the County Agency.
         If, however, a mutual agreement cannot be reached or the discharger
refuses to sign the conciliation agreement, the County Agency may issue a
unilateral administrative order to force timely compliance with specified
requirements and/or permit limitations.
      (3)   Compliance schedule progress report. A discharger subject to a
compliance schedule resulting from any enforcement action, or as a condition of
its wastewater discharge permit, shall submit a progress report to the County
Agency no later than fourteen days following each increment milestone date
specified in the compliance schedule. This report shall disclose whether the
user complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason
for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to the
original compliance schedule.
         In no event, however, may more than nine months elapse between
progress reports. If a user acts in full accordance with a compliance schedule,
as approved and adopted in accordance with this section, that user is deemed to
be in compliance only for the parameters affected by the compliance schedule.
Exceedences of additional parameter limitations shall be considered violations
and subject to enforcement action.
      (4)   Administrative orders.
         A.   Show cause order. The County may order any user which causes or
contributes to a violation of this chapter, or a wastewater discharge permit or
an order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general
partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user
appears as noticed, enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate. The
hearing may be closed to the public at the request of the user for good cause
shown. Request to close the meeting shall be made in writing and received by
the County at least twenty-four hours in advance. Failure to comply with a show
cause order shall constitute a further violation of this chapter and subject
the user to further enforcement action.
         B.   Consent order. As a result of the show cause order and subsequent
hearing, a consent order may be issued by the County. The user assumes
responsibility for its non-compliance and is willing (in good faith) to correct
the cause(s) of the non-compliance. The order is an agreement, mutually
acceptable to both the County and the user, which contains a compliance
schedule, stipulated fines, penalties or remedial actions and signatures of
both parties. This order prohibits future violations and shall provide for
corrective actions by the user.
         C.   Compliance order. When the County finds that a user has violated
or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, the
County may unilaterally issue an order to the industrial user responsible for
the discharge, directing that, following a specified time period, further
enforcement action shall be taken unless adequate treatment facilities, devices
or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated,
and compliance is achieved. Orders may also contain stipulated fines or
penalties, compliance schedules subject to the provision of paragraph (f)(3)
hereof, and other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate
to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment
technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices. The stipulated
penalties shall be in such amounts as are determined necessary to compensate
the public for damages difficult to quantify related to injury to the
environment and for the recovery from the violator of economic benefits
realized by noncompliance and for the purpose of deterring future violations or
noncompliance.
         D.   Cease and desist orders. When the County determines a user has
violated or continues to violate this chapter, a discharge permit or an order
issued hereunder, the County may issue an order to cease and desist all illegal
or authorized discharges immediately.
            1.   In instances of an emergency, including, but not limited to,
imminent danger to the public health, the POTW, or the environment, the order
to cease and desist may be given by telephone. This action shall be followed by
a written order to cease and desist.
            2.   In non-emergency situations, the cease and desist order may be
used to suspend or permanently revoke wastewater discharge permits.
            3.   The cease and desist order may order the industrial user to
take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and terminating the discharge.
      (5)   Reserved.
      (6)   Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. The County
Agency may, for good cause, suspend the wastewater treatment service and the
wastewater discharge permit of a discharger if the County Agency finds that an
actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an imminent or
substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to
the environment, or an interference or pass-through. A discharger who is
notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or the
discharger's wastewater discharge permit, shall, within a reasonable period of
time, as determined by the County Agency, cease all discharges.
         If a discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension order
within the specified time, the County Agency shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving waters, or endangerment to any individuals.
The County shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the County's satisfaction that the endangerment has passed,
unless termination proceedings are initiated against the user.
         A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a full report to the County
Agency within five days of the incident. This report shall be a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. The information in this report
shall be considered during any related action by the County Agency.
         Local communities whose wastewater is transported or treated by the
facilities of the County Agency may join with the County Agency in the
enforcement action and may take other action to effectuate this chapter.
         Failure of the contracting community to join in the enforcement action
shall not limit the County's authority to enforce this chapter and the
provisions of this section as to any discharger.
      (7)   Revocation of wastewater discharge permit. The County may, with
written notice, revoke the discharge permit for the following reasons:
         A.   Violation of the terms and conditions of the permit, local
ordinances, State and Federal laws, statutes and regulations.
         B.   Failure to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of the discharge.
         C.   Failure to report significant changes in wastewater constituents
and characteristics.
         D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the permittee premises by County
personnel for the purpose(s) of inspection or monitoring.
         E.   Failure to pay fines, penalties or costs incurred by the County,
pursuant to this subsection.
            Noncompliant industrial users shall be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater discharge permit and be given an opportunity to
show cause under paragraph (f)(4)A. hereof why the proposed action should not
be taken.
      (8)   Annual publication. A list of all users who have been determined to
be in significant noncompliance with any provisions of this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the previous
publication shall be annually published by the County Agency in the largest
daily newspaper published in the municipality in which the County Agency is
located. All users identified in a proposed publication shall be provided a
copy of that proposed notice at least thirty days before publication and
provided with an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy.
      (9)   Affirmative defenses. A user shall have an affirmative defense in
any action brought against it alleging a violation of the prohibitions pursuant
to Michigan Administrative Code R. 323.2303(3), where the user can demonstrate
that it meets the criteria set forth in both of the following:
         A.   It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would
cause pass-through or interference.
         B.   A local discharge limit designed to prevent pass-through or
interference was developed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c) for each
pollutant in the user’s discharge that caused pass-through or interference, and
the user was in compliance with each local discharge limit directly before and
during the pass-through or interference, or if a local limit designed to
prevent pass-through or interference has not been developed in accordance with
40 CFR 403.5(c) for the pollutant that caused the pass-through or interference,
the user’s discharge directly before and during the pass-through or
interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the
user’s prior discharge activity when the publicly owned treatment works was
regularly in compliance with its national pollutant discharge elimination
system permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable
requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal.
      (10)   Judicial proceedings. The County may, through its office of
corporation counsel, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable
relief in Wayne County Circuit Court, in any instances of conduct contrary to
the provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this section is intended to
supersede any applicable actions or penalties by the State or the USEPA or to
prevent the County from enforcing the requirements of other sections of this
chapter.
      (11)   Injunctive relief; public nuisance. Whenever an industrial user
has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or a permit
or order issued hereunder, the County, through its office of corporation
counsel, may petition a court of legal jurisdiction for the issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting in any manner
the powers of the County Health Officer, and if any unsanitary conditions
exist, the same is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall be abated
in accordance with the provisions of applicable law.
      (12)   Municipal civil infractions.
         A.   Violation; Municipal civil infraction. Except as provided by
paragraph (f)(13) hereof, a person who violates any provision of this chapter
(including, without limitation, any rules, regulations, licenses, permits,
orders, agreements or determinations issued, adopted or entered by the County
under this chapter) is responsible for a County Municipal civil infraction,
subject to payment of a civil fine of not less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) per day for each infraction and not more than twenty-seven thousand,
five hundred dollars ($27,500) per day for each infraction, plus costs,
expenses and other sanctions; except that a person who violates any of the
following sections of this chapter shall be subject to payment of a civil fine
of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day and not more than
twenty-seven thousand, five hundred dollars ($27,500) per day for each
infraction, plus costs, expenses and other sanctions:
            1.   Section 1041.04(e)(1)A.1., (e)(1)B.2., (h) or (j);
            2.   Section 1041.05(a); or

12. or 14; (b)(2)B.; (b)(3); (b)(5)F.; (b)(9); (d)(1)B.1.; (e)(1); or (e)(2).
         B.   Repeat offenses; increased fines. Increased fines may be imposed
for repeat offenses. As used in this section, "repeat offense" means a second
(or any subsequent) Municipal civil infraction violation of the same
requirement or provision of this chapter (i) committed by a person within any
twelve-month period and (ii) for which the person admits responsibility or is
determined to be responsible. The increased fine for a repeat offense under
this chapter shall be as follows:
            1.   Except as provided by paragraph (f)(12)B.2. hereof, the fine
for any offense that is a first repeat offense shall be not less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000), plus costs; and the fine for any offense that is a
second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat offense shall be not less than
two thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500), plus costs, expenses and other
sanctions.
            2.   For violations of the following sections of this chapter, the
fine for any offense that is a first repeat offense shall be not less than two
thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500), plus costs; and the fine for any
offense that is a second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat offense shall
be not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000), plus costs, expenses and other
sanctions:
               a.   Section 1041.04(e)(1)A.1., (e)(1)B.2., (h) or (j);
               b.   Section 1041.05(a); or
               c.   Section 1041.06(b)(1)A., (b)(1)B.1., 2., 4., 5., 6., 7.,
8., 12 or 14; (b)(2)B.; (b)(3); (b)(5)F.; (b)(9); (d)(1)B.1.; (e)(1); or (e)
(2).
         C.   Amount of fines.
            1.   Municipal civil infraction citations. Subject to the minimum
fine amounts specified in paragraphs (12)A. and B. hereof, the following
factors shall be considered by the court in determining the amount of a
Municipal civil infraction fine following the issuance of a Municipal civil
infraction citation for a violation of this chapter: the type, nature,
severity, frequency, duration, preventability, potential and actual effect, and
economic benefit to the violator (such as delayed or avoided costs or
competitive advantage) of a violation; the violator's recalcitrance or efforts
to comply; the economic impacts of the fine on the violator; and such other
matters as justice may require. A violator shall bear the burden of
demonstrating the presence and degree of any mitigating factors to be
considered in determining the amount of a fine. However, mitigating factors
shall not be considered unless it is determined that the violator has made all
good faith efforts to correct and terminate all violations.
            2.   Municipal civil infraction notices; schedule of fines.
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the amount of a
municipal civil infraction fine due to the County in response to the issuance
by the County of a Municipal civil infraction notice for a violation as
provided by paragraph (12)A. hereof, shall be according to the following
schedule:
               a.   For a violation of any provision of this chapter (except as
provided by paragraph C.2.b. hereof):

                  (C)   Second repeat offense (or any subsequent repeat
offense):  $5,000.
      For any fine not paid in full at the Wayne County Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau within thirty days of the time specified for appearance in
the Municipal civil infraction violation notice, the fine amount due shall
automatically be double the amounts listed immediately above. A copy of this
schedule shall be posted at the Wayne County Municipal Ordinance Violations
Bureau.
         D.   Authorized County officials. The following persons are
"authorized County officials" for purposes of issuing Municipal civil
infraction citations (directing alleged violators to appear in district court)
or Municipal civil infraction violation notices (directing alleged violators to
appear at the Wayne County Municipal Ordinance Violations Bureau) for
violations under this chapter: the Director of the Wayne County Department of
Environment (and the Director's designees); and any County police officer.
         E.   Definitions. As used in this subsection:
            1.   "Act" means Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of 1961 ("Revised
Judicature Act of 1961"), as amended.

by this chapter.
            3.   "Municipal civil infraction" means an act or omission that is
prohibited by this chapter, but which is not a crime under this chapter, and
for which civil sanctions, including, without limitation, fines, damages,
expenses and costs, may be ordered, as authorized by Chapter 87 of the Act. A
Municipal civil infraction is not a lesser included offense of a violation of
this chapter that is a criminal offense.
            4.   "Municipal civil infraction action" means a civil action in
which the defendant is alleged to be responsible for a Municipal civil
infraction.
            5.   "Municipal civil infraction citation" means a written

adopted by the County, as authorized under Sections 8396 and 8707(6) of the
Act.
         F.   Other requirements and procedures. Except as otherwise provided
by this section, the requirements and procedures for commencing Municipal civil
infraction actions; issuance and service of Municipal civil infraction
citations and notices; determination and collection of court-ordered fines,
costs and expenses; appearances and payment of fines and costs; failure to
answer, appear or pay fines; disposition of fines, costs and expenses paid; and
other matters regarding Municipal civil infractions; shall be as set forth in
Chapter 2 ("Municipal Civil Infractions") of the Wayne County Code.
      (13)   Criminal penalties; imprisonment. Any person who (1) at the time

discretion of the court. If a violation is committed by a person who acts or
fails to act on behalf of a corporation or a partnership, that person shall be
held personally liable for the fine or imprisonment, or both.
      (14)   Separate offenses. Each act of violation, and each day or portion
of a day that a violation of this chapter, or of any permit, license, order,
notice or determination issued, made or entered into under this chapter is
permitted to exist or occur, constitutes a separate offense and shall be
punishable as provided by this chapter.
      (15)   Recovery of costs. In addition to the civil and criminal penalties
prescribed by this chapter, a user is liable for all costs incurred if  the
user:
         A.   Is in violation of its permit, an order, this chapter,
prohibitions or mandates;
         B.   Causes a deposit, or obstruction;
         C.   Causes damage to disposal system equipment, a sewer or the POTW;
         D.   Impairs the treatment process, or precipitates extraordinary
treatment procedures; or
         E.   Discharges pollutants which enter the receiving waters by either
POTW pass-through or through an overflow facility resulting in a NPDES permit
violation.
            The County Agency shall determine all costs incurred as a result of
the user’s action, including the amount of that loss, NPDES fines, if
applicable, and the expense of the cleaning, repair and replacement work needed
to remedy that damage, and subsequent administrative charges, and shall bill
the user for the full amount of all such costs and expenses. Failure to pay
that amount, in full, within thirty days after receipt of the billing, shall
constitute grounds for the immediate revocation of that user’s wastewater
discharge permit. The County Agency may commence the appropriate proceeding to
recover such costs and expenses.
   (g)   Miscellaneous Provisions.
      (1)   Removal credits. Where applicable, the County Agency may elect to
initiate a program of removal credits as part of this chapter to reflect the
POTW's ability to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR 403.7, as
amended.
      (2)   Net/gross calculations. Categorical pretreatment standards and
local limits may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the
industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section.
         Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants
must make application to the County Agency. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake) if the requirements of
40 CFR 403.15, as amended, are met.
      (3)   Hauled-in wastewater. Hauled-in waste and septic tank waste which
is hauled or transported within or into the service area may be introduced into
the County POTW only at locations and such times as designated by the County
Agency, provided:
         A.   Such waste shall not violate this chapter, including paragraph
(b)(1) hereof, or any requirements established by the County Agency. A waste
analysis may be required prior to discharge when a prohibited discharge is
suspected.
         B.   All dischargers shall be subject to the provisions of the Hauled
Wastewater and Septage Policy as established by the County Agency.
      (4)   Pollution prevention. The County shall encourage users to
voluntarily adopt pollution prevention measures.
      (5)   Mercury Reduction Plans. The County Authority may require a user to
develop, submit for approval and implement a Mercury Reduction Plan ("MRP") if
the user discharges wastewater that will, or has a reasonable potential to,
exceed the quantification level for mercury, as set forth in Appendix A
following the text of this chapter. Such Plan shall include a written
commitment by the user to reduce the concentration of mercury in the user's
effluent to concentrations below the quantification level within three years of
the implementation of the approval of the Plan by the County Agency. The Plan
shall be submitted on a form provided by the County Agency. The user must
submit to the County Agency a semiannual report on the status on the mercury
reduction efforts.
         To ensure compliance with the local discharge limit for mercury as set
forth in Appendix A following the text of this chapter, a user may elect to
implement a Mercury Reduction Plan.
(Ord. 712. Passed 2-14-01.)
1041.07  AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF INSPECTORS AND PROTECTION OF OWNERS.
   This section defines the extent and limitations of the authority of the
County Agency to police wastewater systems connected to County wastewater
facilities to insure compliance with this chapter.
   (a)   Authority.
      (1)   An authorized representative of the County Agency who bears proper
credentials and identification shall be promptly permitted to enter non-
residential properties which discharge into the POTW for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing of wastewater and
affiliated equipment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   An authorized representative of the County Agency who bears proper
credentials and identification shall be promptly permitted to enter all private
properties through which the County or local municipality holds an easement,
for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the wastewater transmission
facilities which lie within that easement.
   (b)   Duties. While performing necessary work on private properties pursuant
to subsection (a) hereof, an authorized representative of the County Agency
shall observe and comply with all safety rules applicable to the premises as

Section of the County Agency (IPP Representative) to schedule a conciliation
meeting with the appellant, as soon as practicable, at the mutual convenience
of the parties, to resolve the dispute.
   (b)   Conciliation Meeting.
      (1)   If a conciliation meeting is held, it shall be open to all
interested parties and their representatives. The meeting, if necessary, may be
adjourned to a mutually acceptable date or dates.
      (2)   If the appellant or IPP representative determines that the dispute
cannot be resolved through the conciliation meeting process, the parties shall
so inform the Director in writing and request a hearing in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof. If future conciliation meetings are no longer needed,
the Agency head, or his or her designee, shall so notify the parties involved
and issue a decision within fifteen days, in writing, by mail, to the
interested parties to the dispute.
      (3)   If it is determined by all interested parties and the IPP
representative that the dispute has been satisfactorily resolved through the
conciliation meeting process hereto, within thirty days of the last
conciliation meeting, the IPP representative shall reduce such resolution to
the form of a written agreement or order for signature by the interested
parties
   (c)   Hearing Procedure.
      (1)   In the event a hearing is required pursuant to subsection (a) or
paragraph (b)(2) hereof, the Director shall promptly appoint a disinterested
hearing officer of suitable qualifications to conduct an administrative hearing
and to receive testimony and evidence presented by the aggrieved party. The
hearing officer shall also receive testimony and evidence from the County or
others as he or she deems necessary.
      (2)   The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing and file a written
report of said hearing with the Director within thirty days of his or her
appointment. The hearing officer shall have the right to extend this thirty-day
period for good cause. However, in such event, his or her report will be
submitted to the Director within fifteen days of the conclusion of the hearing
and the taking of testimony and evidence.
      (3)   The hearing officer’s report shall include a brief statement of
factual matters at issue, the nature of the testimony and evidence received and
shall include a recommendation to either uphold or modify the decision or
action in question on such terms as the hearing officer deems equitable.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the hearing officer’s report, the Director shall
render his or her decision in writing within fifteen days of the receipt of the
report. In any event, the Director shall not be bound by the recommendation of
the hearing officer. The decision of the Director shall be final and
enforceable at law, unless the appeal involves a citation and a subsequent
appeal is made within sixty days and the County Commission grants a review of
the Director's decision. After the review, the County Commission may affirm,
dismiss, or modify the Director's decision. The decision of the County
Commission shall be final.
         A person or municipality aggrieved by a final decision of the Director
or the County Commission may petition to the Wayne County Circuit Court for
judicial review. The petition shall be filed not later than sixty days
following the receipt of the final decision. An aggrieved person or
municipality shall exhaust all administrative remedies provided in this section
before seeking judicial review.
      (5)   With respect to the hearing conducted, the hearing officer shall
not be bound strictly by the rules of evidence which would apply in a court of
competent jurisdiction. The hearing officer shall have the authority to receive
such evidence as he or she deems relevant and material and to give the evidence
as is received such weight and probative value as, in the hearing officer's
discretion, is deemed proper.

deposit with the Security Bank of Southgate, Michigan. Out of the revenues
remaining in the Receiving Fund after provisions have been made for the
Operation and Maintenance Fund as provided in subsection (a) hereof, there
shall next be set aside an amount proportionately sufficient to provide for the
payment required to be made by the City pursuant to the contract dated March 1,
1962. The amount so set aside, not later than May 1 and September 1 of each
year, shall be not less than the payment required to be made by the City on
such dates pursuant to such contract.
   (c)   Surplus Moneys. Moneys remaining in the Receiving Fund at the end of
any operating year, after satisfying the requirements of subsections (a) and
(b) hereof, may be paid into the Contract Payment Fund and used for the purpose
of paying, in advance, the payments required to be made by the City by the
terms of the agreement dated March 1, 1962, or in the discretion of Council,
may be transferred to a special depository account to be established,
maintained and designated as the Improvement and Extension Fund and used for
improvements, enlargements, extensions or repairs to the System. However, if
there is any deficit in the Contract Payment Fund or in the Operation and
Maintenance Fund on account of defaults in setting aside therein the amounts
required in this section, then transfers shall be made from such funds
remaining in the Receiving Fund at the end of any operating year or from moneys
in the Improvement and Extension Fund to the Contract Payment Fund and
Operation and Maintenance Fund in the priority and order named to the extent of
such deficits.

for the next contract payment, and moneys in any other fund, except the
Receiving Fund and the Operation and Maintenance Fund, may be invested in
obligations of the United States. If such investments are made, the securities
representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the bank having on deposit
the funds from which such purchase was made. Income received from such
investments shall be credited to the fund from which such investments were
made.
(1974 Code Sec. 2.117)
1042.06  FINANCIAL REPORTS.

   A water meter shall be considered accurate if, when tested, it registers not
to exceed five percent more or five percent less than the actual quantity of
water passing through it. If a meter registers in excess of five percent more
than the actual quantity of water passing through it, it shall be considered
fast to that extent. If a meter registers in excess of five percent less than
the actual quantity of water passing through it, it shall be considered slow to
that extent.
(1974 Code § 2.29)
1044.11  ADJUSTMENT OF BILLS.
   If a water meter has been tested at the request of a consumer and has been
determined to register fast, the City shall credit the consumer with a sum
equal to the percent fast multiplied by the amount of all bills incurred by
such consumer within the three months prior to the test. If a meter so tested
is determined to register slow, the Water Department may collect from the
consumer a sum equal to the percent slow multiplied by the amount of all bills
incurred by the consumer for the prior three months. When the Department, on
its own initiative, makes a test of a water meter, it shall be done without
cost to the consumer, other than his or her paying the amount due the City for
water used by him or her as provided in this section if the meter is found to
be slow.
(1974 Code § 2.30)
1044.12  UNAUTHORIZED USE OF FIRE HYDRANTS.

water distribution system unless written approval is provided by the Director
of the Department of Public Service.
   (b)   A hydrant use permit may be issued for commercial use purposes at a
cost determined by resolution of the Southgate Water Board and the Southgate
City Council, which would include a non-refundable user fee and a deposit of
the cost of the hydrant meter. The balance available in the deposit is
refundable following its use, upon inspection of the hydrant meter and water
usage, which fee shall be applied against the deposits. The hydrant use permit
is renewable every 30 days at no additional cost. The applicant must display a
copy of the permit on-site at all times. Permits may be issued only upon
demonstration by the applicant:
      (1)   That an adequate back-flow prevention system has been installed;
      (2)   The use of proper fittings and hoses;
      (3)   A contact name and 24-hour telephone number of the entity
requesting the hydrant permit; and
      (4)   The allocation of appropriate space for an approved Department
employee to inspect hydrant sign and permit.
   (c)   A violation of this section shall constitute a civil infraction
subjecting the violator to a fixed fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus
a water usage charge measured by the maximum tank capacity, as well as other
related expenses associated with rectifying the tampering, including labor and
material expenses incurred by the City.
(1974 Code §2.31; Ord. 760.  Passed 9-11-02; Ord. 19-1003. Passed 6-19-19.) 
1044.13  WATER EMERGENCIES.
   (a)   Application; Right of Entry; Enforcement.
      (1)   Every person, firm or corporation whose premises are supplied with
water by the City shall be subject to the provisions of this section and to all
rules and regulations of the City Administrator pertaining to the use of City
water.
      (2)   It shall be lawful for the City Administrator or his or her
representative to enter upon the premises of any person using City water to
install meters for measuring water and to inspect meters and other fixtures and
appurtenances pertaining to the waterworks system.
      (3)   Officers of the Police Department are hereby authorized to issue
ordinance violation notices, or the Building Department, through its authorized
agents, or the Police Department, may issue civil infraction notices, to any
person violating any provision of this section or any rule or regulation duly
adopted pursuant to this section.
   (b)   Conditions.
      (1)   Conditions warranting the initiation of water use reduction
measures are as follows:
         A.   A prolonged drought or other system-wide heavy demand period that
results in supply facilities, including system pump stations and reservoirs,
being operated at their optimum capacity with no apparent means immediately
available to adequately maintain flows and residual pressures throughout the
system;
         B.   Any emergency condition that may arise which will negatively
affect operating flows and residual pressures in any substantial portion of the
system for any appreciable length of time.
      (2)   The above conditions may warrant a wide range of options, from
alternate day sprinkling in a limited area to no outside water use for any
community served by Detroit water.  In this case, the City of Detroit and/or
the Michigan Department of Public Health would normally take the leadership in
advising of any ultimate responsibility to initiate whatever measures are
needed locally to see that all local emergencies are properly handled.
      (3)   Upon declaration of a water use reduction emergency, the City of

CHARGES.
   The Water Department is hereby authorized to enforce the payment of charges
for water service to any premises by discontinuing the water service to such
premises. The payment of charges for sewage disposal service to any premises
may be enforced by discontinuing either the water service or the sewage
disposal service to such premises, or both, and an action of assumpsit may be
instituted by the City against the customer. The charges for water service and
sewage disposal service which, under M.C.L.A. 141.121, as amended, are made a
lien on the premises to which such services are furnished, are hereby
recognized to constitute such a lien. The Financial Director shall annually, on
April 1, certify all unpaid charges for such services furnished to any premises
which have remained unpaid for two previous billing periods, to the City
Treasurer, who shall place the entire account balance on the next tax roll of
the City. The City Treasurer shall add to that balance a processing fee of 8%
of said balance.  Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same
manner as general City taxes. In cases where the City is properly notified, in
accordance with M.C.L.A. 141.121, that a tenant is responsible for water or
sewage disposal service charges, no such service shall be commenced or
continued to such premises until there has been deposited with the Water
Department a sum sufficient to cover three times the average quarterly bill for
such premises as estimated by the Director. Such deposit shall be, in no case,
less than nine dollars ($9.00). Where the water service to any premises is
turned off to enforce the payment of water service charges or sewage disposal
service charges, the water service shall not be recommenced until all
delinquent charges have been paid and a deposit as in the case of tenants is
made. There shall be a water turn-on charge as determined by City Council
Resolution. In any other case where, in the discretion of the Director, the
collection of charges for water or sewage disposal service may be difficult or
uncertain, the Director may require a similar deposit. Such deposits may be
applied against any delinquent water or sewage disposal service charges, and
the application thereof shall not affect the right of the Water Department to
turn off the water service and/or sewer service to any premises for any
delinquency thereby satisfied. No such deposit shall bear interest and such
deposit, or any remaining balance thereof, shall be returned to the customer
making the same when he or she discontinues receiving water and sewage disposal
service or, except as to tenants as to whom notice of responsibility for such
charges has been filed with the City, when any eight successive quarterly bills
have been paid by such customer with no delinquency.

detention basin and its runoff coefficient (C).
      (2)   Determine the allowable outflow in CFS which shall be either 0.2
CFS per acre or as determined by the agency having jurisdiction of the system
serving as the outlet.
      (3)   Calculate Qo =     Allowable Outflow               
               (A) Acreage x Runoff Coefficient (C)
      (4)   Determine the type of basin outlet that will be used (orifice or
pump).
      (5)   Calculate the maximum storage time (T) from the storage time
equation corresponding to the type of outlet selected in paragraph (b)(4)
hereof (see table below).
      (6)   Calculate the maximum storage per acre impervious (Vs) from the
storage equation corresponding to the type of outlet selected in paragraph (b)
(4) hereof (see table below).
      (7)   Calculate the total volume of storage required for the entire site
(Vt = Vs x C x A).
Type of Basin Outlet   Maximum Storage Time (in minutes)   Maximum Storage
Volume (Ft. 3/Acre Impervious)
Orifice with head   T = - 30 + (11250/Qo)0.5   Vs = 15000T - 400oT
         T + 30
Constant flow pump   T = - 30 + (7500/Qo)0.5   Vs = 15000T - 600oT
          T + 30
   (c)   Except as otherwise permitted and regulated herein, the maximum side
slope of a storm water basin shall not be steeper than a ratio of six to one,
(six feet of horizontal plane for each foot of vertical rise).  When any storm
water retaining basin is to have a side slope steeper than six to one, the
facility shall be subject to the following requirements.
      (1)   A site plan prepared in accordance with the requirements of
subsection (a) hereof, shall be submitted.
      (2)   When required by necessity, the total storage volume of the
facility shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
      (3)   The basin shall be located in an interior side or rear yard, except
where site conditions, such as topography, required direction of site drainage
flow, or other conditions recognized by the City Engineer, require locating the
basin in an exterior side yard or front yard.
      (4)   The side slope of the basin shall be stabilized against erosion and
landslide by means and materials acceptable to the City Engineer.
      (5)   The bottom slope of the basin shall not be less that one percent.
      (6)   The retention basin shall be provided with a ramp that will permit
access to the bottom of the basin by motorized machinery, for maintenance
purposes.
      (7)   The basin shall be completely fenced by a green color matched,
close-like, non- climbable, maximum security-type, chain-link fence. The fence
shall be not less than eight feet in height and shall include a ten-foot wide
swinging or roll away-type of gate. The vertical posts of the fence shall be
anchored in concrete footings that shall be at least forty-two inches deep,
measured from ground level at the post. There shall be provided at the bottom
of the gate a concrete footing to permit a positive securing of a swinging gate
at the closed position or a concrete roll-way for a sliding gate.
      (8)   The fence shall be located on a line parallel to and not less than
one foot from the rim of the basin and shall include signs posted at proper
intervals, but at least on each side of the basin, warning of danger and
prohibiting trespassing. Such signs shall be no greater than two square feet in
size and shall be made of a permanent material, affixed securely to the fence.
      (9)   A landscape planting panel shall be provided on all sides of the
basin. The panel shall be placed outside of and adjacent to the fence. The
panel shall be at least five feet in width, except that where the panel is
adjacent to off-street parking spaces, a minimum width of eight feet shall be
provided. The landscape panel shall be fully planted with a minimum of
evergreen shrubs. Where a screening effect is desired, narrow evergreen trees
shall be used in place of the shrubs. Evergreen trees may also be used in
combination with shrubs when a screening effect is not desired.
         In those instances where ground constraints preclude application of
the five or eight-foot wide landscape panel, a one-foot wide planting panel may
be used in which vines may be planted that will grow up the vertical face of
the fence. Whenever this type of landscape screen is used, a horizontal top
bar, to which the top of the fence shall be attached, shall be employed and
shall be secured to the vertical posts. All plantings used shall be consistent
with the landscape planting standards set forth in Section
1298.09 of the Zoning Code.
         Use of this alternative will require approval by the City Engineer.
The Engineer, in making a determination as to the applicability of this
landscape planting alternative, shall find that the constraints of the site on
which the basin is located clearly preclude use of the wider planting panel.
The City Engineer may request the input of the City Building Department and
other City departments or consultants in making his or her evaluation.
   (d)   When a storm water retention or detention system is to serve as a
visually aesthetic feature of the site, whether it is required by necessity or
not, it shall be made an integral part of the landscaping of the site and shall
be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer.
         The City Engineer, in reviewing the plans, shall find that the
following minimum requirements are met.
      (1)   A site plan drawn to scale and prepared by a licensed engineer
shall be submitted and shall contain all design information applicable to this
type of basin as herein set forth and as set forth in subsection (a) hereof.
      (2)   The maximum side slope of the basin shall not be steeper than a
ratio of six to one (six feet of horizontal plane for each foot of vertical
rise).
      (3)   When required by necessity, the total storage volume of the
facility shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
      (4)   No part of any basin shall be located closer than twenty-five feet
to any structure, right-of-way, parking lot, or lot line.
      (5)   The bottom of the basin shall maintain a slope ratio as set forth
in paragraph (c)(5) hereof, and when designed to serve as a storm water
detention system the bottom shall consist of grass so that when not under
water, it shall serve as part of the site's lawn area.
   (e)   With the exception of unfenced basins designed as an integral part of
a site's landscaped lawn area, storm water entering any fenced basin shall
enter only through sewer inlets. The sides and the rim of these basins shall be
constructed so as to keep storm water runoff from draining directly over the
sides into the basin.
   (f)   All storm water retention systems shall include devices and or systems
designed to effectively circulate water and/or to evaluate water so as not to
create an unsightly, obnoxious, or unhealthy water content. All such systems
shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer.
   (g)   Whether or not a storm water retention or detention system serves as a
visually aesthetic feature of the site, no part of any basin shall be located
closer than twenty-five feet to any structure, right-of-way, parking lot, or
lot line.

1049.01  GRANT OF FRANCHISE FOR UTILITIES.
   Subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in this chapter, and
consistent with the requirements of the Charter of the City, Council may, by
ordinance, grant utilities, and their successors and assigns, franchises to
lay, maintain and operate lines, poles, pipes, wires and conduit and transact
local business in the City, above and under the highways, streets, alleys, and
other public places in the City.  Franchises granted may be revocable and
nonexclusive or exclusive in accordance with the City Charter.  An application
for a franchise shall be made to the Department of Engineering, which shall
investigate the recruits and make recommendations to Council on the ability of
the applicant to use the requested rights-of-way consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the City.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.02  APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   A utility granted a franchise shall operate within the City in accordance
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the United States, the State
of Michigan and the City of Southgate.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The utility, its successors and assigns, shall not unnecessarily
obstruct the passage of any of the highways, streets, alleys or other public
places within the City and shall, within a reasonable time after making an
opening or excavation, repair the same and leave it in as good condition as
before the opening or excavation was made.
   (b)   The utility, its successors and assigns, shall use due care in
exercising the privileges here contained.
   (c)   The utility, its successors and assigns, shall defend and save
harmless the City from any and all claims or lawsuits alleging property damage
or injury arising out of the operation of the franchise or construction work,
including all acts or omissions or negligence of the utility or its officers,
agents, servants or assigns.
      No road, street, alley, highway or public place shall be used for the
laying of lines, poles, pipes, wire, conduit, or mains or other devices, either
below ground or above ground, by a new or existing franchisee, permittee or
licensee, except upon application to the Department of Engineering of the City
or other authority having jurisdiction in the premises, and the payment of any
fees, stating the nature of the proposed work, the method of construction and
the route.  Upon receipt of such application, it shall be the duty of the
Department of Engineering or such other authority as may have jurisdiction to
review the proposed plans to ensure payment of all fees and compliance with the
City Charter and these Codified Ordinances, and to issue a work permit upon
compliance.  Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, but the City
shall regulate the location of such facilities.  Liability for performance of
any work lies solely with the utility notwithstanding the City's review and
approval, including the issuance of work permits and inspection.  Once a work
permit is issued, the Department of Engineering will be notified when any work
is to take place so that employees of the Department of Public Services can be
present.  All pipes, wires, conduit, lines, cable or mains shall be underground
unless the City determines that underground is not reasonable.  The applicant
shall file a bond with the City of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to
guarantee the timely performance and restoration of any construction in the
right-of-way.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.04  STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE; RULES, REGULATIONS AND RATES.
   To the extent the utility is under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Public
Service Commission, the rates to be charged for its product and the standards
and conditions of service and operation hereunder, shall be the same as set
forth in the utility's schedule of rules, regulations, and rates as applicable
in the several cities, villages and townships in which the utility is now
rendering service, or as shall hereafter be validly prescribed for the City
under the orders, rules and regulations of the Michigan Public Service
Commission or other authority having jurisdiction in the premises.  To the
extent the company is not under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Public Service
Commission, the rates to be charged for its services and the standards and
conditions for service and operations hereunder shall be filed with the Clerk
of the City prior to beginning any service.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.05  UTILITY DEFINED.
   The word "utility", wherever used herein, is intended and shall be held and
construed to mean and include both the utility and its successors and assigns,
whether so expressed or not.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.06  JOINT USE OF FACILITIES.
   The utility shall allow joint use (co-use) of its facilities, subject to the
payment of reasonable rental fees, located in the streets, alleys and public
places, by other existing or potential franchisees, permitees or licensees of
the City, insofar as such joint use will not unreasonably interrupt or
interfere with the operation of the utility.  If the parties cannot agree upon
conditions for such use or reasonable rental fees, Council may require an
arbitration to establish the conditions of joint use and the reasonable rental
fee.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.07  FRANCHISE FEES.
   All utilities which are granted franchises or renewals of franchises after
the date of adoption of this chapter shall, as a condition of such franchises,
pay to the City a franchise fee as established from time to time by City
Council by resolution, except that utilities which have facilities in the
rights-of-way of the City on the effective date of this chapter shall not be
charged a franchise fee based on those facilities, other than a renewal fee or
an annual maintenance fee.
(Ord. 702.  Passed 7-19-00.)
1049.08  AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES.
   The utility will make its services available to all citizens of the City,
whether industrial, commercial or residential.  All potential customers who are
in the same category shall be charged at the same rate.  To the extent that the
pooling of potential customers would allow for a more favorable rate, the
utility will allow and facilitate groups which desire to make pooling
arrangements.  The City may require the posting of a surety bond or cash with
the City Treasurer in an amount determined by Council, to assure performance by
the utility of the provisions of this chapter and to defray the costs of the
City in investigating compliance.

(Ord. 530.  Passed 5-19-93.)
1060.04  DUTIES OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS RE COLLECTION AND CONTAINMENT.
   (a)   Single-Family Residential Collection.
      (1)   Collection. All solid waste and recyclable materials from a site of
generation intended for removal from a premises shall be placed in one or more
containers described herein, which shall be placed at the curbside in front of
the premises or, in the case of an adjacent through alley, at the edge thereof.
Such containers shall be placed at the location prior to 6:00 a.m. on the day
scheduled for collection from the premises, but in no case shall any containers
be placed at the curbside or edge of the alley, as the case may be, prior to 4:
00 p.m. of the day preceding the scheduled collection day. The Department of
Public Services shall have the authority to designate the location of the
refuse containers.
      (2)   Containers. Each owner, occupant, tenant or lessee receiving
single-family residential refuse or recyclable collection service shall
provide, for the storage and collection of refuse, at his or her own expense, a
sufficient number of portable containers with tight-fitting lids which are
water-tight and vermin-proof, with handles so that such containers can be
conveniently hoisted and emptied. Such portable containers shall not exceed the
size and weight limitations specified by the Department of Public Services.
Such size and weight limitations shall be posted at City Hall by the City
Clerk. Rubbish that is so large that it cannot be contained in receptacles must
be securely tied in compact bundles not to exceed four feet in length and 50
pounds in weight, and placed in a location convenient for collection.
   (b)   Nonresidential Collection. Reasonable and ordinary quantities of
waste, i.e. garbage, rubbish and recyclable materials, to the extent of 20
bushels per week, from any establishment or business as hereinafter described,
will be collected by an authorized waste hauler. Any person, firm or
corporation who or which operates any office, mercantile, manufacturing, trade
or food establishment, or other place of business, where a quantity of
commercial waste is produced as an incident to the conducting of such
establishment or business, and that produces and accumulates quantities of
garbage and rubbish, shall remove such commercial waste by hiring or
contracting for such removal at his or her or its own expense and in such
manner as not to violate any of the provisions of this chapter or other
ordinances of the City in abating a nuisance, provided, however, that if such
person, firm or corporation fails or neglects to remove such excess commercial
waste, the Department of Public Services may remove or may contract for the
removal of such waste and shall charge the cost thereof to such person, firm or
corporation. In the event payment therefore is not made when billed, the
expense of disposing of such excess waste will be charged to the owner of the
real estate by adding it to the tax rolls, with interest and costs to be
included. Apartment buildings shall constitute commercial activities for the
purposes of collection of waste.
   (c)   Storage. Between collections of solid waste and recyclable materials
by the City or a licensed waste hauler hired by the City or authorized to do
work within the City, each person who is an owner, lessee or occupant of any
site of generation shall store such materials as follows:
      (1)   Solid waste shall be stored in containers constructed of either
rigid plastic or metal, with tightly fitting covers which are rodent-proof, not
less than 20-gallon capacity. Rigid containers must be kept tightly covered,
except when opened for deposit or removal of solid waste. An owner, occupant,
tenant or lessee receiving single-family refuse collection shall be required to
restore the container to an acceptable storage condition not later than 8:00
a.m. the following day after refuse collection takes place.
      (2)   Recyclable materials (other than yard waste) shall be stored in
containers adequate to contain such recyclable materials therein.
      (3)   Every owner, occupant, tenant or lessee using any building, house
or structure for any purpose whatsoever where refuse accumulates, shall provide
and maintain standard refuse containers of sufficient number and size, as
herein specified, in order to store such refuse tending to accumulate on said
premises. Refuse containers that deteriorate or otherwise fail to meet the
requirements of this chapter may be claimed as refuse, and after five days’
written notice to the party or parties responsible or in possession of such
container, such containers shall be collected as refuse by the Department of
Public Services or the City’s authorized refuse collectors.

1060.05  PLACEMENT OF CONTAINERS; TAMPERING; SANITARY CONDITIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in Section
1060.04, containers for the storage of solid waste and recyclable materials
shall be placed at the rear or side of buildings, at a place which is
reasonably inconspicuous from streets and places occupied by other persons.  No
person, firm, corporation or other legal entity shall disturb the contents of
waste receptacles or bundles, nor shall persons leave receptacles or the

1066.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Alarm system" means a device or assembly of equipment and devices
arranged to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to
which police officers are expected to respond. "Alarm system" includes, but is
not limited to, "automatic hold-up alarm system," "burglar alarm system,"
"intrusion alarm system," "(hold-up) alarm system" and "manual hold-up alarm
system."
      Alarm systems employing audible signals (commonly referred to as local
alarms) shall be equipped with shut-off devices that automatically silence the
audible alarm signal after fifteen minutes.
   (b)   "Alarm user" means any person on whose premises an alarm system is
maintained in the City, except for alarm systems on motor vehicles. However, if
an alarm system on a motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a
premises, the person using such system is an alarm user. Also excluded from
this definition and from the coverage of this chapter are persons who use alarm
systems to alert or signal persons within the premises in which the alarm
system is located of an attempted unauthorized intrusion or hold-up attempt.
However, if such a system employs an audible signal emitting sounds or a
flashing light or beacon designed to signal persons outside the premises, such
system shall be within the definition of an alarm system and shall be subject
to this chapter.
   (c)   "False alarm" means any alarm condition, which is registered at the
Police Department or elsewhere, not resulting from criminal activity for which
the alarm was intended.

   At the direction of the Police Chief, an alarm notification form shall be
designed and used as required by this chapter.
(Ord. 368.  Passed 4-20-83.)
1066.03  FALSE ALARMS.
   (a)   An alarm user shall not be required to pay the City for the first
false alarm answered by the City.  However, the City will charge one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for each additional false alarm received by the Police
Department or the Fire Department in any calendar year.  After the first false
alarm, the owner or occupant of the premises shall be advised in writing of the
penalty for any subsequent false alarm in the same calendar year; however,
notification is not a requirement to enforce the fees in this chapter.  Payment
shall be made through the Police Department.  If payment is not made within
thirty days, the fee will be added to the tax rolls and an administrative fee
of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be added to cover the costs of processing
such delinquent payment.
   (b)   Alarm conditions caused by the following extenuating circumstances
shall not constitute a false alarm:
      (1)   Alarm system malfunctions, if corrective measures have been
instituted within seventy-two hours of notification by a City department,
provided that the alarm user presents documentation of repair service having
been performed by the alarm company to remedy a malfunction to the Police
Department;
      (2)   Storm conditions;
      (3)   Alarm conditions being activated by persons working on the alarm
system with prior notification to the Department; and
      (4)   Alarms activated by disruption or disturbance of telephone or other
communication systems.
   In paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (4) hereof, the alarm user shall notify the
Police Department by filling out an alarm notification form and returning it to
the Department within ten days of receipt of the alarm notification form.
Failure to notify the Department will result in an automatic billing to the
user.
   (c)   Upon the response of a police officer to an alarm call, a
representative of the Department shall mail an alarm notification form to the
alarm user.
   (d)   Within ten days of the date of the alarm notification form, the alarm
user shall return the completed form to the Department. Failure by the alarm
user to return the form shall cause an automatic billing of the false alarm fee
to be sent to the alarm user as set forth in this chapter.
   (e)   If, upon receiving a false alarm fee notice, the alarm user wishes to
request a waiver of the assessment of the fee due to extenuating circumstances,
he or she may do so, in writing, within ten days of the assessment date. The
notice to the Department shall contain documentation of the extenuating
circumstances involved.
      Within ten days of the receipt of the waiver request by the Department,
the Police Chief or his or her designee shall make a determination on the
waiver request and shall notify the alarm user of the decision in writing.
(Ord. 633.  Passed 4-30-97.)
1066.04  USE OF TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.
   (a)   The purpose of this section is to prevent the disruption of and
interference with telephone communication systems by allowing alarm systems
which, when activated, connect with the communications facility of the Police
Department by means of the Department's telephone system.
   (b)   No person engaged in the business of providing such services and
facilities shall use or operate, attempt to use or operate or cause to be used
or operated, or arrange, adjust, program or otherwise provide or install, any
device or combination of devices that will, upon activation, either
mechanically, electronically or by other automatic means, initiate the
intrastate calling, dialing or connection to any telephone number assigned to
any subscriber by a public telephone company, without proper written consent of
such subscriber.
   (c)   "Telephone number" includes any additional numbers assigned by a
public utility company engaged in the business of providing communications
services and facilities to be used by means of a rotary number when the primary
telephone number is in use.

PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION.
   No subdivision plat required by these Subdivision Regulations or the
Subdivision Control Act shall be admitted to the public land records of the
County, or received or recorded by the County Register of Deeds, until such
subdivision plat has received final approval by Council. No public board,
agency, commission, official or other authority shall proceed with the
construction of or authorize the construction of any of the public improvements
required by these Subdivision Regulations, unless such public improvement has
already been accepted or opened, or has otherwise received the legal status of
a public improvement prior to the adoption of these Subdivision Regulations
(Ordinance 260, passed December 7, 1977), unless such public improvement
corresponds in its location and to other requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1242.02  FEES.

Subdivision Regulations were adopted.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1242.04  VARIANCES.
   (a)   Generally. The Planning Commission may recommend to Council a variance
from any of the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations on a finding that
undue hardship may result from strict compliance with any such provision or
that application of such provision is impractical. The Commission shall only
recommend variances that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public
interest. In making its findings, the Commission shall take into account the
nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the
vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision
and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in
the vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the Commission finds,
after a public hearing, that:
      (1)   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting such
property that make the strict application of these Subdivision Regulations
clearly impractical or unreasonable. In such cases, the subdivider shall first
state his or her reasons, in writing, as to the specific provision or
requirement involved, and submit such reasons to the Commission.
      (2)   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which such
property is situated.
      (3)   Such variance will not violate any of the provisions of the
Subdivision Control Act.
      (4)   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of these Subdivision Regulations and the Comprehensive Development
Plan of the City.
   The Commission shall include its findings and the specific reasons therefor
in its report of recommendations to Council, and shall also record its reasons
and actions in its minutes.
   (b)   Topographical; Physical Limitation Variance. Where, in the case of a
particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that strict compliance with
these Subdivision Regulations would result in extraordinary hardship to the
subdivider because of unusual topography, other physical conditions or other
such conditions which are not self-inflicted, or that these conditions would
result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of these Subdivision
Regulations, the Commission may recommend to Council that a variance,
modification or waiver of these Subdivision Regulations be granted.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1242.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations, whether as owner or agent of the owner of property,
shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and the cost of
prosecution, or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both, at the
discretion of the court, for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues. Furthermore, all persons shall be subject to the penalties set forth
in Section 264 of the Subdivision Control Act. A landowner, tenant, subdivider,
builder, public official or other person who commits, participates in, assists
in or maintains such violation or noncompliance may each be found guilty of a
separate offense and suffer the penalties provided in this section. Nothing
contained in this section shall prevent Council or any other public official or
private resident from taking such lawful action as is necessary to restrain or
prevent any violation of or noncompliance with any of the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations or of the Subdivision Control Act.

(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1246.02  STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (a)   Generally. The specifications set forth in this section are hereby
declared to be the standards and general plan adopted by Council for the width
and location of all highways, streets and alleys which may hereafter be platted
or accepted in the City. However, roads under the jurisdiction of the County
Road Department shall conform to the road and right-of-way standards and
policies of the Department, and roads under the jurisdiction of the City shall
conform to the standards set forth in the Street and Traffic Plan of the
Comprehensive Development Plan.
   (b)   Layout. The layout of proposed streets shall provide for the
continuation of existing streets in surrounding areas and/or shall conform to a
plan for the neighborhood approved by the Planning Commission in cases where
topographical or other conditions preclude the continuation of existing
streets. In general, such streets shall be of a width as great as that of the
street so extended. Due consideration shall be given to traffic safety. Minor
residential streets shall be laid out so as to discourage their use by through
traffic. Due consideration shall also be given by the subdivider to the
attractiveness of the street layout in order to obtain the maximum livability
and amenity of the subdivision. Consideration shall also be given to the
proposed use of the subdivision, and proper allowance shall be made in
industrial subdivisions for potential and existing railroad rights of way as
conditions will permit. Any intersection occurring on a street which crosses a
railroad track shall be not less than 400 feet from the nearest railroad right
of way. Greater distances may be required if it is deemed necessary for safety,
approach gradients or future grade separations.
   (c)   Major Thoroughfares. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing
or proposed major thoroughfare, the Planning Commission may, at its discretion,
require the construction of marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with
provision for screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along rear
property lines with a minimum width of fifteen feet or with side lot lines
parallel to major thoroughfares, deep lots with rear service alleys or other
treatment which the Commission considers essential for adequate protection of
residential lots and for separation of through and local traffic.
   (d)   Private Streets and Alleys. Private streets and alleys shall not be
permitted. All streets and alleys shall be dedicated to the public.
   (e)   Dedication of Half-Streets. The dedication of half-streets will not be
permitted where a subdivision adjoins undeveloped property, except where one-
half of major streets are sixty feet or greater in width as appearing on the
Comprehensive Development Plan. Wherever there already exists a dedicated and
recorded half-street or half-alley on an adjoining plat, the other half must be
dedicated on the proposed plat to make the street or alley complete.
   (f)   Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of not less than 125
feet should be avoided.
   (g)   Cul-de-Sacs. Where required for the full and best utilization of the
property, cul-de-sacs may be utilized. The maximum permissible length of a cul-
de-sac shall be 500 feet measured from the right-of-way line of the nearest
intersecting street to the farthest point on the right-of-way line of the cul-
de-sac. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided at its closed end with a turnaround
having a diameter at the outside of the roadway pavement of at least eighty
feet and a property line diameter of at least 120 feet for residential streets
and 150 feet for industrial streets. The remaining portion of the cul-de-sac
shall have a right-of-way width of at least sixty feet. The straight portion of
the right of way shall be joined to the circular portion of the right of way by
circular curves with radii of not less than fifty feet.
   (h)   Dead-End Streets. Dead-end streets shall be defined as streets which
will not or cannot be extended through to another street in the future.
Normally, such streets shall be deemed permanent dead-end streets and will not
be approved if they exceed 400 feet in length as measured from the right-of-way
line of the nearest cross street to the center of the cul-de-sac. Every
permanent dead-end street shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having an outside roadway diameter of at least seventy feet and a street
property line diameter of at least ninety-nine feet. However, under specific
existing conditions, where topographic conditions indicate that a hardship
would be caused if this requirement were strictly enforced, and where an
exception to this regulation might serve the best interests of the City, an
extension of a dead-end street, to a total length of not more than 600 feet,
may be granted.
   (i)   Alleys. Continuous alleys having a minimum width of twenty feet will
be required in the rear of all local business and commercial lots, except that
this requirement may be waived by the City Engineer where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the use proposed.
      A diagonal cut-off shall be made at all acute and right-angle
intersections of alleys sufficient to provide an inside turning radius of
thirty feet.
      Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas unless they are deemed
necessary because of topography or other exceptional circumstances.
   (j)   Street Names. Street names which might cause confusion with names of
existing streets in or near the City shall not be permitted. Streets that will
be continuations of existing streets shall be called by the same names of such
existing streets. All names shall be approved by the Planning Commission, with
final approval by Council.
   (k)   Building Lines and Set-Back Lines. Building lines shall conform to the
Zoning Code.
   (l)   Right-of-Way Width. The minimum right-of-way width shall be sixty
feet. Greater right-of-way widths for major thoroughfares and collector streets
may be required by the Planning Commission or the County Road Department.
   (m)   Horizontal Alignment. Centerlines of pavement shall coincide with
centerlines of rights of way, except for irregular right-of-way widths.
   (n)   Street Grades. Profiles shall be required on all streets. The minimum
gradient allowed shall be 0.4 percent and the maximum gradient allowed shall be
6.0 percent. Variances must be approved by the City Engineer, with the purpose
for the variance clearly indicated.
   (o)   Street Curvature. The minimum horizontal centerline radii of curved
local streets shall be 200 feet. Greater radii may be required for principal
streets having through traffic. A minimum fifty-foot tangent shall be
introduced between reverse curves on streets of a sixty-foot right of way.
Greater tangents shall be required on streets of a greater right of way.
Modifications of these requirements may be made by the City Engineer, where
compliance with them may serve no good purpose.
   (p)   Street Alignment. When street lines deflect from each other by more
than ten degrees in alignment, the centerlines shall be connected by a curve
with a minimum radius of 500 feet for major arterial streets, 300 feet for
collector streets and 150 feet for local or minor streets. Between reverse
curves, on minor streets, there shall be a minimum tangent distance of 100
feet, and on collector and arterial streets, 200 feet.
   (q)   Street Intersections.
      (1)   The intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided. Exceptions to this requirement shall be considered individually by the
Planning Commission and shall be authorized only where there is no alternative.
      (2)   Streets shall intersect at ninety degree angles or closely thereto,
and in no case at less than eighty degree angles.
      (3)   Except on arterials and certain collectors, "T" type intersections
shall be used where practical.
      (4)   No street intersection shall be located closer than 200 feet to
another intersection.
      (5)   Intersections shall be provided with a minimum slope to facilitate
drainage. This minimum slope shall be carried back 150 feet each way from the
intersection, measured from the centerline of the intersected street. An
allowance of three percent maximum intersection grade will be permitted.
      (6)   There shall be a clear vision zone at all corners of intersecting
roads or road junctions, consisting of a triangular area defined by the point
of intersection of the right-of-way lines and the line drawn between two points
extended along such right-of-way lines a distance of twenty-five feet from the
point of intersection. Within such area, no obstruction to vision, excluding
existing topography, shall be permitted from a height of two feet to eight feet
above the centerline elevation of abutting streets, except that not more than
one tree with a trunk of not more than thirty inches in diameter and clear of
any branches for such heights may be located within such area. This paragraph
shall not prohibit the requirement of a greater clear vision zone where such is
necessary in view of permitted traffic turning movements, existing and
anticipated traffic volumes, traffic speeds, intersection configurations,
geographic and topographic conditions or other unique characteristics which may
require a greater clear vision zone.
   (r)   Surface Drainage. The preferred plan for yard drainage shall provide
for drainage from the rear of a lot to the front of a lot with a minimum grade
of one percent and a maximum grade of three percent (FHA Type A).
      If it is found to be essential to the economic development of substantial
portions of a project, an easement at the rear of the lot may be below the
building grade. In this event, the grade shall be not less than one percent nor
more than three percent and the grade from the house to the street shall be not
less than one percent with the building grade being not less than twelve inches
above the street grade. Grades in excess of three percent shall be subject to
the approval of the City Engineer, after recommendation from the Planning
Commission.
      Where a low easement is essential to the economical development of major
portions of the project, the longitudinal grade of such easement shall be not
less than 0.4 of one percent and the length of run of such longitudinal
easement shall not exceed 500 feet of continuance drainage, with not more than
100 feet of such drainage being upstream from an angle point in the easement.
      Where required by the City Engineer, a four-inch drainage tile shall be
provided for easement drainage, with such tile laid in a trench backfilled with
pea gravel or approved bankrun gravel. The depth of the grade and outlet for
such tile is subject to City approval.
   (s)   Access to Streets Across Ditches. Subdividers shall provide access to
all proposed streets across watercourses or ditches in a standard manner as
approved by the City Engineer.
   (t)   Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes. Acceleration, deceleration and
passing lanes shall be provided at the intersections of a minor street with a
major thoroughfare, as required by the highway authority having jurisdiction.
   (u)   Local or Minor Streets. Such streets shall be so arranged as to
discourage their use by through traffic.
   (v)   Relation to Topography. Streets shall be arranged in proper relation
to topography so as to result in usable lots, safe streets and reasonable
gradients.
   (w)   Marginal Access Streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains a major
thoroughfare, the City may require:
      (1)   Marginal access streets approximately parallel to and on each side
of the right of way; or
      (2)   Such other treatment as it deems necessary for the adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
   (x)   Corner Radii. Curb corners shall be rounded or cut back to provide for
a curb radius of not less than twenty feet. Special cases due to existing
conditions will be considered individually on the basis of safety and overall
design.
   (y)   Streets in Relation to Railroads. Whenever a subdivision adjoins or
includes a railroad right of way, a street shall be placed parallel to the
railroad to intercept streets tending to otherwise cross the tracks. Any
intersection occurring on a street which crosses the railroad track shall not
be less than 400 feet from the nearest railroad right of way. Greater distances
may be required if deemed necessary for safety, approach gradients or future
grade separations.
   (z)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of the street.
Sidewalks shall be sized and surfaced in accordance with
Chapter 1248.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1246.03  PEDESTRIANWAYS.
   (a)   Crosswalks. A right of way for pedestrian crosswalks in the middle of
blocks exceeding 1,000 feet in length may be required where necessary to obtain
convenient pedestrian circulation to schools, parks or shopping areas. The
right of way shall be at least ten feet wide and extend entirely through the
block.
   (b)   Surfacing. The entire walkway surface shall be constructed to meet
City concrete sidewalk specifications. A four-foot high chain link fence shall
be erected along right-of-way lines.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1246.04  UTILITY AND DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   In the case of a new subdivision development or redevelopment where overhead
utility lines currently exist, the proprietor of the development shall place
all existing utilities underground. If the proprietor is unable to place the
existing utilities underground because of specific requirements or conditions
of the utility company, the specific reasons with documentation from the
utility company, must be made in writing to the Planning Commission at the time
of plat approval for review. The Planning Commission will take this information
into consideration when making its recommendation regarding the development to
City Council.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77; Ord. 307.  Passed 9-26-79; Ord. 830.  Passed 8-23-
06.)
1246.05  LOTS.
   (a)   Generally. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated. Residential lots shall be of such size as to permit a
variety of house types, to provide side yards for desirable access, light, air,
privacy and safety from fire hazards, to provide for setbacks from the street
line and to allow sufficient space for household purposes.
   (b)   Access. All lots shall have full frontage on a properly dedicated
street. Lots, other than corner lots, shall not be permitted to front onto two
streets.
   (c)   Size of Lots. Residential lots shall have minimum widths, depths and
areas, in square feet, in conformity with the Zoning Code. Lots fronting on
cul-de-sacs or other types of curved rights of way shall have a minimum
frontage at the right-of-way lines, measured along the curve, of thirty-five
feet, provided that the width of the lot measured in a straight line parallel
to the building line and distant twenty-five feet from the nearest point of the
right of way in front of the lot shall be not less than the minimum frontage
required for residential lots established in the Zoning Code.
   When a parcel of land is subdivided into lots, whether such lots are the
minimum sizes mentioned in this subsection or larger, no lot shall be greater
in depth than four times the frontage width.
   (d)   Large Lots. If a tract is subdivided into parcels containing one or
more acres, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the resubdivision of any
parcels into normal lots in accordance with these Subdivision Regulations.
   (e)   Lots with Double Frontage. Lots with double frontage shall be avoided,
other than corner lots. If provided, these lots shall have sufficient depth so
that a reasonable front yard may be provided on both street frontages to
protect similar frontages on adjacent lots in each direction.
   (f)   Corner Lots. Corner lots shall be provided with an extra fifteen feet
of width sufficient to permit the maintenance of building set-back lines on
both the front and side street lines in order to protect similar existing or
planned setbacks on both the front and side streets.
   (g)   Side Lot Lines. Side property lines of lots shall generally be
perpendicular to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless
a variation from this subsection will give a better lot plan. Property lines on
sides and rears of lots should be straight.
   (h)   Building and Set-Back Lines. Building and set-back lines shall conform
to the Zoning Code.
   (i)   Industrial or Commercial Lots. No lot or parcel zones as industrial or
commercial shall be platted that is less than fifty feet in width. The area of
such lot or parcel shall be sufficient in size to provide sufficient area for
off-street parking and loading in accordance with the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
   (j)   Lot Division or Split.
      (1)   Generally.  No lot or parcel contained in a recorded plat, nor any
unplatted lot or parcel, shall be divided into more than four parts.  Lots
resulting from any such division shall each comply with and conform to at least
the minimum area permitted by this Zoning Code, and the other provisions of
this section.  No building permit shall be issued, nor any building
construction commenced, until the land for building sites has been approved by
the County Health Department, where applicable.  The division of a lot in a
recorded plat is prohibited, unless it is approved following application to
Council.  The division of an unplatted lot, outlot or parcel of land is
prohibited, unless approved by the Building Director in accordance, to the
extent possible, with the provisions of subsections (a) through (m) hereof, the
Zoning Code, and the City's plan for future development.
      (2)   Submittal of lot split/lot combination and fees. Any person
desiring a lot split shall submit to the City Assessor a written application
thereof, a recorded Deed proving ownership, (if a land contract is involved, we
must have written approval from both parties), additionally, three copies of a
survey, prepared by a registered engineer or land surveyor, which shows the
proposed divisions, depicts the location of any existing buildings, fences, and
structures, and includes a proper legal description of each separate lot or
parcel proposed and of the lot or parcel to be divided. For a lot combination,
the property owner shall submit to the City Assessor a written application
therefore, a recorded Deed proving ownership, (if a land contract is involved,
we must have written approval from both parties), an accurate and complete
description of the parcels to be combined must also be provided. Fees for both
splits and combinations shall be set by resolution of the City Council.
      (3)   Duties of City Assessor.  The City Assessor shall review the
proposed lot split to determine its compliance with these Subdivision
Regulations and with the Subdivision Control Act, and shall submit the proposed
lot split for the appropriate approval.
      (4)   Taxes.  No lot or parcel of land shall be split or combined until
all taxes and special assessments have been paid.  A receipt for payment of the
same shall be submitted with the proposed lot split/combination application.
(Ord. 477.  Passed 5-9-90; Ord. 18-998.  Passed 5-2-18.)
   (k)   Back-Up Lots. Lots shall back into such features as freeways, arterial
streets, shopping centers or industrial properties, except where there is a
marginal access street, unless a secondary access is provided. Consideration
shall be given to providing additional lot depth for buffering purposes. Lots
extending through a block and having frontage on two local streets shall be
prohibited.
   (l)   Uninhabitable Areas. Lands subject to flooding or otherwise deemed by
the Planning Commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential purposes or for uses that may, in the judgment of the Commission,
increase the danger to health, life or property, or increase the flood hazard.
Such land within a subdivision shall be set aside for other uses, such as parks
or other open space.
   (m)   Future Arrangements. Where parcels of land are subdivided into
unusually large lots (such as when large lots are required for septic tank
operations), the parcels shall be arranged, where feasible, so as to allow for
resubdividing into smaller parcels in a logical fashion.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77; Ord. 878.  Passed 1-21-09.)
1246.06  BLOCKS.
   (a)   Generally. The size and shape of blocks shall be appropriate for the
type of lots and land use proposed. Blocks shall be designed so as to permit
good lot orientation, safe street design and economical use of the land.
   (b)   Length. The length of blocks between intersecting streets shall be not
less than 660 feet nor more than 1,320 feet. However, where unusual conditions
exist, variations in these restrictions may be allowed where such variations
will serve the best interest of the City.
   (c)   Width. A block shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots
and shall be not less than 240 feet in width, except where lots back into a
major thoroughfare, natural feature or subdivision boundary.
   (d)   Nonresidential Blocks. Blocks intended for purposes other than
residential shall be especially designed for such purposes and shall have
adequate provision for off-street parking and loading in accordance with the
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 260.  Passed 12-7-77.)
1246.07  USE RESTRICTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Restrictions. Wherever property is proposed for subdividing with the
intention that it shall have a use different than that designated in the Zoning
Code, such use shall be stated in an application for an amendment to the Zoning
Code or in a separate statement filed with the Planning Commission. Conformity
with the objectives of the Comprehensive Development Plan shall be required so
as to ensure general uniformity of land uses within blocks and neighborhoods.
   (b)   Conformity with Zoning Code. Property use and area restrictions shall
be in accordance with the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Business or Commercial Lots. Business or commercial lots, when
platted, shall bear a reasonable relation in number to the probable number of
families constituting the purchasing power of the surrounding tributary area.
The Commission shall recommend the location of business and commercial lots in
accordance with the Comprehensive Development Plan and the Zoning Code.
   (d)   Commercial or Industrial Modifications. These subdivision design
standards may be modified in accordance with Section
1242.04 in the case of a subdivision specifically for commercial or industrial
development, including shopping districts, wholesaling areas and planned
industrial districts. However, in all cases, adequate provisions shall be made
for off-street parking and loading areas, as well as for traffic circulation.
   (e)   Flood Hazard Areas. Areas within a proposed plat which are subject to
flooding or inundation by storm water, which are within the floodplain of a
river, stream, creek or lake or which have inadequate drainage shall not be
platted for any use that could increase danger to life, health or property. If
Council determines that a flood problem exists, then it shall reject all or
part of the proposed plat lying within the floodplain or area subject to
flooding. Areas of land lying within a floodplain shall require compliance with
the Subdivision Control Act and review by the State Department of Natural
Resources. The proprietor may show, by engineering site plans, that a change in
the topography will eliminate flooding and shall demonstrate that any planned
topographical change will not aggravate the flood hazard beyond the limits of
the plat.
   (f)   Public Sites and Open Spaces.
      (1)   In the design of the plat, thorough and equitable consideration
shall be given by the subdivider and the City to the dedication or reservation
of suitable sites of adequate area for future schools, parks, playgrounds and
other public purposes. The location of these facilities should conform as
nearly as possible to the Comprehensive Development Plan. Such open spaces
shall not be unreasonable in area in relation to the land being subdivided and
to the prospective uses of such land. The Planning Commission may recommend the
reservation of such areas within subdivisions.
      (2)   Upon a determination by a public agency that space for a public
facility is required, the agency involved shall, within ninety days, enter into
an agreement to purchase the site. Acquisition of the site shall be
accomplished within three (3) The reservation of other public open spaces may
be required where deemed necessary by the Commission for preservation of
historic sites and scenic areas, or for a particular type of development
proposed in the subdivision but not anticipated in the Comprehensive
Development Plan.
      (4)   The dedication of planting strips or buffer parks may be required
by the Commission in areas where it deems it desirable to separate and protect
residential subdivisions from adjacent commercial developments, highways,
streets, railroads or obnoxious uses. Such strips shall be a minimum of twenty
feet in width and shall not be a part of a normal roadway right of way or
utility easement.
   (g)   Reserve Strips.
      (1)   Private reserve strips. Privately held reserve strips controlling
access to streets shall be prohibited.
      (2)   Public reserve strips. A one-foot reserve strip may be required to
be placed at the end of dead-end streets which terminate at subdivision
boundaries and between half-streets. These reserves shall be deeded in fee
simple to the City for future street purposes.
   (h)   Protection of Natural Features. Due regard shall be shown for all
natural features, such as large trees, exceptionally fine groves of trees,
watercourses, scenic points, historic spots and similar community assets, which
features, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision.

1264.04  POWERS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to vary or modify any
ordinance provision whenever there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships imposed on the property owner if the strict letter of the ordinance
is carried out. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall decide appeals in such a
manner that the spirit of the ordinance is observed, public safety secured, and
substantial justice done.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89; Ord. 841.  Passed 2-7-07.)
1264.05  APPEALS.
   An appeal may be taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals by any person wishing
to appeal any ordinance provision or any final decision of the Director of
Inspections or the Planning Commission. All appeals must be applied for in
writing on forms provided by the City. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall give
notice of the hearing to the parties involved. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall also give notice to owners and occupants of property within a minimum of
300 feet from the property lines of the property, which is the subject of the
appeal. Notice shall be by regular mail or personal delivery and shall be sent
to the property owners as shown on the latest tax assessment roll. Notice shall
be given at least fifteen days prior to the hearing in accordance with Public
Act 110 of 2006, as may be amended. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear the
following:
   (a)   Administrative Review.  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
by the appellant that there is an error in any order, requirement, permit,
decision or refusal made by the Director of Inspections or other administrative
official in carrying out or enforcing this Zoning Code;
   (b)   Variances.  To authorize, upon an appeal, a variance from the strict
application of the provisions of this Zoning Code where, by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of a specific piece of
property at the time of enactment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 458, passed
January 4, 1989), or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional conditions of such property, the strict
application of this Zoning Code would result in peculiar or exceptional
practical difficulties to, or exceptional undue hardship upon, the owner of
such property, provided such relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Exceptions and Special Approvals. To hear and decide, in accordance
with this Zoning Code, requests for exceptions, for interpretations of the
Zoning Map and for decisions on special approval situations on which this
Zoning Code specifically authorizes the Board to pass. Any exception shall be
subject to such conditions as the Board may require to preserve and promote the
character of the district in question and to otherwise promote the purposes of
this Zoning Code.

additional information as is necessary to make a decision. In making a
decision, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions as it may deem
necessary to comply with the spirit and purpose of the Zoning Code. No variance
may be granted or decision overruled unless a majority of the voting members
vote in favor thereof. Any variance shall expire one year from the date it is
granted unless use of the property has begun or construction has been
undertaken pursuant to the variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall state
the grounds of each decision, which shall be based on the following:
   (a)   That compliance with the ordinance results in a practical difficulty.
   (b)   That the problem requiring the variance is unique to the applicant's
property and is not shared by properties in the same zoning district.
   (c)   That the problem is not self-inflicted.
   (d)   That the variance is the minimum necessary to permit reasonable use if
the property.
   (e)   That the variance, if granted, would not compromise the public health,
safety, and welfare.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89; Ord. 841.  Passed 2-7-07.)
1264.07  CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   Any conditions of approval imposed by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall meet
the following requirements:
   (a)   Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and
welfare and the social and economic well being of those who will use the land
use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately
adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole.
   (b)   Be related to the valid exercise of the police power, and purposes
which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
   (c)   Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the Zoning Code, be
related to the standards established in the ordinance for the land use or
activity under consideration, and be necessary to insure compliance with those
standards.

1264.08  POWER TO REVIEW; ADULT BUSINESSES.
   The power of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall not be modified in any
fashion by Section
1298.06(f). However, the Board's power to review and take additional action
with respect to adult businesses, as defined in Section
1260.07, shall be subject to the following:
   (a)   Effect of Denial.  No appeal to the Board which has been denied wholly
or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the effective
date of said order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
a change of conditions found to be valid by the Board. Applications for a
rehearing shall be in writing and subject to the same rules as an original
hearing.
   (b)   Revocation of Grant.  If the conditions prescribed by the Board in
making any grant or approving any application are not complied with within six
months from the effective date of said grant or approval, then, without further
action by the Board, the grant shall be null and void. Extensions of time for
compliance may be granted by the Board upon application of the appellee for
good cause shown.
   (c)   Costs. Upon the payment of costs, a copy of the record of any matter
on appeal shall be made available to the parties. The official record of an
appeal shall be open for examination as a public record.

Appeals may be appealed to the Circuit Court as specified in the Zoning
Enabling Act of Michigan, Act 110 of 2006, as amended. The Circuit Court may
order the Board of Zoning Appeals to rehear a case in the event that the Court
finds that the record of the Board of Zoning Appeals is inadequate to make the
proper review, or that there is additional evidence that is material and with
good reason was not presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 579.  Passed 8-9-95; Ord. 841.  Passed 2-7-07.)
1264.09  RE-APPLICATION TIME PERIODS.
   No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part by the

by the Board of Zoning Appeals to be valid.  Resubmission shall require all
appropriate fees and application as any other BZA request.

      (1)   Buildings of greater than the maximum height allowed in Section
1298.01 may be allowed, provided front, side and rear yards are increased above
the minimum required yards by one foot for each foot of building height that
exceeds the maximum height allowed.

      (3)   All access to the site shall be in accordance with Section
1298.16.
      (4)   All off-street parking shall be screened as set forth and regulated
in Section
1298.13.
   (b)   Public, parochial and other private intermediate or secondary schools
offering courses in general education, not operated for profit, and not
including dormitories;
   (c)   Utility and public service buildings and uses (without storage yards)
when operating requirements necessitate the location of such a building within
such Districts in order to serve the immediate vicinity and when the
architecture is in keeping with the surrounding area;
   (d)   Nursery schools, day nurseries and child care centers (not including
dormitories), provided that:
      (1)   The facility meets the requirements established in the Licensing
Rules for Child Care Centers manual, as established by the Department of Human
Services with the State of Michigan for indoor space;
      (2)   For each child there shall be provided and maintained a minimum of

recreation centers, and nonprofit swimming pool clubs, not including indoor ice

conditions:
      (1)   The proposed site for any of the uses permitted herein which would
attract persons from, or are intended to serve, areas beyond the immediate
neighborhood, shall have at least one property line abutting a major
thoroughfare and the site shall be so planned as to provide all access in
accordance with Section
1298.16.
      (2)   Front, side and rear yards shall be at least eighty feet wide and
shall be landscaped in trees, shrubs and grass. All such landscaping shall be

than one-half of the member families and/or individual members. The Planning
Commission may modify the off-street parking requirements in instances wherein
it is specifically determined that the users will originate from the

buildings and structures, shall be so located and related as to minimize the
possibilities of adverse effects upon adjacent property. This shall mean that
all principal or accessory buildings shall be not less than 200 feet from any
property line abutting residentially zoned lands, provided that where
topographic conditions are such or will be such that buildings will be screened
from view, the Planning Commission may modify this requirement.
      (4)   Whenever a swimming pool is to be provided, such pool and the pool
area shall comply with the conditions set forth in subsection (e) hereof.

      (1)   Not more than 51% of the land in the residential unit, as
graphically outlined in the City's Comprehensive Development Plan, in which the
cemetery is to be located, is in recorded plats.
      (2)   All access to the site shall be in accordance with Section

1281.01   INTENT.
   (a)   The Zoning Ordinance regulates the intensity and use of development,
which is appropriate in most parts of the City. There are also areas within the
City in which greater emphasis on regulating form and character of development
should be considered as well as use and intensity of use. The Market Center
Overlay District (MCOD) uses specific design and review provisions to
accomplish this, with a special sensitivity to the contextual relevance of a
unique commercial area along the Eureka Road Corridor. This unique zoning
overlay district allows the City to regulate land use in a more flexible format
for this specific area to encourage a viable, dynamic mix of uses.
   (b)   Proposed Area.  Beginning at the southeast corner of Fordline Street
and Eureka Road, thence along the southern half of Eureka Road easterly to the
southwest corner of Howard Street and Eureka Road, thence southerly along
Howard Street approximately 256 feet, thence westerly approximately 167 feet,
thence southerly approximately 1,045 feet, thence westerly approximately 214
feet, thence southerly approximately 530 feet, thence westerly approximately
538 feet, thence northerly approximately 357 feet, thence westerly
approximately 1,309 feet, thence southerly 565 feet along Trenton Road, thence
westerly approximately 423 feet, thence northerly approximately 1,393 feet,
thence westerly approximately 1,223 feet to Fordline Street, thence northerly
along Fordline Street approximately 517 feet to Eureka connecting with the
point of beginning and creating the overlay district boundaries.
   (c)   The preferred form of development includes those projects that advance
the following objectives:
      (1)   Improved building appearance;
      (2)   Use of durable building materials, such as brick masonry;
      (3)   Increased pedestrian accommodations and facilities;
      (4)   Less required parking;
      (5)   Safe and efficient vehicle circulation;
      (6)   Appropriate transitions to existing and any future multiple and
single family residential uses;
      (7)   Uniform signage of compatible size and materials;
      (8)   Locating of buildings nearer to the street;
      (9)   Multiple story buildings;
      (10)   Varied and interesting architectural styles and features;
      (11)   Increased building transparency on the first floors;
      (12)   Mixed uses.
(Ord. 19-1009.  Passed 12-18-19.)
1281.02   APPLICABILITY AND ORGANIZATION.
   (a)   Any new use or expansion of an existing use, unless otherwise noted
herein, shall comply with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable

special provisions for parking and landscape and streetscape elements.
      (2)   Permitted and special use table that provides for a dynamic mix of
uses throughout the district.
      (3)   Design standards applicable to all MCOD properties.
      (4)   Design-based dimensional requirements. These include special
provisions not found in other zoning districts, including:
         A.   Minimum and maximum height;
         B.   Required building lines and setback lines;
         C.   Exemptions  and  modifications from  design-based  provisions for
streetscape elements;
         D.   Parking location; and
         E.   Lot coverage and open space.
(Ord. 19-1009.  Passed 12-18-19.)
1281.03   REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE MCOD.
   (a)   Parking. Parking when provided shall be in accordance with
Chapter 1292 . However, the City may reduce the amount of parking required and
may modify all related regulations required by
Chapter 1292  provided that the proposed project advances the currently adopted
design considerations and provides benefits that could not be achieved
utilizing the regulations in the underlying zoning.
   (b)   Landscape and Streetscape. Landscape and streetscape elements shall be
required in accordance with Section
1298.09  and the following. Whenever provisions of Section
1298.09  may conflict with these provision, the below provisions prevail:
      (1)   Street furniture shall be provided at a ratio of one (1) element
for every thirty (30) linear feet of frontage along a right-of-way. Street
furniture may be located in a city right-of-way or on private property,
provided it is located between the front building line and the back-of-curb. A
five (5)-foot width of walkable area between the building and curb must be
maintained. Permitted street furniture features include:
         A.   A permanently mounted seating or table fixture.
         B.   A permanently reserved planting bed with defined, durable edges.
Such beds must be a minimum of twenty (20) square feet in area and should be
raised or protected from the surrounding paved areas by a durable curb, edge,
or other designed feature. Planting beds must be planted with hardy plants and
general areas within planting beds must be planted with groundcover to reduce
soil loss.
         C.   Waste receptacle constructed of decorative materials consistent
with the district.
      (2)   Parking areas which front a public right-of-way shall be screened
from the public right-of-way by a thirty (30)-inch decorative masonry wall.
Such wall may be located directly along the front property line or may be
recessed and buffered by a landscape bed three (3) feet in depth.
   (c)   Signage. The MCOD encompass land in the City of Southgate’s “Downtown”
consisting of buildings with distinctive architecture. It is important to
capture and preserve the unique character of a downtown in the types of signs
permitted; therefore, all sign permit applications shall be reviewed by the
Building Director using the following guidelines.
      (1)   Location. Signs shall not cover architectural details such as
arches, transom windows, moldings, columns, capitals, sills, cornices and
similar details.
      (2)   Materials. Sign materials shall complement the building facade and
be consistent with the district.
      (3)   Lettering Style. Lettering style shall complement the building.
      (4)   Illumination. Signs shall be illuminated using a direct but
shielded light source, rather than internal illumination. The illumination of
any sign shall be subject to Building Director approval.
      (5)   Projecting Signs. Projecting signs shall be permitted provided they
are oriented towards pedestrian traffic, have a minimum under-clearance of
eight (8) feet, and do not project more than four (4) feet from the face of the
building to which they are attached.
      (6)   Colors. No more than three (3) complementary colors may be used per
sign, with generally one (1) color for the background, one (1) for the
lettering, and one (1) for accent. More than three (3) complementary colors may
be used for graphics or symbols on the sign.
      (7)   Murals. Permitted and regularly maintained as approved by the
Building Director.
      (8)   Sidewalk/Sandwich Board Signs. Sidewalk signs may be located
between the building line and private street curb lines only. Any sidewalk on
which such sign is located shall be at least six (6) feet wide and shall leave
at least five (5) feet of the sidewalk’s width open and unobstructed.
   (d)   Uses Permitted. Authorized uses are identified in Table 1. If a use is
not listed but is similar to other uses within a category, the Building
Director may make the interpretation that the use is similar to other uses. The
Building Director may also make the determination whether the similar use is
permitted by right, as a use subject to special conditions use approval, not
permitted, or permitted subject to use-specific conditions. The Building
Director may obtain a recommendation from the Planning Commission as to whether
or not the proposed use is similar to a specific use and whether the use is
permitted by right, as a conditional land use, not permitted, or permitted on
the upper floors only.

greater than the recorded ambient pressure level of sound generated by land use
on surrounding industrial properties in the City of Southgate. The Interstate
75 highway shall be excluded from any such measurements of ambient pressure
levels.
   (c)   It is further the intent of the M-1 District that any form of light
manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging or light assembly or
treatment shall involve only finished or semi-finished products from previously
prepared materials. The light manufacturing, compounding, light assembly or
treatment of any product that requires the processing of raw materials for
shipment in bulk form for use in an industrial operation at another location is
specifically prohibited.
   (d)   Based on the purposes of this District, all uses permitted herein
shall:
      (1)   Provide sufficient space in appropriate locations to satisfy
expectations pertaining to the City's future economy and employment base for a
limited type of light manufacturing and technical research oriented industrial
base.
      (2)   Protect abutting residential and non-industrial uses by separating
them from industrial uses with sufficient screening buffers and setbacks.
      (3)   Prohibit non-industrial oriented uses from further encroachment
into the remaining areas of the City proposed for light industrial and
technical research oriented land use.
      (4)   Promote light industrial and technical research oriented land use
of the type that will be able to adhere to strict Federal, State and local
environmental performance and safety standards.
      (5)   Promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with the land
use recommendations of the City's Master Plan Map, thereby protecting and
enhancing the character of the established pattern of nearby development, the
value of land and the use on it, as well as the industrial tax base of the
City.
(Ord. 604.  Passed 3-5-97.)
1282.02  PRINCIPAL USES PERMITTED.

1288.01  INTENT.
given area, other than by conventional zoning district controls. This
alternative approach to land development is designed to give greater
development flexibility, thereby encouraging higher dedication to quality of
land use and site design. It is further the intent of this development approach
that the alternative land use development patterns permitted in the PD District
will be designed and laid out with particular attention to creating a desirable
human experience by establishing harmonious relationships between land use
types relative to uses of land, the location of uses on the land and the
architectural and functional compatibility between them.
   (b)   A planned development project is viewed as an integrated development
concept. To that end, the provisions of this chapter are not intended to be
used as a device for avoiding the zoning requirements that would otherwise
apply, but rather to encourage the use, redevelopment, and improvement of
existing sites where current ordinances do not provide adequate protection and
safeguards for the site or its surrounding areas; encourage flexibility and
mixture of uses; and to improve the design, character, and quality of new
development.  The use of a planned development to permit variations from other
requirements of this chapter shall only be approved when such approval results
in improvements to the public health, safety, and welfare in the area affected,
and in accordance with the intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 516.  Passed 8-26-92; Ord. 945.  Passed 4-18-12.)
1288.02  MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR REZONING TO PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   A recommendation from the Planning Commission to Council to reclassify land,
and the reclassification of the land to a PD District by Council, shall be
predicated on both bodies finding that:
   (a)   The site contains at least ten net acres of contiguous land;
   (b)   The predominant use that is intended to occupy the land occupies at
least one-half of the entire net land area of the site; and
   (c)   The specific types of land use proposed are acceptable.
(Ord. 945.  Passed 4-18-12.)
1288.03  APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT; SUBMISSION; CONTENTS.

1288.04  REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission, upon receipt of an application to rezone and
develop under the PD Planned Development District, as set forth in Section
1288.03, shall first set a public hearing date for review of the application.
The Commission, in making its review, shall adhere to the conditions set forth
in this section.
   (b)   In considering a request to rezone land to a PD District, the
Commission shall recommend approval of the request to Council only after it
finds that:
      (1)   The request to rezone is being made with the full intent of
developing the land in strict accordance with the requirements of the PD
District.
      (2)   The uses proposed for development in accordance with the submitted
site plan are compatible with existing uses on adjacent lands.
      (3)   The area being requested for rezoning is either fully served by
public utilities and services such as but not limited to streets, police, and
fire protection, drainage, water, water and sanitary sewer, refuse disposal,
and sidewalks; or will be fully served through the extension of such public
utilities and services to the site at the time of development.
      (4)   The preliminary site plan is in compliance with the review criteria
set forth in this chapter and this Zoning Code. 
      (5)   The preliminary site plan is consistent with the City's Master
Plan.
      (6)   Each phase of the proposed planned development contains adequate
infrastructure, open-space, recreational facilities, landscaping, and any other
necessary conditions so that a failure to proceed with subsequent phases of the
development will have no adverse impact on the completed phases(s) or
surrounding property.
      (7)   The preliminary site plan meets all the requirements of Section
1298.07 for preliminary site plans.
      (8)   The plan satisfies the intent of this section with respect to the
use of land and principal and accessory use relationships within the site, as
well as with uses on adjacent sites.
      (9)   All existing or proposed streets, roads, utilities and marginal
access service drives, as may be required, are correctly located on the site
plan.
      (10)   The plan meets all applicable standards of this Zoning Code and
this chapter, relative to building height, bulk, area requirements, dwelling
unit density, building setbacks, off-street parking, and preliminary site
engineering requirements.
      (11)   There exists a reasonably harmonious relationship between the
placement of buildings on the site and buildings on lands in the surrounding
area, and there is functional compatibility between all structures on the site
and structures within the surrounding area to ensure proper relationships
between:
         A.   The topography of the adjoining lands as well as that of the site
itself, including any significant natural or man-made features;
         B.   One building and another, whether on-site or on adjacent land,
i.e. entrances, service areas and mechanical appurtenances; and
         C.   Street, road and public utility layouts approved for the area.
   (c)   Council Review or Preliminary Site Plan.
      (1)   Upon review of the preliminary site plan by the Planning
Commission, the Commission shall forward its findings and recommendations,
along with all plans and supporting documents, to Council for its review.
      (2)   Council shall review the preliminary site plan with regard to the
Commission's recommendations and the review requirements and conditions set
forth in subsection (b) hereof. Council shall approve the preliminary site
plan, provided that all the conditions as set forth in subsection (b) hereof
are met.
      (3)   Once the preliminary site plan has been approved by Council, no
development shall take place therein and no use shall be made of any part
thereof, until final site approval has been given by Council, and then only in
accordance with the approved plan or in accordance with an approved amendment
to that plan. 
      (4)   Approval of the preliminary site plan by Council shall give
appropriate direction to the applicant to proceed with development of the final
site plan.
   (d)   Final Site Plan.  A final site plan shall be prepared and submitted to
the Planning Commission for its review and recommendation to Council.
      (1)   The final site plan shall:
         A.   Contain all the requirements set forth in Section
1298.07;
         B.   Include plans and drawings illustrating, in detail, all physical
layouts as indicated on the approved preliminary site plan, as well as building
elevations of all building walls, including a legend detailing facade
materials, landscaping plans and other physical plan details, such as lighting,
signs, etc., being proposed. Supporting documentation in the form of building
plans and schedules of construction may also be requested.
      1.   The Commission, in making its review of the building wall elevations
and building facade materials, shall, to the best of its ability, be satisfied
that there exists a reasonably harmonious relationship between the location of
buildings on the site and the surrounding area, and that there is reasonable
architectural compatibility between all structures on the site and structures
within the surrounding area to ensure proper relationships between:
               i.   The rooftops of buildings that may be below street levels
or that may be seen from windows of higher adjacent buildings;
               ii.   Landscape plantings, off-street parking areas and service
drives on adjacent lands; and
               iii.   The architecture of the proposed buildings, including
overall design and facade material used. Architectural design and facade
material should be complimentary to existing or proposed buildings within the
site and the surrounding area. It is not intended herein that proper design
contrasts in architectural design and in use of facade materials is to be
discouraged, only that care shall be taken to ensure that any such contrasts
will not be so out of character with existing building design and facade
materials as to conflict instead of contrast with other buildings or to create
an adverse effect on the stability and value of the surrounding buildings.
      (2)   Final site plan review.  The final site plan, along with all
supporting documentation, shall accompany the Planning Commission's
recommendation for final review by Council. Council, in reviewing the final
site plan, shall find that:
         A.   The final site plan is in conformity with the preliminary site
plan and meets the conditions as set forth in subsection (e) hereof.
         B.   The dedication of public rights of way or planned public open
spaces, where proposed on the site plan or as may be otherwise required, shall
have been made.
         C.   In residential use areas, any prorated open space has been
irrevocably dedicated and retained as open space for park, recreation and
related uses, and all such lands meet the requirements of the City.
         D.   Where applicable, marginal access road easements or rights of way
have been provided.
      (3)   Granting approval of final site plan.
         A.   When Council finds that such conditions are met, it may grant
final site plan approval.
         B.   The granting of final site plan approval shall constitute
rezoning of the land contained within the approved final site plan to the PD
District. Rezoning under the PD District shall rely upon the plan submitted and
all supporting documentation. The plan, therefore, is basic to the rezoning.
Adoption by Council of the zoning ordinance amendment, the final approved site
plan and all supporting documents shall be made an integral part of the zoning
amendment to the PD District, and, for the purposes of recordation, shall be
referred to as "Planned Development No.      ," which number shall correspond
to the number of the amending ordinance, and which shall thereafter be recorded
with the County Register of Deeds.
      (4)   Revisions to approved preliminary or final site plan.
         A.   Revisions to an approved preliminary or final site plan shall
require the re-submittal of plan revisions to the City for an administrative
review. The City, in making its review, may require such revisions to be
resubmitted to the Planning Commission and Council for review and approval
when, in its opinion, such revisions constitute a major or significant change
in the previously approved plans, or when it feels such changes may compromise
the intent and review standards of the PD District as herein set forth.
Significant changes include, by way of example only and not as a limitation,
increased dwelling unit size or density, increased nonresidential use areas,
loss of substantial amounts of parking or relocation of buildings.
         B.   The Commission and Council, in making a review of a revised site
plan, shall find that any such revisions forwarded to them for review and
approval meet all minimum requirements of this chapter, including its general
intent.
      (5)   Approved period.
         A.   Approval of a preliminary site plan shall be effective for a
period of one year from the date of preliminary approval by Council.
         B.   Approval of a final site plan shall be effective for a period of
two years from the date of final approval by Council.
         C.   If substantial development is not evidenced on the site within
two years from the date of final approval by Council, all site plan approvals
may be terminated. Thereafter, the Commission may initiate the rezoning of the
property from a PD District to a zoning district recommended for the site on
the City's Master Plan Map.
         D.   Revocation may occur for the entire development or a particular
phase of development.  Thereafter, the Commission may initiate the rezoning of
the property from a PD District to a zoning district recommended for the site
on the City's Master Plan Map.
         E.   For purposes of this section, "substantial" means that at least
twenty- five percent of the development shall be in place, or well under
construction on the site, within two years from the date of final approval by
Council.

1288.09   HEIGHT, BULK, DENSITY AND AREA STANDARDS.
   (a)   It is the implied intent of the PD Planned Development District to
encourage quality  development by providing  for a diversified  mix of land 
use. It is further the intent of  this mixed use  district to encourage 
qualitative design innovation by minimizing specific height, bulk, density and
area standards, thereby giving the applicant freedom to configure buildings,
parking and related site amenities in ways that would otherwise be discouraged
or curtailed under the standards of conventional zoning districts. Freedom from
extensive layout controls is intended to encourage utilization of a site in
ways that will more fully satisfy the site review criteria set forth in the PD
District, so long as it is clearly understood that the absence of such
regulatory standards in no way implies, or is to be interpreted to mean, that
such critical site layout standards are excused or may be ignored with respect
to development in a PD District. To the contrary, proper building setbacks and
the thoughtful location and tasteful application of site amenities shall be
considered as crucial design elements of any development proposed under the
guidelines of the PD District and will be subject to careful review and
evaluation by the City. Site plans which minimize or show little regard for
such amenities will be subject to rejection by the City.
   (b)   Standards that apply to all development permitted in the PD District
are outlined in this section. Since it is the implied intent of the PD District
to encourage quality development through flexibility in and through land use
design innovation, only the following specified development control standards,
in addition to those set forth in subsection (a) hereof, shall specifically
apply:
      (1)   The minimum distance between nonresidential buildings, between
nonresidential buildings and multiple-family buildings and between multiple-
family buildings shall be subject to the formula provided in Section
1298.01(e) establishing distances between buildings, except that these
distances may be modified by the Planning Commission or Council at the time of
site plan review if it is found that the height and/or bulk of a building or
buildings is such that a greater or lesser setback would be warranted in the
interests of promoting the health, safety and common good of the community, or
in the interests of improving the visual aesthetics of the site.
      (2)   All buildings shall be located at least fifty feet from any public
street right- of-way line and at least thirty-five feet from any peripheral
site-boundary line, except that this distance may be modified by the Planning
Commission or Council at the time of site plan review if it is found that the
height and/or bulk of a building or buildings is such that a greater or lesser
setback would be warranted in the interests of promoting the health, safety and
common good of the community, or in the interests of improving the visual
aesthetics of the site.
      (3)   Single-family dwellings may be permitted subject to the conditions
set forth in Section
1288.06(a)(3), provided that the maximum number of dwelling units shall not
exceed the dwelling unit density permitted in the abutting single-family
residential district.
      (4)   Multiple-family dwellings may be permitted, subject to the
following applicable conditions:
         A.   Except for housing intended solely for the elderly (senior
citizen housing) and except for multiple-family dwellings occupying the upper
floors of multi-story buildings, no multiple-family dwelling building shall
exceed a height of thirty-five feet or three stories.
         B.   Multiple-family residential buildings of two stories or less
shall be subject to the dwelling unit density limitations and floor area
requirements of Section
1298.01(d).
         C.   Multiple-family residential buildings consisting of three stories
shall not exceed a maximum of thirty seven total rooms per acre.  No two and
one-half story buildings shall be permitted.
         D.   Multiple-family residential dwellings, when established as a part
of a mixed-use building, shall be located only in the upper floors of
buildings, provided that:
            1.   All retail commercial uses are located on subfloors below
grade, on the ground floor or on the ground floor mezzanine only.
            2.   No dwelling unit shall occupy any portion of the floor area at
grade level, and no nonresidential use shall occupy any area on the same floor
as a residential use or any area on a floor above a floor used for residential
purposes.
         E.   Multiple-family dwellings, when occupied solely as housing for
the elderly (senior citizen housing), shall be subject to the standards of
Section
1272.03(b)(1),(2) and (6) and the applicable standards of Section
1298.01(d) and (e).
         F.   Except for multiple dwelling units in the upper floors of multi-
story buildings, for which there is no maximum dwelling unit density, for the
purposes of determining overall dwelling unit density, the dwelling unit
density limitations applicable to each multiple-family development alternative
shall apply to an area within the residential development area of the site that
is to be devoted to that particular type of multiple- family development. 
These areas shall be clearly delineated on the site plan, and the area in
square feet of each of these multiple dwelling areas, along with the proposed
dwelling unit density of each, i.e. the number of bedrooms per dwelling unit
and the total number of rooms proposed, shall be noted in a legend on the site
plan.
(Ord. 516.  Passed 8-26-92; Ord. 945.  Passed 4-18-12.)
1288.10   REQUIRED CONDITIONS.

      (2)   No off-street parking shall be located closer than twenty feet to
any public street right-of-way line or closer than ten feet to any other
peripheral site boundary.
      (3)   Single-family dwellings may be permitted only when they are located
adjacent to a single-family residential district that is not separated
therefrom by a public street, freeway or railroad right of way, or which does
not contain a permitted nonresidential use.  All single-family dwellings so
permitted shall be developed in accordance with the one family cluster housing
standards of Section
1298.03 and shall be located so as to serve as a buffer between the directly
abutting single-family residential district and other residential and
nonresidential development within the PD District.
      (4)   When a planned development shall be developed in phases, each phase
shall comply with the phase development requirements set forth in Section
1288.04(b)(10).
      (5)   The applicant shall submit a detailed cost estimate for the
installation of all public utilities, streets and storm water retention systems
proposed for the entire development for review by the City.  Council may
require submittal of a surety bond or bonds in an amount or amounts equal to
the costs estimated for each phase of the above improvements, plus ten percent,
as a requirement necessary to receive final site plan approval from Council.
   (b)   See Chapters 1292 and 1298 for provisions regarding:

1291.01  INTENT.
   The RC Recreational District is designed and intended to permit the limited
use of land in the City for privately-owned indoor and outdoor recreational
uses that will be open to the general public and which, by virtue of their
size, are not generally conducive to commercial districts and which, because of
the potential intensity of the use, are not compatible with uses permitted in
Residential Districts. It is further the intent of this District to discourage
the types of athletic facilities that would occupy large tracts of land and
generate large volumes of traffic.
(Ord. 532.  Passed 6-30-93.)
1291.02  PRINCIPAL USES PERMITTED.
   In the RC Recreational District, no building or land shall be used and no

racing, dog racing and animal racing of any kind, any form of competitive motor
vehicle contests, theme parks, mechanical or electronic devices and amusement
parks.
   (c)   Uses which are customarily related or accessory to the above permitted
indoor and outdoor recreational uses when such uses will have no greater impact
on surrounding properties than the principal use of the site.
(Ord. 532.  Passed 6-30-93.)
1291.03  REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
   All permitted uses shall be subject to the following conditions:
   (a)   The minimum setback requirements for a principal use shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Front yard: forty feet, except that for each foot that the use
exceeds twenty-five feet in height, an additional one foot of setback shall be
provided.
      (2)   Interior side yard:  twenty feet, except that for each foot that
the use exceeds twenty-five feet in height, an additional one foot of setback
shall be provided.  When the side yard abuts a Residential District, a minimum
setback of fifty feet shall be provided.
      (3)   Exterior side yard: the same as that required for the front yard.
      (4)   Rear yard: the same as that required for an interior side yard.

parking may be located in a rear yard and in an interior side yard, except that
when these yards abut a Residential District, no off-street parking shall be
permitted within the minimum required setback.
   (e)   Whenever off-street parking is required to be set back from a property
line, the set back shall be landscaped and all landscaping shall be maintained
in a living, growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance.
   (f)   All uses shall have at least one property line along a major
thoroughfare as identified on the City's Master Plan Map, and all access shall
be directly from a major thoroughfare.
   (g)   The intensity of all exterior lighting shall be of a type that shall
not present a potential safety hazard to traffic on adjoining streets, nor
shall any such lighting adversely impact abutting properties.
   (h)   All accessory buildings shall comply with the applicable setback
requirements of Section
1298.04 including paragraphs (a)(6) and (7) of Section
1298.04 and any amendments thereto.
   (i)   The outdoor storage on the site of goods, materials or vehicles is
prohibited.
   (j)   All site plans shall be submitted for review and approval to the

1292.04  OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   On the same premises with every building or structure, or part thereof,
involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandise,
there shall be provided and maintained on the lot adequate space for the
standing, loading and unloading of vehicles in order to avoid undue
interference with the public use of dedicated rights of way. All spaces shall
be provided, where required in Section
1298.01, as follows:
   (a)   Within the RO District, loading space shall be provided in the rear
yard or, in the case of a double frontage lot, in the interior side yard, at a
ratio of five square feet per front foot of building up to a total area of 360
square feet per building.  However, if the use located within the RO District
does not sell or distribute merchandise or materials, no loading/ unloading
space will be required.
   (b)   Within the Commercial Districts, loading and unloading space shall be
provided in the rear yard at a ratio of ten square feet for each front foot of
building. In the case of a double frontage lot, loading, unloading and trash
receptacles may be located in an interior side yard beyond the minimum side
yard set-back requirement of the District. The location of such facilities in a
permitted side yard shall be subject to review and approval by the City. The
City, in making its review, shall find that any such use shall:
      (1)   Not have a disruptive effect on the safe and efficient flow of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the site;
      (2)   Be aesthetically and effectively screened from view from adjoining
properties and from a street, in a manner acceptable to the City.
         The City, to aid its review, may require the submission of building
elevations and cross-section plans showing grade elevations with respect to the
location of loading, unloading and trash receptacles, the corresponding
elevations of adjoining property and streets and the means by which these
facilities will be effectively screened from view.
   (c)   Within Industrial Districts, all loading and unloading operations
shall be conducted in the rear yard. In those instances where an interior side
yard is located adjacent to an Industrial District, loading and unloading may
be conducted in that interior side yard when located near the rear of the
building. When loading and unloading are to be conducted within an interior
side yard, the City may require aesthetic screening of the facility in
accordance with Section
1298.13.
   All loading and unloading spaces in Industrial Districts shall be laid out
in the dimension of at least ten feet by fifty feet, or 500 square feet in
area, with a clearance of at least fourteen feet in height. Loading dock
approaches shall be provided with a pavement having an asphaltic or Portland
concrete binder so as to provide a permanent, durable and dustless surface. All
loading and unloading spaces in Industrial Districts shall be provided in the
following ratio of spaces to floor area:
   Gross Floor Area (square feet)   Space Required
   0 - 1,400   None
   1,401 - 20,000   One space
   20,001 - 100,000   One space, plus one space for each 20,000 square feet in
excess of 20,001 square feet
   100,001 and over   Five spaces
   (d)   The area required for loading, unloading and trash receptacles shall
be computed separately from the off-street parking requirements and shall be
laid out in such a way that when in use it shall not cut off or diminish access
to off-street parking spaces or service drives.

review and approval, after a public hearing, of Council. Such a review by
Council shall consider abutting property and uses as they relate to easements,
rights of way, overhead lines, poles and towers, and, further, shall consider
injurious effects on property abutting or adjacent thereto and on the orderly
appearance of the City.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1294.03  VOTING PLACES.
   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall not be so construed as to interfere

Municipal or other public election.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1294.04  EXCEPTIONS TO HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.

1294.05  LOT AREA.
   Any lot existing and of record on the effective date of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 458, passed January 4, 1989) may be used for any principal use
permitted in the district in which such lot is located, other than for a
conditional use for which special lot area requirements are specified in this
Zoning Code, whether or not such lot complies with the lot area and width
requirements of this Zoning Code. Such use may be made, provided that all
requirements, other than lot area and width, prescribed in this Zoning Code are
complied with, and provided, further, that not more than one dwelling unit
shall occupy any lot, except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Code for required lot area for each dwelling unit, and except as provided in

   For the purpose of this Zoning Code, access drives may be placed in the
required front or side yard so as to provide access to accessory or attached
structures. These drives shall not be considered as structural violations in
front and side yards. Further, no walk, terrace or other pavement servicing a
like function, and not in excess of nine inches above the grade upon which it
is placed, shall, for the purpose of this Zoning Code, be considered to be a
structure, and the same shall be permitted in any required yard.

1298.01
1296.01  INTENT.
   It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit legal nonconforming lots,
structures or uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival.
   It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this
Zoning Code, and subsequent amendments, lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or amended,
which lots, structures and uses would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
under this Zoning Code or future amendments.
   Such uses are declared by this Zoning Code to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code
that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended or used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after the passage of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 458, passed January 4, 1989)
by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen
from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would
not be permitted generally in the district involved.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. "Actual construction," as used in
this section, includes the placing of construction materials in a permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. However, where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building involved.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.02  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code. This section shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements of the lot not
involving area or width, or both, shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. If two or more lots or combinations of
lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of
record at the time of passage or amendment of this Zoning Code, and if all or
part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as
established by this Zoning Code, the land involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for the purpose of this Zoning Code. No portion of such
parcel, which portion does not meet lot width and area requirements established
by this Zoning Code, shall be used or occupied, nor shall any division of the
parcel be made, which division leaves remaining any lot width or area below the
requirements established by this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.03  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, a
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under this Zoning
Code as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on such effective date.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use on such effective date.
   (c)   If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of more than twelve months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Zoning Code for the district in which such
land is located.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code, which structure could not be built under the
terms of this Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards or other characteristics of the structure, or its location on the
lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity. Such structures may be enlarged or altered in a way which
does not increase their nonconformity.
   (b)   If such structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than
fifty percent of its replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation, it shall
be reconstructed only in conformity with this Zoning Code, except that
reconstruction on the existing foundation or footings shall be permitted,
provided that such reconstruction is commenced within twelve months from the
date of such damage.
   (c)   If such structure is moved for any reason for any distance whatever,
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.05  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination,
exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code,
which use would not be permitted in the district under the terms of this Zoning
Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout parts of a building
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which existed at
the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or a structure and land in combination, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification, provided
that the Board of Zoning Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings
in the specific case, finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the Board may require conditions and safeguards in
accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code. Where a
nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in combination,
is hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be
changed to a less conforming use.
   (d)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for twelve consecutive months
or for twenty-four months during any three-year period, the structure, or
structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this provision.
   (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, the removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.06  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work
may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or
on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to
an extent not exceeding fifty percent of the assessed value of the building,
provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this Zoning Code shall not be increased.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.07  USES PERMITTED BY SPECIAL EXCEPTION.
   Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this
Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1296.08  CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing
nonconforming use of land, of a structure or of a structure and land in
combination.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS:
   (a)   See the following sections regarding flexibility allowances in
development within specified zoning districts:
      Section 1298.02.Subdivision open space plan
      Section 1298.03.One-family clustering option
      Section 1298.035.One-family site condominium option
   (b)   For all nonresidential uses permitted in a Residential District, all
setbacks shall be at least equal to the height of the main building, or when
such measurement is less than the minimum setback requirements of the district,
a setback equal to two additional feet for each ten feet or part thereof by
which the length of the building wall exceeds the minimum setback requirement
for the yard shall be provided, whichever is greater, except that no setback
shall be less than the minimum setback required in the district.
   (c)   (1)   All exterior side yards (street side, side yards) shall be
provided with a setback equal to the front yard setback requirement of the
district in which located, and all regulations applicable to a front yard shall
apply. However, in a Residential District when two rear yards abut each other
at a block end, the exterior side yard setback may be equal to the minimum
interior side yard setback of the District. When a nonresidential district
abuts a Residential District, the exterior side yard setback in the
nonresidential district shall be equal to one-half the corresponding yard set-
back requirement of the abutting Residential District.
      (2)   In addition to the specified side yards, no residential structure
shall be located closer than fifteen feet to another residential structure,
except that said distance may be reduced to thirteen feet for residential
structures with an attached garage, provided that said garage is attached to
that side of the structure wherein the 13-foot standard is utilized.
   (d)   (1)   In the RM Multiple-Family District, the total number of rooms
(not including kitchen, dining and sanitary facilities) shall not be more than
the area of the parcel, in square feet, divided by 1,550 for conventional
multiple dwelling units and 450 for senior citizen dwelling units, and all
public utilities must be available. All units shall have at least one living
room and one bedroom, except that not more than ten percent of the units may be
of an efficiency apartment type.
      (2)   For the purpose of computing the permitted number of dwelling units
per acre in the RM District, the following room assignments and minimum floor
area requirements, by dwelling unit type, shall apply:
Dwelling Unit Type   Room Assignment   Minimum Floor Area
Efficiency   1 room   500 sq. ft.*
One-bedroom   2 rooms   675 sq. ft.
Two-bedrooms   3 rooms   800 sq. ft.
Three-bedrooms   4 rooms   1,000 sq. ft.
*Minimum floor area required for senior (elderly) housing unit.
      (3)   For each additional bedroom over three an additional eighty square
feet of floor area shall be provided.
      (4)   Plans depicting one, two or three-bedroom units and including a
den, library or other extra room shall count such extra room as a bedroom for
the purpose of computing density.
         The area used for computing density shall be the total site area less
any dedicated interior or exterior public road right of way.
   (e)   In the RM District, each structure in the dwelling group shall front
either on a dedicated public street or approved private drive. An approved
private drive is defined as a nondedicated hard-surfaced drive or road.
      In the RM District, the maximum overall horizontal length of any one
building or group of buildings attached together over any portion of a common
party wall, or other architectural feature which attaches buildings together,
shall not exceed 180 feet, measured through the centerline of the building.
      Within any required front, side or rear yard setback from any property
line in an RM District, not more than thirty percent of any such peripheral
yard area shall be used for off-street parking, maneuvering lanes, service
drives, loading areas or combinations thereof.
      It is further required that off-street parking or related drives shall
not be located closer than twenty-five feet to any wall of a dwelling structure
which contains openings involving living areas, nor closer than eight feet to
any such wall that does not contain openings. No off-street parking,
maneuvering lanes, service drives or loading areas shall be located closer than
twenty feet from any public street right-of-way line and eight feet from any
other property line.
      In the RM District, the minimum distance between any two buildings shall
be regulated according to the length and height of such buildings, and in no
instance shall this distance be less than thirty feet. However, if there is a
corner-to-corner relationship between such buildings, the minimum distance
between the two buildings shall be fifteen feet regardless of any architectural
feature that may connect the buildings. The formula regulating the required
minimum distance between two buildings in the RM District is as follows:
                     L + L + 2(H + H)
                  S =   A  B    A  B, where
                        6
S = Required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of building A and any
wall of building B or the vertical prolongation of either.
   L A   =   Total length of building A.
      The total length of building A is the length of that portion or portions
of a wall or walls of building A from which, when viewed directly from above,
lines drawn perpendicular to building A will intersect any wall of building B.
   L B   =   Total length of building B.
      The total length of building B is the length of that portion or portions
of a wall or walls of building B from which, when viewed directly from above,
lines drawn perpendicular to building B will intersect any wall of building A.
   H A   =   Height of building A.
      The height of building A at any given level is the height above the
natural grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the
length of building A. Natural grade level shall be the mean level of the ground
immediately adjoining the portion or portions of the wall or walls along the
total length of the building.
   H B   =   Height of building B.
      The height of building B at any given level is the height above the
natural grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the
length of building B. Natural grade level shall be the mean level of the ground
immediately adjoining the portion or portions of the wall or walls along the
total length of the building.
   (f)   Except where otherwise provided in this Zoning Code, the minimum lot
area and width and the maximum percent of lot coverage shall be determined on
the basis of off-street parking and loading, greenbelt screening, yard setback
or usable open space requirements as set forth in this Zoning Code.
   (g)   Off-street parking shall be permitted in the front yard of the RO, C-
1, C-2 and C-3 Districts to a point not less than ten feet from the front
property line.
      No off-street parking shall be permitted in the front yard of an M-
1 District, except that up to five parking spaces exclusively marked for
visitor parking and required handicapped parking spaces may be located in the
front yard, provided that no such parking shall extend into the required front
yard setback of the District.
   (h)   Off-street parking shall be permitted in any side or rear yard, except
that exterior side yards shall be subject to the front yard set-back
requirements of the district and all regulations applicable to a front yard
shall apply.
   (I)   No interior side yard setback shall be required when a building wall
has no openings. If openings are provided in an interior building side wall, a
minimum setback of ten feet shall be provided.
   (j)   Where the rear of a parcel abuts an improved public alley, the right-
of-way width of the alley may serve as the rear yard setback, and except as
otherwise set forth herein, no rear yard shall be less than that required in
the district. In the Industrial Districts, any wall of an industrial building
facing a corresponding Residential District shall be set back from the
corresponding Residential District a distance equal to three feet of horizontal
distance for each foot of wall height.

1298.02  SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE PLAN.
   (a)   The intent of the subdivision open space plan is to promote the
following objectives:
      (1)   To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the
natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, hills and similar
natural assets;
      (2).   To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of residential areas;
      (3)   To encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open
areas while recognizing a reduction in development costs and allowing the
developer to bypass or preserve natural amenities or obstacles on the site; and
      (4)   To encourage the provision of open space within a reasonable
distance of all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the
development of recreational facilities.
   (b)   Modifications to the standards outlined in Section
1298.01 for R-1 One-Family Residential Districts may be made by the Planning
Commission, after a public hearing held as set forth in Section
1262.07, when the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The area and width of lots in the R-1 District may be reduced as
follows:
            Minimum Lot      Minimum Lot
            Zoning District   Area (sq. ft.)   Width (ft.)
            R-1         8,400      70
      Such lot area and lot width reductions are permitted, provided the
dwelling unit density is not greater than 4.3 dwellings per acre.
      The area used for computing density shall be the net site area, excluding
any dedicated interior public right of way and excluding rights of way of
boundary roads.
      (2)   Rear yards may be reduced by ten feet when such lots border on land
dedicated for private parks, recreation or usable open space area, provided the
width of the reserved land is not less than seventy-five feet, measured from
the rear lot line of any given lot to the nearest lot line of any opposing lot.
      (3)   Under paragraph (b)(1) hereof, for each square foot of land gained
within a residential subdivision through the reduction of lot size below the
minimum requirements outlined in Section
1298.01 for the R-1 District, at least equal amounts of land shall be reserved
for the common use of the lot owners of the subdivision and maintained by them
in a manner approved by the City.
      (4)   The area to be reserved for subdivision open space and recreation
purposes shall, in no instance, be less than fifteen percent of the net area of
the site, provided a parcel divided by a road or stream may be considered as
one parcel. Further, each such area of land dedicated for common use shall:
         A.   Not include any area used for street purposes;
         B.   Be designed and laid out in such a manner that it shall directly
border a majority of the lots within the subdivision;
         C.   Be provided with a significant means of access by streets or
pedestrian accessways to all areas reserved for the common use of the land for
those lots in the subdivision that do not directly border the common areas;
         D.   Be designed and laid out in such a manner that at least one
portion of the total common area shall be capable of being used for active
recreational purposes;
         E.   Contain no active recreational areas at or along the outer
perimeters of the subdivision, except that such areas may extend to the outer
perimeter of the subdivision when the area can be connected to like active
recreation areas in adjacent subdivisions. Open space areas, other than those
intended for active recreational use, may extend to or along the outer
perimeter of the subdivision.
         F.   Not include bodies of water and subaqueous areas unsuitable for
recreational purposes as part of the land area necessary to meet the minimum
requirements of this subsection when such land comprises more than twenty-five
percent of the total common area, except that lakes or ponds, when landscaped
and maintained as an integral part of a larger common area within the
development, may be included in usable open space computations; and
         G.   Be designed and laid out in such a manner that all land reserved
for common use shall maintain its natural drainage. The entire common area may,
however, be located in a floodplain.
   (c)   The reasonableness of the subdivision open space plan option on any
given parcel of land shall be subject to review and approval of the Planning
Commission and Council as to lot layout, street configuration and the location,
size and overall layout of the open space areas. Review of a conceptual
development plan shall first be made by the Commission for recommendation to
Council. Approval of the conceptual development plan by Council shall authorize
the applicant to proceed with the preparation of the preliminary plan based on
the general layout of the approved conceptual development plan.
   (d)   The Planning Commission and Council, in carrying out its review of the
common areas of the plan, shall find:
      (1)   The location, size and overall shape of the proposed common areas
are suitable for the purposes for which they are intended.
      (2)   Those portions of the total common land area intended for active
recreational purposes are of adequate size and shape to permit active
recreational use and are generally unencumbered by extensive tree cover, shrub
masses, changes in topography, poor soil conditions or other conditions that
would make use of the area undesirable for the activity intended.
      (3)   Whenever possible, the overall area of the common land flows
throughout the subdivision in such a manner that it will directly serve the
maximum number of lots possible.
      (4)   The overall area of common land, wherever possible, varies in width
so as to take advantage of the natural amenities of the site, such as ground
cover, streams, gullies, ground swales, etc., and so as to effectuate a more
pleasing appearance.
      (5)   Wherever a variance of the widths of the common area is proposed,
there shall be achieved, as closely as possible, a general balance between the
narrower common land and the broader common land.
      (6)   The location, size and shape of proposed access points, open
spaces, recreational areas and proposed accessory structures are clearly shown
on the plan and identified, and these areas and structures, along with general
use patterns and pedestrian circulation, relate well with the lots within the
subdivision.
   (e)   Under the subdivision open space plan, the developer shall reserve the
total park area in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) hereof at the time of
filing of the final plat as required in the Subdivision Regulations.
   (f)   Upon acceptance and tentative preliminary plat approval of the plat,
Council shall instruct the applicant to have prepared, for review and approval
by the City's legal counsel, a contract setting forth the manner of the
dedication and title of the open land or common area, the manner of ownership,
the restrictive covenants required for membership rights and privileges, the
manner of maintenance and the obligation to pay assessments for the same and
provision for the City to effect use and maintenance as proposed and assess the
cost thereof to the lot owners if necessary.
   (g)   Provisions for bonded or funded securities for the assurance of the
installation of required improvements, utilities and facilities shall be in
compliance with City requirements.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1298.03  ONE-FAMILY CLUSTERING OPTION.
   The intent of this section is to permit, through design innovation,
flexibility in the development of one-family residential housing patterns on
sites where the conventional subdivision approach to residential development
would either destroy the unique environmental significance of the site or is
impractical for conventional subdivision approach, or where a transitional type
of residential development is desirable. To accomplish this, the following
modifications to the one-family residential standards of this Zoning Code may
be permitted, subject to the conditions herein imposed:
   (a)   In the One-Family Residential Districts, the clustering of one-family
dwellings may be permitted. In approving areas for one-family residential
cluster development under this section, the Planning Commission shall find that
at least one of the following characteristics exists on the land:
      (1)   An area generally parallel to, and generally not in excess of 360
feet in depth, on those unsubdivided parcels of land abutting a major
thoroughfare or freeway of at least 120 feet of right-of-way width or greater
so as to provide a transition between such major thoroughfare and conventional
one-family detached housing areas; or
      (2)   An unsubdivided area which the Planning Commission finds:
         A.   To be of unusual shape;
         B.   To be composed of generally unbuildable soils over a majority of
the total site area;
         C.   To be characterized by major stands of trees, streams or other
natural or man-made watercourses which extend over the greater part of the site
and which, as significant natural assets, should be preserved; or
   (b)   The area to be set aside as open space shall represent at least twenty
percent of the total area of the site. Open space may contain accessory
structure and improvements appropriate for recreational purposes, such as
recreational trails, picnic areas, children's play areas, greenways, or lineal
parks.
      (1)   Open space should be designed and located to:
         A.   Be contiguous to all or most of the dwelling units on site;
         B.   Be between the cluster housing development and any adjacent
conventional single-family development;
         C.   Provide links to other permanent public open space when
applicable; and,
         D.   Preserve all sensitive environmental features and natural areas
of significant value.
      (2)   Open space shall not include:
         A.   The area of any street right-of-way;
         B.   Easements for utilities;
         C.   The required setbacks between residential structures;
         D.   Any parking areas; or,
         E.   Detention and/or retention basins.
   (c)   (Repealed)
   (d)   Under this section, the attaching of one-family homes in clusters, or
the detaching of one-family homes in clusters, shall be permitted subject to
the following conditions:
      (1)   The attaching of one-family homes within a cluster shall be
permitted when such homes are attached either through a common party wall or
garage wall, which wall does not have over fifty percent of an individual wall
or more than twenty-five percent of the total exterior walls of the living area
of a one-family home in common with the wall or walls of the living area of an
adjoining home, or by means of an architectural detail which does not form
interior room space, or through a common party wall in only the garage portion
of adjacent structures.
      (2)   The detaching of one-family homes within clusters shall be
permitted, provided such homes are spaced not less than six feet apart when
opposing dwelling unit walls contain no openings, and not less than ten feet
apart when opposing dwelling unit walls contain openings. The distance between
opposing garage walls within a cluster shall meet local fire codes, except that
in no case shall such walls be less than six feet apart.
      (3).   The maximum number of homes in a cluster may be subject to review
by the Planning Commission, but in no case shall a cluster contain less than
two homes or more than four homes.
      (4)   No structure within a cluster shall be located closer than thirty-
five feet to any interior private street or drive, public right of way or, in
the case of site planned development, peripheral property line.
         Clusters of one-family homes shall be arranged on the site so that
none shall face directly into a major thoroughfare, nonresidential district or
nonresidential use. All cluster housing units shall include at least one
attached enclosed garage with door for each dwelling unit. The Planning
Commission may modify this garage attachment requirement, provided that
detached enclosed garages are provided in groups that will not exceed the
number of dwellings in the cluster the garages are intended to serve, and
provided, further, that such garages are located within thirty-five feet of the
housing cluster they are intended to serve.
   (e)   Each cluster of attached or detached one-family homes shall be
separated from any other cluster of one-family homes by a minimum distance of
twenty-five feet. However, the Planning Commission may modify the strict
application of the distance in those instances where it is found that a natural
amenity would be destroyed, or that topographical or soil conditions or the
physical constraints of the site limit a practical dimensional separation of
clusters.
   (f)   An applicant seeking use of the one-family cluster option shall submit
a site plan to the Planning Commission for consideration. Such site plan shall
include an explicit statement from the applicant detailing how the proposed
site meets the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(2) hereof. The Commission,
in making its review, shall find that the site possesses at least one of the
requirements for qualification outlined in subsection (a)(1) hereof before
approving the application. The Commission shall conduct its review in
accordance with the public hearing requirements set forth in Section
1262.07.
   (g)   Site plans shall provide the following:
      (1)   The structural outline (building envelope) of all structures
proposed on the site;
      (2)   Architectural renderings of building facade elevations within a
typical cluster;
      (3)   The areas to be dedicated as open space and recreational use,
showing access, location and improvements. Assurance of the permanence of the
open space and provision for its continued maintenance shall be submitted for
review and approval by the City Attorney. The City Attorney shall review and
render an opinion with respect to:
         A.   The proposed manner of holding title to the open space;
         B.   The proposed manner of payment of taxes;
         C.   The proposed method of regulating the use of open land;
         D.   The proposed method of maintenance of property and the financing
thereof; and
         E.   Any other factor relating to the legal or practical problems of
ownership and maintenance of the open land.
      (4)   The location of access drives, streets, off-street parking areas,
sidewalks, trash receptacles, etc.; and
      (5)   The location, extent and type of landscaping in accordance with
Section
1298.09.
   (h)   The applicant shall submit, as a part of his or her site plan,
proposed building elevations and typical floor plans. Elevation drawings shall
be drawn to scale and need only be a sample of development throughout the site.
However, where more than one type of structural design is intended, sample
elevation and corresponding floor plans for each type shall be submitted.
   (i)   In reviewing the site plan for application of the one-family cluster
option to a particular site, the Planning Commission shall require that a
landscaped undulating earth berm, at least six feet in height at its lowest
elevation, be provided along the entire property line of any boundary line
abutting a major thoroughfare or nonresidential district. The berm shall not be
included as any part of a side or rear yard, but may be a part of an adjoining
open space area. Earth berms, where employed on the site, shall be designed so
as not to obscure clear vision at street intersections. The Commission may
permit an optional landscape treatment that is consistent with Section
1298.09 and that will serve as an effective screening barrier when a landscape
berm is not practical due to site conditions or constraints.
   (j)   Approval of a site plan under this section shall be effective for one
year from the date of approval, with one-year extensions permissible.
Development not started in this period shall be considered as abandoned and
authorization therefor shall expire. In such case, any proposed development
thereafter shall be resubmitted for review and approval by the Planning
Commission. Any proposed change in a site plan after approval has been granted
shall require review and approval by the Commission prior to effectuating such
change.
   (k)   Approval criteria. In addition to site plan approval, the Planning
Commission shall review and approve the one-family clustering option upon a
positive finding that all of the following criteria have been met:
      (1)   The design shall promote the goals, objectives, and policies of the
City's Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Open space areas shall be provided in suitable locations that offer
convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby dwelling
units. Such land must be maintained in a perpetually undeveloped state, and
there should be in place an agreement or plan satisfactory to the Planning
Commission which ensures proper maintenance of the open space areas.
      (3)   Natural assets, wildlife habitat areas, or sites having cultural
value shall be protected.
      (4)   Individual lots, buildings, and roadways, and open space areas
shall be designed to minimize their impact on environmental site features.
      (5)   Clustering of the dwelling units shall occur in a manner which
preserves the basic amenities and qualities normally associated with single-
family living (such as, but not limited to: privacy, personal open space, and
adequate lighting and ventilation) while allowing for innovative site layout
and open space areas.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89; Ord. 796.  Passed 9-8-04.)
1298.035  ONE-FAMILY SITE CONDOMINIUM OPTION.
   The intent of this section is to permit the development of single-family
detached dwellings by site planning the layout of individual dwellings and all
streets, utilities, open spaces, etc. To accomplish development under this
option, the following conditions shall apply:
   (a)   In One-Family Residential Districts, the site planning of individual
single- family detached dwellings may be permitted after review by the Planning
Commission of a site plan, submitted in accordance with applicable requirements
of Section
1298.08 and site plan review procedural requirements. The Commission shall hold
a public hearing in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section
1262.07 for the purpose of reviewing the site plan.
   (b)   The Commission, in making its review, shall find that the following
minimum standards are fully met:
      (1)   The maximum number of individual single-family dwellings per acre,
throughout the entire site, shall not exceed the dwelling unit density level of
the One-Family District in which the site is located.
      (2)   An area equal to the minimum land area requirement of the district
shall be provided for each dwelling unit, including the building envelope.
      (3)   Setbacks shall be provided for each building envelope equal to the
minimum set-back requirements of the district as follows:
         A.   Front setbacks shall be measured from the street right of way, or
from an equivalent line of a private street easement, to the front of the
building envelope.
         B.   Side setbacks shall be measured from building envelope to
building envelope and shall be at least equal to the total minimum side yard
set-back requirement of the district between two single-family detached
dwellings.
         C.   Rear setbacks shall be measured from the rear line of the
building envelope to the rear property line or to the nearest common space
area.
      (4)   All streets shall be built to public street standards and may be
dedicated to the City as public streets. All public streets shall be located
within appropriate rights of way as set forth in the City's Master Plan.
Private streets shall be located within an easement equal in width to a public
street right of way.
      (5)   All utilities shall be installed to applicable City or County
standards and shall be located within appropriate rights of way or private
easements.
      (6)   The maximum number of stories and building height restrictions of
the district shall be met as shall the minimum floor area requirements of the
district. Any detached accessory uses shall comply with the applicable
standards of this Zoning Code for such uses. Setbacks required for such uses
shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the land area boundaries required
in this section for each individual single-family detached dwelling.
      (7)   Single-family detached dwellings developed as site condominiums
under this option may be site planned as open space developments, provided that
all applicable requirements of Section
1298.02 are fully complied with.
(Ord. 465.  Passed 5-24-89.)
1298.036  OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT OPTION.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this Section is to provide an alternative means of
development to the landowner on land which is residentially zoned that would
create the same number of home sites, but cluster the homes on no more than 50
percent of the land, while leaving the unused land perpetually in an
undeveloped state by means of a construction easement, plat dedication,
restrictive covenant or other legal means that runs with the land as required
by Section 4(f) of State Public Act 207 of 1921, as amended (the City and
Village Zoning Act).
      (2)   These regulations are intended to provide flexibility in certain
zoning requirements to preserve the natural features in open space that might
be lost through more traditional subdivision development. Only land that is
zoned at a density equivalent to 2 or fewer dwelling units per acre, or, if the
land is served by a public sewer system, 3 or fewer dwelling units per acre,
are eligible for application of the provisions of this Section.
   (b)   Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following terms shall
apply.
      (1)   Adjusted parcel acreage. Net parcel area after the acreage of all
lakes, ponds, streams, 50 percent of regulated wetlands, property within a 100
year flood plain, public rights-of-way, and utility easements are deducted.
      (2)   Density. Equals the number of dwellings units situated on or to be
developed on the adjusted acreage parcel. Density of a site shall be based upon
the total dwelling unit count achieved from a concept layout plan prepared by
the applicant and accepted by the City showing the subject site as a single
family detached development meeting the design requirements established for the
zoning district in which it is located. (Please refer to Section
1298.01, Schedule of Area Regulations.) Actual density shall also be determined
by compliance with all setbacks, parking, open space and other site design
requirements. The resulting development yield, determined through such
computation shall be distributed throughout not more than 50 percent of the
subject site's buildable area. All remaining land area shall perpetually remain
in an undeveloped state pursuant to Section
1298.036(b)(3), below.
      (3)   Open Space Preservation Area. Any undeveloped land area within the
boundaries of the parcel within an open space residential development, which is
designed and intended to conserve on a permanent basis environmental features
for the common use or enjoyment of the residence of the development or the
public or dedicated to an agricultural use. Such open space may contain
accessory structures and improvements appropriate for recreational purposes, as
provided by ordinance, such as recreational trails, picnic areas, children's
play areas, greenways or lineal parks. The following are not to be considered
open space by this definition:
         A.   Golf courses;
         B.   The area of any street right-of-way proposed to be dedicated to
the public;
         C.   Access easements for private roads or underground or overhead
utilities;
         D.   The required setback surrounding an existing residential
structure that is not located on an individual lot or condominium site;
         E.   Parking and loading areas.
   (c)   Eligibility Criteria. In selecting the open space overlay option, the
applicant must present a proposal for residential development that meets each
of the following:
      (1)   Open Space. To be eligible for open space overlay option, the
proposed development shall contain at least 50 percent of the land area that
will remain perpetually in an undeveloped state by means of a conservation
easement, plat dedication, restricted covenant, or other legal means that runs
with the land.
      (2)   Unified Control. The proposed development shall be under single
ownership or control such that there is a single person or entity having
proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The
applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the
form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that
indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
      (3)   Protection From Development in Perpetuity. The applicant shall
guarantee to the satisfaction of the City that all open space preservation
areas will remain perpetually in their undeveloped state as required. Further,
subdivision open space lands or their use for other than recreation,
conservation, or agricultural shall be prohibited.
      (4)   Density Impact. The proposed type and density use shall not result
in an unreasonable increase in the need for or impact upon public services,
facilities, roads, and utilities in relation to the use or uses otherwise
permitted in this zoning ordinance, and shall not place an unreasonable impact
upon the subject site and surrounding land, surrounding property owners and
occupants, and/or the natural environment.
      (5)   Community Master Plan. The proposed development shall be consistent
with and further the implementation of the City Master Plan. as may be amended.
   (d)   Flexibility Allowances.
      (1)   Subject to the limitations specified below, the Planning Commission
may grant specific departure from their requirements of the Zoning Code for
yard setback, lot area and/or width, and bulk standards as part of the approval
process to encompass flexibility and creativity consistent with the open space
preservation concept, provided such modification results in enhanced buffering
from adjacent land uses or public rights-of-way, or further preservation of
natural features.
      (2)   Regulatory modifications are subject to variance approval by the
Zoning Board of Appeals. Appeals from the open space community plan are to the
Zoning Board of Appeals. Any deviation of an approved plan shall first require
review by the Planning Commission. This provision shall not preclude an
individual lot or dwelling unit owner from seeking a variance following final
approval of an open space community, provided such variance does not involve
alterations to open space areas as shown on the approved open space plan.
      (3)   A plan submitted in connection with the Section shall be subject to
the following limitations:
         A.   The minimum floor area for all units constructed under this
option shall be at least equal to the minimum floor area requirements for the
single-family residential district in which the project is to be constructed.
         B.   The maximum number of units attached shall not exceed four (4)
units per building. The maximum number of buildings allowed in any one (1)
cluster shall not exceed four (4) buildings.
         C.   The exterior design of the structures shall be compatible with
existing single family structures located in the general area of the project in
regards to architectural style, size, overall floor area and heights. Variety
in the design of individual units shall be provided by the use of design
details, which do not appeal to be continuous or repetitious. An exterior
design pattern, which is repetitious throughout the project, shall not be
permitted.

            1.   Spacing between groups of attached or between unattached
buildings shall be equal to at least twenty-five (25) feet in the Residential
Estates District, measured between the nearest points of adjacent buildings.
            2.   Any side of a building adjacent to a dedicated public right-
of-way or private street or drive shall not be nearer to such public right-of-
way or private street or drive than thirty-five (35) feet.
            3.   This nature of development, when abutting a front yard of an
existing recorded subdivision which is not a part of the project plan submitted
under this section, shall cause all dwelling units facing such subdivision to
relate through its front or entrance facade and shall treat such side of the
groupings as front yards.
            4.   No building shall be located closer than thirty-five (35) feet
to the outer perimeter (property line) of the site.
         E.   The maximum height of buildings under this option shall be
thirty-five (35) feet.
         F.   The location of open space preservation areas shall meet the
following standards to the greatest extent feasible:
            1.   The open space is provided along a public street right-of-way
to provide additional buffering from the traffic and enhance views from the
roadway provided the open space along such right-of-way shall generally have a
depth of at least fifty (50) feet.
            2.   The open space provides an ecological link to permanent open
space in the surrounding lands and is located to connect open spaces, public
parks or bicycle/pedestrian paths throughout the community.
            3.   The open space is designed and located to be contiguous to all
or most of the dwelling units. Open access to required open space under the
provisions of this section shall be provided.
            4.   All sensitive environmental feature areas, natural features
and animal and plant habitats of significant value are included in the open
space preservation areas and are adequately protected.
         G.   Where the proposed development abuts an existing conventional
single family use, an orderly transition shall occur, if sufficient area exists
within the parcel to allow it, using one or more of the following techniques:

grade elevations relative to the existing topography, all computations relative
to acreage and density, and any other details which will assist in reviewing
the proposed plan.
      (3)   All land not intended to be conveyed to individual dwelling unit
owners under this option shall be protected by conservation easements, plat
dedications, restrictive covenants, or other legal means which runs with the
land and which prohibits their development in perpetuity. Such legal means must
be approved by the City Attorney to assure such unused land remains perpetually
in an undeveloped site. The City may require the inclusion of open space
restrictions that prohibit the following:
         A.   Dumping or storing of any materials or refuse;
         B.   Activity that may cause a risk of soil erosion or threaten any
living plant material;
         C.   Cutting or removal of live plant material except for removal of

(Ord. 767.  Passed 11-20-02.)
1298.037  CONDITIONAL REZONING.
   (a)   Intent. Public Act 110 of 2006 authorizes the City of Southgate to
enter into conditional rezoning under MCLA 125.3405. The City of Southgate
recognizes that there are certain instances where it would be in the best
interests of both the City and the property owner seeking a change in zoning
boundaries, if certain conditions could be proposed by the property owner as
part of a request for a rezoning. It is the intent of this section to provide a
process by which the owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose
conditions regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning
request.
   (b)   Application and Offer of Conditions.
      (1)   The owner of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions
relating to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is
requested. This offer must be made at the time the application for rezoning is
filed. The owner shall also furnish documentation of ownership that is
acceptable to the City with the conditional rezoning application.
      (2)   The required application and process for considering a rezoning
request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning
requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the
requirements of this section.
      (3)   The owner’s offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and
rational relationship to the property for which rezoning is requested.
      (4)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require site plan approval under the terms of this section may only
be commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately
granted in accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (5)   The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of
rezoning consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are
entered voluntarily by the owner. The owner may withdraw all or change part of
its offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of City Council
provided that, if such withdrawal or change occurs after the Planning
Commission’s public hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning
application shall be referred back to the Planning Commission for a new public
hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review.
      (1)   The Planning Commission, after holding a public hearing and
considering the conditions voluntarily offered by the applicant, may recommend
approval, offer recommended changes, or denial of the rezoning; provided,
however, that any recommended changes offered by the Planning Commission must
then be voluntarily offered by the property owner in writing back to the
Planning Commission for further review.
      (2)   In reviewing an application for a conditional rezoning of land, the
Planning Commission shall consider the following:
         A.   Whether the rezoning is consistent with the policies and uses
proposed in the City of Southgate Master Plan;
         B.   Whether all of the uses offered as part of the conditions to the
rezoning, or if no specific uses are indicated, all of the uses allowed under
the proposed zoning district would be compatible with other zones and uses in
the surrounding area;
         C.   Whether any public services and facilities would be adversely
impacted by a development or use allowed under the requested rezoning; and
         D.   Whether the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning or offered
under the conditional rezoning would be equally or better suited to the area
than uses allowed under the current zoning of the land.
   (d)   City Council Review.
      (1)   After receipt of the Planning Commission’s recommendation and the
conditions voluntarily offered by the property owner in writing, City Council
shall deliberate upon the requested rezoning and may approve or deny the
conditional rezoning request.
      (2)   Should the City Council consider amendments to the proposed
conditional rezoning advisable and if such contemplated amendments to the offer
of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner, then the
City Council shall, in accordance with Section 401 of the Zoning Enabling Act
(M.C.L. 125.3401), refer such amendments back to the Planning Commission for a
new public hearing.
      (3)   In reviewing an application for a conditional rezoning of land, the
City Council shall consider the following:
         A.   Whether the rezoning is consistent with the policies and uses
proposed in the City of Southgate Master Plan;
         B.   Whether all of the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning, or
uses offered under the conditions to the rezoning would be compatible with
other zones and uses in the surrounding area;
         C.   Whether any public services and facilities would be adversely
impacted by a development or use allowed under the requested rezoning; and
         D.   Whether the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning or offered
under the conditional rezoning would be equally or better suited to the area
than uses allowed under the current zoning of the land.
   (e)   Approval.
      (1)   If the City Council finds the rezoning request and offer of
conditions acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a
formal written Statement of Conditions for Conditional Rezoning (“Statement of
Conditions”) acceptable to the owner. The Statement of Conditions shall be
incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance
adopted by the City Council to accomplish the requested rezoning.
      (2)   The Statement of Conditions shall:
         A.   Be in a form that is acceptable to the City and recordable with
the Wayne County Register of Deeds.
         B.   Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains.
         C.   Contain a statement acknowledging that the Statement of
Conditions runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land.
         D.   Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or
other documents that are necessary to illustrate the implementation of the
Statement of Conditions. If any such documents are incorporated by reference,
the reference shall specify where the documents may be examined. The documents
must be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and accepted by City
Council. Copies of them shall be placed in the Council records.
         E.   Contain the notarized signatures of all of the owners of the
subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they
voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the Statement
of Conditions.
         F.   Upon the rezoning taking effect through Council resolution, the
City of Southgate Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect the new zoning
classification along with a designation that the land was rezoned with a
Statement of Conditions. The City Clerk shall maintain a listing of all lands
rezoned with a Statement of Conditions.
         G.   The approved Statement of Conditions shall be filed by the City
with the Wayne County Register of Deeds and a copy of the recorded Statement of
Conditions provided to the property owner. The City Council shall have
authority to waive this requirement if it determines that, given the nature of
the conditions and/or the time frame within which the conditions are to be
satisfied, the recording of such a document would be of no material benefit to
the City or to any subsequent owner of the land. All City expenses incurred in
reviewing ownership documents and in reviewing and recording the Statement of
Conditions shall be prepaid to the City by the property owner.
         H.   Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned
shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating use and
development within the new zoning district as modified by any more restrictive
provisions contained in the Statement of Conditions.
   (f)   Compliance with Conditions.
      (1)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon
land that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and
maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set
forth in the Statement of Conditions. Any failure to comply with a condition
contained within the Statement of Conditions shall constitute a violation of
this Zoning Ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such
violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement
as provided by law.
      (2)   No permit or approval shall be granted under this section for any
use or development that is contrary to an applicable Statement of Conditions.
   (g)   Time Period for Establishing Development or Use. Any time periods
established for the development and/or use of the land shall be designated by
the Planning Commission. This time limitation may, upon written request, be
extended by City Council if:
      (1)   It is demonstrated to the Council’s reasonable satisfaction that
there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence
within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion
within the specified extension, and/or
      (2)   The Council finds that there have been circumstances beyond the
property owner’s control that have impacted the development or use of the
property.
   (h)   Reversion of Zoning. If the approved development and/or use of the
rezoned land does not occur within the time frame specified under subsection
(g) above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification. The
reversion process shall be initiated by the Planning Commission. The procedure
for considering and making this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter be the
same as applies to all other rezoning requests.
   (i)   Subsequent Rezoning of Land. When land that is rezoned with a
Statement of Conditions is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning
classification or to the former zoning classification but with a different or
no Statement of Conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning
pursuant to subsection (h) above or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions
imposed under the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. The
City shall record with the Wayne County Register of Deeds the Council
resolution stating that the Statement of Conditions is no longer in effect.
   (j)   Amendment of Conditions.
      (1)   After the City Council has approved the rezoning and the Statement
of Conditions, neither the City nor the property owner shall add to or alter
the conditions in the Statement of Conditions.
      (2)   The Statement of Conditions may be amended thereafter in the same
manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and Statement of Conditions.
   (k)   City Right to Rezone. Nothing in the Statement of Conditions nor in
the provisions of this Section shall be deemed to prohibit the City from
rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a Statement of
Conditions to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in
compliance with this section and the Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of
2006.
   (l)   Failure to Offer Conditions. The City shall not oblige an owner to
offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of
conditions shall not affect an owner’s rights under this section.
(Ord. 08-863.  Passed 4-16-08.)
1298.04  ACCESSORY USES.
   Accessory uses, except as otherwise permitted in this Zoning Code, shall be
subject to the following regulations:
   (a)   Accessory Buildings.
      (1)   Where an accessory building is structurally attached to a main
building, it shall be subject to and must conform to all regulations of this
Zoning Code applicable to the main building. If the garage is attached to the
front wall of the house there must be twenty-five percent of the front house
wall exposed.  In the case of an attached accessory building it would be
allowed to have an additional detached accessory building on lots over 9,000
square feet to a maximum size allowed in paragraph (a)(3) hereof. No accessory
building shall exceed the ground floor area of the main residence.
      (2)   In a Residential District, no detached accessory building shall
occupy more than twelve ercent of the total lot area.  No accessory building
shall exceed the ground floor area of the main residence.  However, only one
accessory building on lots under 9,000 square feet in Residential Districts
shall be allowed for each single-family residence, and such building shall not
exceed 600 square feet in gross floor area. On lots over 9,000 square feet an
additional size increase will be permitted as allowed in paragraph (a)(3)
hereof.
      (3)   Lots up to 20,000 square feet shall be allowed an additional 400
square feet. Lots up to 40,000 square feet shall be allowed an additional 600
square feet. Lots over 40,000 square feet shall be allowed an additional 800
square feet. If this above option is used a shed is not permitted.
      (4)   Accessory buildings shall not be erected in any required front yard
or in any required exterior side yard.
      (5)   No detached accessory building shall be located within an easement,
nor closer than ten feet to any main building, nor closer than eighteen inches
to any interior side lot line, or three feet from a rear lot line.
      (6)   A detached accessory building shall not be used for living space,
storage of commercial equipment or materials, or for commercial storage for
rentals of any kind.
      (7)   In those instances where the rear lot line abuts an alley right-of-
way, the accessory building shall be not closer than three feet to such rear
lot line. In no instance shall an accessory building be located within an
easement or dedicated right-of-way. In those instances where the rear lot line
abuts a street right-of-way, the accessory building shall be not closer to this
line than the required front yard setback in the district in which the property
is located.
      (8)   No detached accessory building in R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-2, RE, MH, and
RO Districts shall exceed one story or fourteen feet in height.
      (9)   To construct or replace a shed, a site plan shall be submitted,
approved and a zoning permit issued by the Building Department to the homeowner
or a contractor to ensure proper placement as regulated by this chapter.  One
shed shall be allowed in the rear yard at a maximum size of twelve feet by
twelve feet.  This shed must be on three and one-half inch thick slab with a
four inch wide by twenty-four inch deep ratwall.
(Ord. 924.  Passed 12-15-10; Ord. 942.  Passed 2-15-12.)
   (b)   Accessory Structures.
      (1)   Accessory structures, except where otherwise permitted and
regulated in this Zoning Code, shall be located in the rear yard and shall meet
the set-back requirements of an accessory building.
      (2)   Flagpoles may be located within any required front or exterior side
yard. Such poles shall be located not closer to a public right of way than one-
half the distance between the right of way and the principal building.
      (3)   Canopies covering gasoline pump islands may extend into the
required front or exterior side yards to a point five feet from the street
right-of-way line. No sign shall be placed on any canopy, other than a sign
showing the height of the canopy or a sign as permitted and regulated in
Section
1298.18.
      (4)   Ground-mounted private communication antennas shall be located in
the rear yard. However, such antennas may be located in a nonrequired interior
side yard when they will not be highly visible from a street when so placed.
      No private communication antenna, including an extendable antenna, shall
exceed the height limitations of the district in which it is located when fully
extended. Such antennas shall be placed so that a horizontal distance at least
equal to the vertical height of the antenna shall be provided between the base
of the antenna and the nearest property line. However, in those instances where
an antenna extending upward from the ground is also securely attached elsewhere
to a building, the required distance to the nearest property line may be
measured from the building attachment to the top of the antenna. Such an
antenna may be attached to a pole, to a tower or to a rooftop of a principal or
accessory building, provided all applicable structural and electrical code
requirements are met.
      Dish antennas located on the ground shall observe all setbacks pertaining
to an accessory building.
      Wiring between a ground-mounted antenna and a receiver shall be placed at
least four inches beneath the ground within rigid conduit.
      In Residential Districts, no roof-, pole-or tower-mounted antenna shall
exceed a dimension of eight feet by eight feet or a diameter of eight feet, or
project more than eight feet above the roof on which it is located or above the
maximum height limitations of the district, whichever is less.

shall exceed a dimension of twelve feet by twelve feet or a diameter of twelve
feet. A ground-mounted antenna shall not exceed a dimension of sixteen feet by
sixteen feet or a diameter of sixteen feet.
      (5)   Wind-powered generators shall be permitted, provided:
         A.   They are located in the rear yard only.
         B.   They do not exceed the height limitation of the district.
         C.   They are so located on the premises that a distance at least
equal to the height of the generator blades at their apogee is provided to the
nearest property line.
         D.   They meet all applicable structural and electrical codes
      (6)   Solar energy panels, when located on the ground, shall observe all
applicable requirements pertaining to an accessory building. When roof-mounted
they shall be mounted either flat against the roof surface or shall not project
more than four feet outward from the roof, measured from the surface of the
roof where so affixed to the furthest outward projection of the panel.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1298.05  OFF-STREET PARKING OR STORAGE OF MOTOR VEHICLES, COMMERCIAL VEHICLES
AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
   (a)   The off-street parking or storage of any mobile home, recreational
vehicle or recreational equipment in any Residential District shall be subject
to the following conditions:
      (1)   Except where otherwise permitted in this Zoning Code, the off-
street parking of a mobile home for periods exceeding twenty-four hours on land
not approved for mobile homes or mobile home parks shall be expressly
prohibited.
         All mobile homes owned by residents of the City and stored on their
individual lots shall be stored only within the confines of the rear yard and
shall, further, respect the requirements of Section
1298.04(a) insofar as distances from principal structures, lot lines and
easements are concerned.
         No such mobile home so parked or stored shall be connected to sanitary
facilities or occupied.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles and recreational equipment may be parked
anywhere on residential premises for not longer than forty-eight hours while
being loaded or unloaded in connection with its recreational use.
      (3)   Except for temporary loading and unloading as allowed by paragraph
(a)(2) above, all recreational vehicles and recreational equipment shall be
stored on a paved surface in the rear yard only and shall be subject to the
applicable conditions of this section regarding accessory buildings with
respect to height, yard coverage and setbacks. In the case of a corner lot
where the rear lot line is also a side lot line for the lot to its rear, the
storage of recreational vehicles and recreational equipment shall occur no
closer to the exterior side street lot line than the minimum required front
yard setback distance for the lot to its rear.
      (4)   Recreational vehicles and recreational equipment parked or stored
on residential premises shall be kept in good repair and shall carry a current
license plate and/or registration as required by law.
      (5)   At no time shall recreational vehicles or recreational equipment be
used for living or housekeeping purposes, nor may it be connected to water or
sanitary sewer facilities.
      (6)   The outdoor storage of recreational vehicles or recreational
equipment on any residential lot or parcel shall be limited to only that
equipment owned by or licensed or registered to the occupant of the residential
lot or parcel on which the equipment is stored.
      (7)   In the case of a multifamily dwelling, a complex of multifamily
dwellings or mobile home parks, the City shall require that a screened area, in

and storage of recreational vehicles.
   (b)   The off-street parking of commercial vehicles in any Residential
District shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   No person shall park, and no registered owner of a vehicle shall
permit to be parked, any commercial vehicle weighing in excess of 5,000 pounds
on any residentially zoned property in the City for any purpose or length of
time, other than for expeditious loading, delivery, pick-up or unloading of
materials, goods or merchandise, or for the purpose of carrying on a principal
use permitted on the property on which the vehicle is parked, as otherwise
provided in this Zoning Code.
      (2)   The above paragraph (b)(1) shall not preclude the parking on
premises of commercial vehicles that are the principal means of transportation
for a resident in the conduct of such resident's employment or profession,
provided:
         A.   They do not include semi-trailer trucks and tractors, utility
trailers, dump trucks, stake trucks, flat-bed trucks, and wreckers.
         B.   They are parked on a paved surface in a side yard or rear yard
only.
      (3)   The owner of residentially owned property shall not permit a
commercial vehicle to remain on such property in violation of this Zoning Code.
      (4)   In any proceeding for a violation of this section, where a motor
vehicle displays commercial license registration plates, such registration
shall constitute prima-facie presumption that it is a commercial vehicle at the
time of any alleged violation.
      (5)   In any proceeding for a violation of the weight limitations of this
section, the weight indicated on the vehicle's registration shall constitute a
prima-facie presumption of the weight of the vehicle at the time of any alleged
violation.
(Ord. 10-897.  Passed 2-3-10.)
   (c)   The off-street parking or storage of motor vehicles, where permitted,
in any nonresidential district, shall be subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   The on-premises parking of motor vehicles for the purpose of
loading or unloading of materials or products shall be permitted as regulated
in Section
1292.04.
      (2)   The outdoor parking of motor vehicles for periods of more than
eighteen hours shall be prohibited, except that the parking on premises of
vans, pickup trucks and similar single rear axle, step-type delivery vehicles,
excluding semitrailer trucks and tractors, when used as an integral and
necessary part of a business operation, may be parked on the premises for up to
sixty-four continuous hours, provided that:
         A.   Not more than three such vehicles shall be so parked at one time
during any sixty-four hour period.
         B.   They are parked in a uniform manner, neat and orderly in
appearance.
         C.   They are parked in the rear or side yards, away from any street
frontage, unless there is no other area on the premises where they can be
parked.
         D.   They shall not be parked in any required landscaped area nor in
any required off-street parking space, vehicle maneuvering lane or designated
loading or unloading areas, during business hours.
      (3)   No motor vehicle shall be stored outdoors in any nonresidential
district, except that motor vehicles for sale may be stored or displayed
outdoors when they are on the premises of a new car dealership.
(Ord. 492.  Passed 6-5-91.)
1298.06  USES NOT INCLUDED WITHIN SPECIFIC ZONING DISTRICTS.
   Because the uses referred to in this section possess unique characteristics
making it impractical to include them in a specific use district, they may be
permitted by Council, upon recommendation by the Planning Commission. The
Commission shall review any such use and make its recommendation after holding
a public hearing in accordance with Section
1262.07.
   In every case, the uses herein set forth shall be expressly prohibited from
any Residential District, unless otherwise specifically permitted in this
section.
   The uses permitted herein require special consideration since they service
an area beyond the City, require sizable land areas and/or create potential
control problems with respect to adjacent land use and use districts, traffic,
noise, appearance and general safety.
   Those uses falling specifically within the intent of this section are as
follows:
   (a)   Outdoor Theaters. Because outdoor theaters possess the unique
characteristics of being used only after dark, and since they generate a
concentration of vehicular traffic in terms of ingress and egress from their
parking areas, they shall be permitted in the M-1 District only and shall not
be adjacent to existing or planned residential areas. Outdoor theaters shall
further be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the
Director of Inspections and the City Engineer as to adequacy of drainage,
lighting and other technical aspects.
      (2)   Outdoor theaters shall abut a major thoroughfare, and points of
ingress and egress shall be available only from such major thoroughfare.
      (3)   All vehicles waiting or standing to enter the facility shall be
provided off-street waiting space. No vehicle shall be permitted to wait or
stand within a dedicated public street right of way.
      (4)   The area shall be so laid out as to prevent the movie screen from
being viewed from residential areas or adjacent major thoroughfares. All
lighting used to illuminate the area shall be so installed as to be confined
within and directed onto the premises of the outdoor theater site.
   (b)   Communication Towers and Collocations.
      (1)   Any new communication towers and their attendant facilities shall
be permitted in the M-1 District, provided that such towers are setback the
total height of the tower measured from the base of the tower to the property
line.
      (2)   In order to maximize the efficiency of telecommunication services,
while also minimizing the impact of such facilities on the City, co-location,
or the provision of more than one antenna and more than one user on a single
tower at a single location, shall be strongly encouraged. Before approval is
granted for a new facility, the applicant shall demonstrate that it is not
feasible to co-locate at an existing site.

1260.07(b), shall be permitted within a 1000-foot radius of a Residential
District, residence, school, library, park, playground, licensed day-care
center, as defined in Act 116 of the Public Acts of 1973, as amended (M.C.L.A.
722.111 et seq.), and/or a church, convent, monastery, synagogue or similar
place of worship. Measurement of the 1000-foot radius shall be made from the
outermost boundaries of the lot or parcel upon which the proposed adult use
will be situated to the nearest lot line of the Residential District,
residence, school, library, park, playground, day-care center and/or place of
worship.

turn around, including trucks.
      (5)   Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the site can be safely
and efficiently accommodated on the street(s) which the development will
access, as well as on the surrounding street system. If traffic impact is a
concern, the Building Department or the Planning Commission may require
submittal of a traffic impact report, to be paid for by the applicant.
      (6)   Satisfactory and harmonious relationships between development
proposed on a site and the existing development on contiguous lands will be
achieved through:
         A.   The location of loading and unloading areas and trash receptacles
so as to minimize their impact.
         B.   The use of screening devices of sufficient extent to carry out
the intent and purpose of the screening requirements of this Zoning Code.

laws.
      (11)   Landscaping within the site is located so as to provide an
attractive appearance throughout the site.
      (12)   Ground pole and exterior building wall lighting is such that it
will present a soft visual image and not a bright radiant or sharp light,
particularly with respect to adjacent land use.
      (13)   All natural and man-made site drainage has been satisfactorily
accommodated so as not to create excessive run-off or ponding on adjacent
properties.
   (k)   Site Plan Action. Site plans submitted to the Building Department or
the Planning Commission for review shall thereafter be acted upon in accordance
with the following procedures:
      (1)   Building Department. Upon completion of its review of a site plan
that the Building Department is authorized to review as set forth in this
Zoning Code, the Building Department shall:
         A.   Approve the site plan and notify the applicant in writing of the
approval.
         B.   Disapprove the site plan and notify the applicant in writing of
the reason(s) for disapproval.
         C.   Continue review of the site plan pending submittal of a revised
site plan by the applicant for further review by the Building Department.
      (2)   Planning Commission. Site plans submitted to the Building
Department for review by the Planning Commission shall be forwarded to the
Planning Commission for its review and action. Upon completing its review of a
site plan, the Planning Commission shall take one of the following actions:
         A.   Approve the site plan.
         B.   Table the site plan to allow for submittal of a revised site plan
by the applicant.
         C.   Approve the site plan subject to minor revisions. A minor
revision shall mean a simple change or modification to a single element of the
site plan which will have no effect on any other element of the site plan.
Approval given by the Planning Commission subject to minor revisions shall
never involve more than three such revisions.
         D.   Disapprove the site plan.
            1.   Any of the above actions taken by the Planning Commission
shall be followed by written notification to the applicant of the action taken
by the Planning Commission.
            2.   Site plans approved subject to minor revisions shall be left
to administrative review and approval of a revised site plan by the Building
Department, the Engineering Department and/or the City Planner. The Building
Department shall thereafter inform the Planning Commission in writing of its
action.
            3.   An applicant whose site plan was disapproved by the Planning
Commission may appeal that decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals in a manner
prescribed by ordinance.
   (l)   Applicant Options; Alternative Approaches.  Certain actions by the
Building Department or the Planning Commission may afford the applicant
alternative approaches to obtaining site plan approval. Upon notification of
tabling or disapproval of a site plan by the Building Department or the
Planning Commission, the applicant may:
      (1)   Revise the site plan accordingly and resubmit the plans to the
Building Department for further review by the Building Department or the
Planning Commission.
      (2)   Seek relief before the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) from the
reasons noted by the Building Department or the Planning Commission in its
action to disapprove the site plan. Application for relief by the BZA shall be
submitted by the applicant within twenty-eight days from the date of
notification. If not submitted within that time period, no appeal shall be
heard by the BZA.
   (m)   Effective Period of Approvals. Site plan approvals granted by the
Building Department, the Planning Commission, or the City Council shall be
effective only within the following time periods:
      (1)   Approvals of conventional site plans. Except as set forth in
paragraph (m)(2) hereof, site plans approved by the Building Department or the
Planning Commission shall be in effect for one year from the date of approval.
A one-year extension to an approved site plan may be granted by the original
grantor of approval.
      (2)   Approvals of planned development site plans. Site plans approved
under the guidelines of the Planned Development District (PD) shall be in
effect for two years from the date of approval. A one-year extension to the
originally approved site plan may be given by the Southgate City Council
following recommendation by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Termination of site plan approvals. Sites for which conventional
site plan approval has been granted but which are clearly not under development
within one year from date of site plan approval, and for which no extension has
been granted, shall thereafter be considered null and void and shall require
re-submittal for review and approval. In the case of planned development site
plans, approval shall become null and void two years after the date of site
plan approval.
   (n)   Amendments to a Site Plan Approved by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Minor changes to an approved site plan may be approved solely by
the Building Inspections Director provided that such changes meet the spirit of
the Zoning Ordinance and the applicant agrees. Minor changes to an approved
site plan may include the following:
         A.   Moving building footprints within the confines of the smallest
rectangle that would have enclosed each originally approved building(s).
Relocation of building entrances or exits, or shortening of building canopies.
         B.   Changing the angle of parking or aisle width provided there is no
reduction in the amount of required off-street parking or in reduction of aisle
width below ordinance requirements.
         C.   Substituting landscape plant species provided a nurseryman,
landscape architect, engineer, or architect certifies the substituted species
is similar in nature and screening effects and the requested species is
permitted under Section
1298.09 herein.
         D.   Change type and design of lighting fixtures provided an engineer
or architect certifies there will be no change in the intensity of light at the
property boundary.
         E.   Increase yard setbacks.
         F.   Changing the location of an exterior building wall or location
not more than ten feet because of a natural impediment or hazard such as
bedrock or muck soils, provided than in so doing no setback requirement of the
ordinance is violated and no significant reduction in safety or in the amount
of open space is thereby affected.
         G.   Re-occupation of an existing building(s) provided the proposed
use is permitted as a principal or special conditional use and the following:
            1.   The Building Inspections Director shall make a report of such
minor site plan amendments to the Planning Commission.
            2.   The Building Inspections Director shall request the advice of
the City Engineer and Planner when considering proposed minor modifications.
The Building Inspections Director may determine that the proposed modifications
require a complete site plan review by the Planning Commission, particularly
for sites which do not comply with previously approved site plans, sites with
existing or potential drainage problems, sites with parking deficiencies and
uses where there are general health and safety issues.
      (2)   If the Buildings Inspections Director finds than a proposed
amendment to an approved site plan does not qualify as a minor change, he or
she shall immediately notify the applicant, and the Planning Commission in
writing that the site plan approval has been suspended pending approval by the
Planning Commission of the proposed amendment. If construction has begun, a
stop work order shall be issued by the Director for that portion of the project
which is not in compliance with the ordinance. Once the site plan approval for
the project has been suspended, the applicant has the option of changing the
project plans to conform with the originally approved plan, or of submitting
the revised plans to the Planning Commission for review and approval. A change
to a site plan that would not be considered minor in nature may include:
         A.   A significant change in the character of the development. For
example, a significant change in the building style from what was approved by
the Planning Commission.
         B.   An increase in the overall building footprint larger than that
allowed in subsection (n)(1)A. herein.
         C.   A reduction in required open space.
         D.   A reduction in required off-street parking and loading.
         E.   The elimination of any site plan amenity approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (o)   Improvement Guarantee.
      (1)   Guarantee(s) in the form of a cash deposit, certified check,
irrevocable bank letter or credit, surety bond, etc., may be required by the
City to be provided in a form acceptable to the City by a project developer.
      (2)   The amount of such guarantee(s) can be made by the City to cover
all improvements not normally covered in the building permit, including, but
not limited to: landscaping, including earth berms; walls; lighting; surfacing
of drives, parking, vehicle maneuvering lanes, including acceleration and
deceleration lanes, and other traffic control and traffic circulation
improvements; sidewalks; etc.
      (3)   The guarantee(s) shall include a schedule of costs assigned to the
several improvements. Monies may be released, but are not required to be
released, to the applicant in proportion to work completed and accepted on the
various improvements. The City reserves the right to retain all the funds until
the project is fully completed and accepted by the City.
      (4)   Any partial release of funds shall leave a balance of not less than
twenty percent of the guarantee, which shall be retained by the City until all
work has been completed and subsequently inspected and approved by the City.

1298.09  LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Generally.  Landscape planting screens or landscape plantings required
or permitted by this Zoning Code as an alternative to a screen wall or earth
berm, and such trees as are required by
Chapter 1028 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code to be planted
in the lawn extension or public way, shall be planted in accordance with an
approved planting plan and planted to completion prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy by the City if the use is ready for occupancy between
April 15 and October 21.  If a use is ready for occupancy between November 1
and April 14, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued, but all
required plantings shall be placed to completion within sixty days after April
14.
   Failure to have such required plantings placed to completion within sixty
days after April 14 shall be grounds for termination or revocation of the
temporary certificate of occupancy.  No additional certificate of occupancy,
either temporary or final, shall be issued thereafter until all required
landscape plantings are placed to completion.
   All plantings shall be properly planted so as to be in a healthy, growing
condition at the commencement of the establishment period.  During the
specified period of establishment, the contractor shall be responsible for
maintaining the plants in a healthy, growing condition, which responsibility
shall include watering, cultivation and weed control.
(Ord. 483.  Passed 8-29-90.)
   (b)   Required Planting Screens.
      (1)   Wherever in this Zoning Code a landscape planting screen or
landscape plantings are required, such landscape planting shall be subject to
the following conditions:
         A.   All plant materials shall meet current American Association of
Nurserymen standards.
         B.   All plantings shall consist of permanent, living plant materials
and, when planted to completion, shall thereafter be maintained in an

shall be continuously maintained in a sound, healthy and vigorous growing
condition, free of plant diseases and insect pests.
      (2)   Whenever a landscape planting screen is required under this Zoning
Code, a detailed planting plan of such screen shall be submitted to and
approved by the Planning Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit.
The planting plan shall indicate, to scale, the location, spacing, starting
size and description for each unit of plant material proposed for use within
the required screening area. Detailed plans shall be submitted in accordance
with the following:
         A.   The minimum scale shall be one inch equals forty feet when
submitted with no other drawings. When submitted with a site plan drawn to
another scale, the planting plan may be made a part of the site plan or, if
submitted separately with a site plan, it shall be drawn at the same scale as
the site plan.
         B.   The planting plan shall indicate the location, size, spacing and
root type (bare root or balled and burlap) of all plant materials.
         C.   The planting plan shall depict typical straight cross-sections,
including slope, height and width of berms, and the type of ground cover, any
masonry walls and the height and type of construction of all, including
footings, where applicable.
         D.   The planting plan shall depict significant construction details,
where applicable, to resolve specific site conditions (e.g. tree wells to
preserve existing trees, culverts to maintain natural drainage patterns, etc.).
         E.   The planting plan shall indicate existing tree cover that is to
be used in conjunction with or in place of the screen planting requirements of
this Zoning Code, including types of trees and overall tree height.
      (3)   Cost estimates covering all new plantings contained on the planting
plan, together with a surety acceptable to the City, other than a bond, in an
amount sufficient to ensure completion within the time specified and in
accordance with the planting plan, shall be submitted with the detailed
planting plan.
      (4)   The planting plan shall be reviewed relative to:
         A.   The proper type, spacing, height, placement and location of plant
materials relative to the length and width of the screen so as to ensure that
the required horizontal and vertical obscuring effect of proposed land uses
will be achieved;
         B.   The choice and selection of plant materials so as to ensure that
root systems will not interfere with public utilities and so that fruit and
other debris, except leaves, will not constitute a nuisance within public
rights of way or to abutting property owners;
         C.   The choice and selection of plant materials so as to ensure that
the type of plantings selected will be of a type that will survive and thrive
in the area in which they are to be located;
         D.   The proper relationship between any existing and proposed
deciduous and evergreen plant materials so as to ensure that the desired
obscuring effect will be accomplished; and
         E.   The size of plant material (both starting and ultimate) to ensure
adequate maturity and optimum screening effects of the proposed plant
materials.
      (5)   Landscape planting screens, as required in this Zoning Code, when
permitted as an alternative to a masonry screening wall or earth berm or in
conjunction with either, shall be laid out in conformity with the following:
         A.   Plant materials shall not be located within four feet of the
property line.
         B.   Where plant materials are placed in two or more rows, plantings
shall be staggered in rows.
         C.   Evergreen trees shall be not less than five feet in height when
planted in informal groupings. They shall be spaced not less than fifteen feet
apart on centers. When spaced farther apart, additional screen plantings shall
be used to achieve the desired screening effect intended by this section. When
planted in rows, they shall be planted not more than ten feet on centers.
         D.   Narrow evergreen trees shall be not less than five feet in
height. When planted in informal groupings, they shall be spaced not more than
ten feet on centers. When planted in rows, they shall be planted not more than
five feet on centers.
         E.   Large shrubs shall be not less than thirty inches in height. When
planted in informal groupings, they shall be spaced not more than six feet on
centers. When planted in single rows, they shall not be more than four feet on
centers.
         F.   Small shrubs shall be not less than thirty inches in spread. They
shall be planted not more than four feet on centers.
         G.   Large deciduous trees shall be not less than two and one-half
inches in trunk caliper. For the purpose of this section, the caliper of the
trunk shall be taken six inches above the ground level for trees up to and
including four-inch caliper size and twelve inches above the ground level for
larger trees. When placed in informal groupings, they shall be planted not more
than thirty feet on centers.
         H.   Small deciduous trees shall be not less than two inches in trunk
caliper. When planted in informal groupings, they shall be spaced not more than
fifteen feet on centers.
   (c)   Landscape Plantings. Landscape plantings used for cosmetic purposes
and not as required screen plantings may be planted as desired throughout the
site, but shall at least be planted within those minimum required landscape
planting areas set forth in this Zoning Code.
   Whenever any cosmetic planting areas are required, or whenever planting
screens approach a street or driveway intersection, the clear corner
requirements of Section
1298.12 shall be observed. However, in all cases, care shall be taken relative
to plant material, height and location so as not to create a traffic hazard.
   Plantings used for cosmetic purposes shall consist of the suggested plant
materials outlined in this section, except that Red Maple trees may be used
within interior lawn or planting areas when they are located safely away from
any building, driveway, street frontage or off-street parking area.
   Development which occurs in a nonresidential district shall provide, in
addition to any existing or proposed street right of way, at least ten percent
of the net site area (exclusive of buildings, off-street parking areas, etc.)
as landscaped open space. Pedestrian walkways, plazas, planters and other
decorative elements may be included in such landscaped areas.
   (d)   Exterior Equipment Screens. All exterior climate control and other
mechanical equipment and utility outlets (i.e. electrical, gas regulators,

   (b)   For those districts and uses listed in subsection (a) hereof, there
may be provided, in lieu of an obscuring wall, an obscuring landscaped earth
berm (earth mound). When such earth berm is provided in place of a wall, or in
combination with a wall, the berm shall be landscaped and maintained in a
clean, orderly and growing condition, and shall meet the following minimum
design standards:
      (1)   Continuous earth berms shall be provided with an undulating
horizontal and vertical top and sides. The height of the earth berm shall be
not less than required for a wall in the district. Earth berms may consist of
opaque screen plantings within the horizontal berm depressions or architectural
masonry walls, or a combination of both, so long as the minimum required height
of the earth berm plantings or walls, or a combination thereof, is maintained.
      (2)   Berms shall be a landscaped earth mound possessing a maximum slope
ratio of three feet of horizontal plane for each one foot of vertical height.
The berm shall have a nearly flat horizontal area at its crest of at least two
feet in width. The side slopes shall be protected from erosion by sodding or
seeding. Sodding shall be used only if the sodded areas are provided with
irrigation. If seeded, they shall be protected with a straw mulch held in place
by jute netting until a permanent lawn is established. However, other nets
designed and intended to control erosion may be used as well.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall review the effectiveness of an earth
berm against other screening devices set forth in this Zoning Code and shall
determine if the berm is an acceptable alternative. The Commission, in making
its review, shall consider the type of objects to be screened, the type of land
use that the objects are to be screened from, topographic conditions in the
area and general appearances.
   (c)   Required walls or earth berms shall be located on the lot line, except
where the standards of this section require them to be located on the
residential side of an alley or located immediately adjacent to a parking lot
in a Residential District, and except:
      (1)   Where underground utilities interfere;
      (2)   Where this Zoning Code requires conformity with front yard setback
lines in abutting Residential Districts;
      (3)   Where a nonresidential district is located directly across a street
from a Residential District, in which case the wall shall be placed on a line
parallel to and twelve feet, six inches back from the street right-of-way line.
The wall shall parallel the nonresidential frontage for the full extent that
the nonresidential district lies across the street from the Residential
District. The area between the wall and the street right-of-way line shall be
landscaped with lawn, shrubs and trees.
   (d)   Required walls shall be located on the opposite side of an alley right
of way from a nonresidential district that abuts a Residential District.
   (e)   Required walls shall be constructed of architectural masonry materials
which may include all decorative masonry units, i.e. monolithic and/or precast
concrete walls. Precast concrete walls shall be stained (not painted) in colors
complementary to the color of exterior materials used in buildings on the site.

1298.14  FENCES.
   (a)   Permits.  To construct or replace a partition fence, a site plan shall
be submitted and approved, and a zoning permit issued by the Building
Department to the property owner or contractor, to ensure proper placement as
regulated by this chapter.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Specifications for Partition Fences.  Any
owner of a lot in the City may construct and maintain partition fences between
his or her own lot and the next adjoining lots.  Such partitions include any
barrier constructed or reconstructed to partition all or part of a lot,
including cyclone or chain-link fences, split-rail or ranch-type fences,
ornamental or privacy fences, hedges and shrubbery utilized as a means of
division, and other similar means of partitioning an area.
   All other partition fences shall be constructed of self-supporting posts, at
a maximum height of six feet, eight inches.  The material and design of same
shall be approved by the Building Department.  Chain-link fences which contain
colored slats for screening that are woven between the links shall be of a
neutral color (beige, tan, cream, etc.) and shall be kept in good repair.
   (c)   Barbed Wire Fences.  No person shall place or maintain any barbed wire
fencing or any strands of barbed wire along the line of or in any public
street, alley, sidewalk or other public place in the City, nor shall any person
build or maintain any line fence composed wholly or partly of barbed wire. 
This section may be waived upon application to Council, and Council may, in its
discretion, grant permission for the installation of strands of barbed wire
upon the top of any fence surrounding nonresidential property, and not abutting
residential property, where Council deems such installation of barbed wire to
be necessary for the protection of the improvements or goods contained within
the area so fenced from theft, vandalism, injury or other malicious mischief.
   (d)   Decorative Front Yard  Fences.  A decorative fence is one that's
primary purpose is to contribute to the overall aesthetic of the residential
structure. Decorative fences may be installed in accordance with the following
conditions and with the approval of the Building Department.
      (1)   The decorative fence may be installed in the front yard provided
the fence is placed along the side property lines from the front building line
to within one foot of the sidewalk.
      (2)   The maximum height of such fence shall be no taller than thirty
inches from the grade.
      (3)   All fence material shall be painted and kept in good repair.
      (4)   Decorative fencing shall be constructed of wood, vinyl, wrought
iron, or other decorative material.  Chain-line is not considered a decorative
fence.
   (e)   Side Lot Line Fences.
      (1)   Side lot line fences may be erected from the rear lot line to
within six feet of the front building line.  The Building Official may approve
an exception to allow the fence to be developed to the front building line in
the case of extenuating circumstances, such as the screening of mechanical
equipment a side door closer than six feet to the front of the building, etc.
      (2)   Residential lots or parcels of land adjacent to a public alley or
commercial property may extend a privacy fence to the front line of such
property upon determination by the Building Department that the extension is
necessary to protect the residents of the property from noise, traffic, debris
or other invasion of property.  However, at a distance of fifteen feet from the
front property line, the privacy fence must be reduced to three feet in height
to accommodate clear corner site distances.
   (f)   Surveys; Mutual Agreements.  Adjacent owners of lots, between which a
partition fence is to be erected where no fence previously existed or where a
fence exists and is to be relocated, shall obtain the services of a registered
land surveyor who shall establish the partition line between such lots by
installing suitable markers at the corners of said lots. A certificate of the
registered surveyor indicating that the markers have been placed as required
shall be presented to the Building Department before a permit to erect the
fence will be issued.
   Where adjacent property owners mutually agree upon the location of a
partition fence, a written statement to that effect signed by both adjoining
property owners shall be presented to and approved by the Building Department
in lieu of the certificate of a registered surveyor. The adjacent property
owners will then be responsible for the placement of the partition fence.
   (g)   Maintenance.
      (1)   When a solid or opaque fence is constructed immediately adjacent to
an existing chain-link fence it shall be the responsibility of the new fence
owner to maintain the property that is located between the existing and new
fence.  This property shall be kept in an orderly appearance, free of weeds or
other noxious plant materials.
      (2)   When the fence is adjacent to a public right-of-way, it shall be
treated to minimize or eliminate the possibility of graffiti.

Zoning Code unless such lot or parcel fronts directly upon a public street,
unless otherwise provided for in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1298.16  ACCESS TO MAJOR THOROUGHFARES.
   For uses making reference to this section, vehicular access shall be
provided only to an existing or planned major thoroughfare or freeway service
drive. However, access driveways may be permitted to other than a major
thoroughfare or freeway service drive where such access is provided to a street
where the property directly across the street, between the driveway and the
major thoroughfare or freeway service drive, is zoned for multifamily use or
any nonresidential use, is developed with permanent uses other than single-
family residences or is an area which, in the opinion of the City, will be used
for other than single-family purposes in the future. This exception shall apply
only if the City finds that there are special circumstances which indicate that
there will be a substantial improvement in traffic safety by reducing the
number of driveways to a thoroughfare.
(Ord. 458.  Passed 1-4-89.)
1298.17  EXTERIOR BUILDING WALL MATERIALS.

standards set forth in this section apply, they shall be accompanied by a
statement describing how the exterior building wall material or combination of
materials, as set forth in this section, is consistent with the materials on a
majority of the buildings in the surrounding neighborhood.  For the purpose of
this subsection, the following additional standards shall apply:
      (1)   When four or more new single-family or two-family dwellings are
erected on contiguous lots or condominium home sites, they shall consist of

1460.01  DANGEROUS BUILDING DEFINED.
   As used in this chapter, "dangerous building" means any building or
structure which has any of the following defects or is in any of the following
conditions:
   (a)   Whenever the clear width of any doorway, hallway, passageway, stairway
or other means of egress is reduced or obstructed in any manner not consistent
with this Building and Housing Code and deemed inadequate for safety by the
Director of Inspections;
   (b)   Whenever any portion has been damaged by fire, wind, flood or any
other cause in such a manner that the structural strength or stability is
appreciably less than it was before such catastrophe, and is less than the
minimum requirements of this Building and Housing Code for a new building or
similar structure, purpose or location;
   (c)   Whenever any portion, member or appurtenance is likely to fall, to
become detached or dislodged or to collapse and thereby injure persons or
damage property;
   (d)   Whenever any portion has settled to such an extent that walls or other
structural portions have materially less resistance to wind than is required in
the case of new construction by this Building and Housing Code;
   (e)   Whenever the building or structure, or any part thereof, because of
dilapidation, deterioration, decay or faulty construction, or because of the
removal or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the purpose of
supporting such building or portion thereof, or for any other reason, is likely
to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of the foundation or
underpinning is likely to fall or give way;
   (f)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is used;
   (g)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind
or flood, or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated, as to become an
attractive nuisance to afford a harbor for vagrants, criminals or immoral
persons, or as to enable persons to resort thereto for the purpose of
committing a nuisance or unlawful or immoral act;
   (h)   Whenever a building or structure used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage or faulty
construction or arrangement, is in a condition that is likely to cause sickness
or disease, when so determined by the Health Officer, or is likely to work
injury on the health, safety or general welfare of persons living within;
   (i)   Whenever any building becomes vacant, dilapidated and open at doors or
windows, leaving the interior of the building exposed to the elements or
accessible to entrance by trespassers;
   (j)   Whenever any building or structure has light, air or sanitation
facilities which are inadequate to protect the health, morals, safety or
general welfare of persons who live or may live therein; or
   (k)   Whenever any building or structure has improperly distributed loads
upon the floors, or in which the same are overloaded or have insufficient
strength to be reasonably safe for the purposes for which the building or
structure is or is likely to be used.
(Ord. 446.  Passed 5-11-88.)

and the City Charter.
   (b)   Each owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears
upon the last local tax assessment records shall be notified of the amount of
such cost by first-class mail at the address shown on the records. If such
amount is not paid within thirty days after such mailing, the assessing officer
shall add the same to the next tax roll of the City and the same shall be
collected in the same manner as provided by law for the collection of taxes by
the City.
(Ord. 446.  Passed 5-11-88.)
1460.12  REMOVAL AND STORAGE OF BUILDING CONTENTS.
   (a)   If Council orders that a building be demolished, the Director of
Public Services shall determine the date for demolition and shall notify each
owner or party in interest thereof in the manner set forth in this chapter.
Such notice shall request that the owner or party in interest remove any
contents of the building which are of value to him or her.
   (b)   If, on the date set for demolition, the contents remain in the
building, which contents, in the opinion of the Director, are of more than
nominal value, then the Director shall cause such contents to be removed from
the building and stored for not more than thirty days. The owner or party in
interest shall be notified that during the period of storage the contents may
be claimed upon payment of a reasonable storage fee. Upon expiration of the
storage period, the contents shall be considered to be abandoned and may be
disposed of by the usual method of disposal of abandoned property. The
demolition charges to the owner or party in interest shall then be reduced by
any amount the City receives for the sale of the abandoned property which is in
excess of the City's expenses for the removal and storage of the same.
(Ord. 446.  Passed 5-11-88.)
1460.13  APPEALS.

1464.01  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 275.  Passed 8-30-78.)
1464.02  PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize flood blight
areas;
   (g)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
   (h)   Ensure that persons who occupy an area of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 275.  Passed 8-30-78.)
1464.03  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
   (a)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (b)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (c)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (d)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 275.  Passed 8-30-78.)
1464.04  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. As used in this

or City Engineer's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request
for a variance.
   (b)   "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO Zone on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate and where velocity flow may be evident.
   (c)   "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the flood plain
within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in
any given year.
   (d)   "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equalled or exceeded in any given year.
   (e)   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures and
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations
located in the area of special flood hazard.
   (f)   "Existing mobile home park or mobile home subdivision" means a parcel
(or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more mobile home lots for
rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on
which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads and the construction of streets), was completed before the effective date
of this chapter (Ordinance 275, passed August 30, 1978).
   (g)   "Expansion to an existing mobile home park or mobile home subdivision"
means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the mobile homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads and the construction of streets).
   (h)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (k)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   (l)   "Habitable floor" means any floor used for living purposes, which
includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination
thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a "habitable floor."

sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without
a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. "Mobile home"
does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
   (n)   "New construction" means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter
(Ordinance 275, passed August 30, 1978).
   (o)   "New mobile home park or mobile home subdivision" means a parcel (or
contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more mobile home lots for rent
or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on which
the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of
utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads and the
construction of streets) is completed on or after the effective date of this
chapter (Ordinance 275, passed August 30, 1978).
   (p)   "Start of construction" means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the
pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the state of excavation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; the installation of streets and/or walkways; the
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; or the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not a part of the
main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement
or poured footings, "start of construction" includes the first permanent
framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or
foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home
subdivision, "start of construction" means the affixing of the mobile home to
its permanent site. For mobile homes within a mobile home park or mobile home
subdivision, "start of construction" is the date on which the construction of
facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads and the installation of utilities) is
completed.
   (q)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, mobile home or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (r)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is
started, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not such alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. "Substantial improvement" does not include any
project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local
health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to
ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
   (s)   "Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of
this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.

watercourse, so that the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. The Director shall make
interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of
the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section
1464.14.
(Ord. 275.  Passed 8-30-78.)
1464.14  APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   (a)   Procedures.
      (1)   Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there
is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Director
of Inspections in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Persons aggrieved by a decision of Council, or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided by statute.
      (4)   In passing upon applications, Council shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
this chapter and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property, in times of flood, for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (a)(4)
hereof, and the purposes of this chapter, Council may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
      (6)   The Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information,  and report any variance to the Federal
Insurance Administration upon request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, a variance may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   A variance may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
      (3)   A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   A variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   A variance shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, as identified in paragraph (a)(4) hereof; or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 275.  Passed 8-30-78.)

1479.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to help protect the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens by preventing blight, protecting property values and
neighborhood integrity, avoiding the creation and maintenance of nuisances and
ensuring the safe and sanitary maintenance of dwellings, commercial and
industrial buildings. Due to economic conditions, mortgage foreclosures, and
increased bankruptcies, many homes and buildings have become vacant and
unsupervised. This has caused or may in the future cause properties to become
attractive nuisances for minors and/or criminal activity. Vacant properties
have a negative impact on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. Potential
buyers are or may be deferred by the presence of nearby vacant abandoned
buildings. There is or may be an increased instance of unsecured or open doors
and windows, broken water pipes, flooded basements, theft of metals and other
materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs, and bushes, illegal dumping, and
rat and vermin activity at vacant structures. Such neglect devalues properties
and causes deterioration in neighborhoods and industrial and commercial areas.
The City also needs to be able to contact owners for utility shut- off, fire
safety and police reasons.
