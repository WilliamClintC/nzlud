Preface
The City Code of the City of North Branch, Minnesota
The City Code comprises three core elements:
? A CODE SYSTEM which provides structure to the Legislation
? The LEGISLATION itself (passed by Ordinance, or Resolution in specific cases)
? The LEGISLATIVE HISTORY of the Legislation
To provide order to legislation, Ordinances contains specific instructions wherein new legislation should
be placed within the City Code.
(a) CODE SYSTEM: The City Code is organized by section (often written as "Sec"), which are
placed among 3 organizational levels: CHAPTERS, ARTICLES, and DIVISIONS.
1. The first organizational level is CHAPTER.
2. The second organizational level is ARTICLE.
3. The last organizational level is DIVISION.
(b) LEGISLATION: Legislation is passed by Ordinance. The City Code may contain an unordered list
(using bullets, discs, squares, etc.), or an alphanumeric list, arranged to show hierarchical
relationships. Alphanumeric list styles vary, but the North Branch City Code is divided into the
following style, "(a), (1), a., 1., i.”, five list items deep. References to a "Subsection" within any
SECTION, often refers to a particular alphanumeric line item.
(c) LEGISLATIVE HISTORY: In this online code, the history of a particular legislation can be found
at its base. The completely italicized text area displays:
1. The original document type (Ord., Res. Art., Map)
a. Ord. signifies Ordinance
b. Res. signifies Resolution
c. Art. signifies Article
d. Map signifies Map
2. The document name relevant to the displayed legislation (an underlined name signifies a
link is available for view/download).
3. The Legislative Action that occurred (“Adopted by”, “Amended by”, etc.)
4. The date in which the legislative action took place.
5. If additional copy resides within the legislation, they are additional notes added by an
administrator of the online code.
Vacant chapters, sections, or subsections may be designed for future use and may be marked
“Reserved” to ease internal expansion. The legislative history written as footnotes at the bottom of
legislative text identifies specific legal sources. These sources contain documents which may or may not
be linked.

the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of this Code and
the application thereof to other persons shall not be affected thereby.

and no fine, forfeiture or penalty incurred before any ordinance or part thereof is repealed by this

conviction and punishment for any such offense, and the recovery of fines, forfeitures and
penalties, shall be had in all respects as if the repealed provisions had been maintained in force.

misdemeanor, or whenever in this Code the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is

such provision of this Code shall be a misdemeanor punishable to the maximum extent authorized in

Sec 2-201 Planning Agency Preamble
The North Branch City Council adopted its 2009 Comprehensive Plan to serve as its statements of
policies, goals, standards, land use plan, community facilities plan, transportation plan, and
recommendations for plan execution. The Comprehensive Plan, as amended from time to time, is a
statement of what the community of North Branch wants to become. It is a set of goals and policies
designed to achieve a community wise "vision" that is based upon a series of community defined
"guiding principles". The plan is based on a composition of concepts, patterns and relationships that deal
with integrating the social aspects of a community with its physical development. Unlike the zoning
ordinance, the comprehensive plan is futuristic in that it guides decisions that have yet to be made. The
word "comprehensive" in itself provides meaning to the plan; it deals with the whole community and not
just the parts.
The 2009 Comprehensive Plan is a broad based-planning tool. The process of developing the
Comprehensive Plan engaged elected officials, citizens, and city staff in a dialogue about the future of
their community. The result of the dialogue was consensus on how North Branch should look in the
future. The 2009 Comprehensive Plan documents this consensus and provides guidelines for achieving
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_2_ADMINISTRATION 10/23
the goals of the community. Most importantly, it is the official guide for development over the next two
decades in North Branch and serves to inform planning, zoning and economic development and growth.

Sec 2-202 Planning Agency Purpose
The North Branch Community Development Department is hereby designated as the Planning Agency
for the City pursuant to Minnesota Statutes section 462.354, subdivision I (as may be amended) and
shall serve to advise and recommend actions for official approval by the City Council. The Community
Development Department shall thus have the authority to take all actions of a Planning Agency,
including: reviewing amendments to the comprehensive plan (Minn. Stat. § 462.355, subd. 3), reviewing
the purchase and sale of public property and capital improvement projects (Minn. Stat. § 462.356,
subd. 2), reviewing zoning ordinance amendments (Minn. Stat. § 462 .357, subd. 4), maintaining official
maps (Minn. Stat. § 462.359), reviewing use permits, plats, lot splits, subdivisions(Minn. Stat. §
462.358), and any and all other duties of a Planning Agency. Responsibility for managing and directing
the duties and responsibilities of the Planning Agency shall be vested in the City's Planning Director.
The Community Development Director is designated as the city's Planning Director and is therefore
responsible for the duties and functions set forth in City Code Section 66-42. Further, the duties and
responsibilities of the Planning Director and Planning Agency shall be supported by a Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission shall assist the Planning Agency and shall perform such
functions as are deemed necessary or advisable by the Planning Director or City Council, and may
include, by way of example, conducting public hearings (including the review of applications, analysis of
testimony and review and recommendations for proposed findings of fact and conditions for approval),
hosting public input sessions, and reviewing and recommending to the Planning Agency changes and
amendments to the city's then existing comprehensive plan, ordinances and zoning code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Council shall act as the board of appeals and adjustment
(Minn. Stat. § 462.354, subd. 2) to and shall have the power to: review all appeals from the ruling of an
administrative officer where an error in any regulation, decision or determination made by such officer in
enforcing the zoning ordinance, or subdivision regulations, is alleged.

Sec 18-240 Purpose
The purpose of this article of the City Code is to prohibit massage businesses and services to the public
except those licensed as therapeutic massage business and massage therapists pursuant to this section.
The licensing regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to protect businesses that are operating
legitimate enterprises, to prevent criminal activity and to protect the health and welfare of the community.
The purpose of this section is not to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of protected speech or
expression.
(Ord. No. 225-15, § 1(Exh. A), 5-12-2015)
Sec 18-241 Findings Of The City Council
The City Council of the City of North Branch makes the following findings regarding the need to license
therapeutic massage businesses and therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and
services to the public:
(a) Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and hygiene
can provide a legitimate and necessary service to the general public.
(b) Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage businesses and therapists can
minimize the risk of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health and
sanitation.
(c) License qualifications for the restrictions on therapeutic massage businesses and therapists can
minimize the risk that such businesses and persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal
activity in the community.
(d) Massage services provided by persons with no specialized and standardized training in massage can
endanger citizens by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to
unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, and by increasing the risk of personal injury.
(e) Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized training can tax
city law enforcement services because such businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for
prostitution and other criminal activity than operations established by persons with standardized
training.
(f) The training of professional massage therapists at accredited institutions is an important means of
ensuring the fullest measure of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

privately-owned property.

by:
a. Abating the nuisance as a public improvement under Minn. Stats. ch. 429; or
b. Abating the nuisance as provided in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
2. If the forester finds that danger of infestation of other trees is imminent, he shall notify the
abutting property owner by certified mail that the nuisance shall be abated within a specified
time, not less than five days from the date of mailing of such notice. The forester shall
immediately report such action to the city council, and after the expiration of the time limited
by the notice he may abate the nuisance.
(b) Upon receipt of the forester's report required by subsection (a)(1) of this section, the city council shall
by resolution order the nuisance abated. Before action is taken on such resolution, the city council
shall publish notice of its intention to meet to consider taking action to abate the nuisance. This notice
shall be mailed to affected property owners and published once no less than one week prior to such
meeting. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, the streets affected, action
proposed, the estimated cost of abatement, and the proposed basis of assessment, if any, of costs.
At such hearing or adjournment thereof, the city council shall hear property owners with reference to
the scope and desirability of the proposed project. The city council shall thereafter adopt a resolution
confirming the original resolution with such modifications as it considers desirable and provide for the
doing of work by day labor or by contract.

shows that the person was engaging in and planning to continue engaging in, lawful activity
consistent with his actions and all the circumstances surrounding his behavior.
(d) Requisites for conviction. A person may not be convicted of a violation of section 42-202 if:

To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its streets and
the appropriate use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair
and free from unnecessary encumbrances.
Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code relating to right-of-way permits and
administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of
facilities and equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is
intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons
excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
chapter provides for recovery of out-of pocket and projected costs from persons using the public rightsof-
way.
This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123, substantially
codified in Minn. Stat. §§237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the "Act") and 2017
Session Laws, Chapter 94 amending the Act and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city
and users of the right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minnesota Rules
7819.0050 - 7819.9950 and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560 where possible. To the extent any provision
of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most
consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be
interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
To the extent that a franchise agreement is in full force and effect whereby the city and an Applicant are
the parties thereto, to the extent that the terms and conditions of this Chapter conflict with the terms and
conditions of the franchise agreement, the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement shall control.

disapproved by the city council after a public hearing following public notice.
(Code 1996, § 16.32.010)
Sec 54-179 Public Purpose
Regulations of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable police power are delegated by
the state to this municipality. The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions laid
down by the planning commission for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land to
conform to the physical and economic development of the municipality and to the health, safety, and
general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large. The procedures
for an amendment follow the procedures set forth in section 54-180 for variances.
(Code 1996, § 16.32.020)
Sec 54-180 Procedure For Variances
(a) When the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may
result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations may
be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may recommend the city council
approve variances, exceptions and waiver of conditions to these subdivision regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that the variance,
exception, or waiver of conditions shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations; and further provided the planning commission shall not recommend the city
council approve variances, exceptions, and waiver of conditions unless it shall make findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
1. The granting of the variance, exception or waiver of conditions will not be detrimental to
the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;
2. The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the property for which the
relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other property;
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_54_SUBDIVISIONS 19/40
3. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried
out;
4. The relief sought will not in any manner affect the provisions of the zoning chapter,
comprehensive plan, or zoning map, except that those documents may be amended in
the manner prescribed by law.
(b) In approving variances, exceptions, or waivers of conditions, the city council may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the purposes described in section 54-5. In
recommending any variance, the planning commission shall prescribe only conditions that it
deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its recommendations, the
planning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed land use and the existing
use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision,
and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity.
(c) A petition for variance, exception or waiver of conditions shall be filed with the zoning
administrator or city planner on an official application form by the subdivider at the time when the
preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the planning commission. The petition shall state
fully the grounds for the application and the facts relied upon by the petitioner. Such application
shall be accompanied by complimentary copies of detailed written and graphic materials fully
explaining the proposed change, development, or use. The zoning administrator or city planner
shall refer the application, along with all related information, to the planning commission for
consideration and a report at least 15 days before the next regular meeting.
(d) The zoning administrator or city planner, on behalf of the planning commission, shall set a date
for a public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the
municipality at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. In the requests for variances, such
notice shall also be mailed in not less than ten days to all property owners of records within 350
feet of the property to which the request relates; and if the variance relates to land located in the
S shoreland district or the FP floodplain district, the notice shall also be mailed to the
commissioner of the department of natural resources at least ten days prior to such hearings. A
copy of the notice and a list of the property owners and addresses to which the notice was sent
shall be attested to by the zoning administrator or city planner and made a part of the official
record. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners, or defects in the notice
shall not invalidate the proceedings, provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this subdivision
has been made.
(e) The planning commission shall consider the request and hold a public hearing at its next regular
meeting unless the filing date falls within 15 days of the meeting, in which case the request would
be placed on the agenda and considered at the following next regular meeting. The city planner
shall refer the application, along with all related information, to the planning commission for

(f) In requests for variances, the planning commission may recommend a variance from the
provisions of this chapter when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance.
In recommending any variance, the planning commission shall prescribe only conditions that it
deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its recommendations, the
planning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the
existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed
subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the
vicinity. A variance shall only be recommended when the planning commission finds:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property such that the
strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of his land;
2. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
to other property in the territory in which property is situated;
3. That the variance is to correct inequities resulting from an extreme physical hardship such
as topography, soils, wetlands, etc.
(g) Within 60 days from the date of the public hearing, the planning commission shall make a
recommendation, and in requests for variances shall also make a finding of fact to the city
council.

recommendations shall be entered in and made part of the permanent written record of the city
council meeting.
(i) Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission, the city council shall either:
1. Approve or disapprove the request as recommended by the planning commission;

modifications, alterations, or differing conditions. Such modifications, alterations, or
differing conditions shall be in writing and made part of the city council's records; or

floodplain district shall be mailed to the commissioner of the department of natural resources
within ten days of the decision.

Whenever within one year after granting a variance the work as permitted by the variance shall not have
been completed, then such variance shall become null and void unless a petition for extension of time in
which to complete the work has been granted by the city council. Such extension shall be requested in
writing and filed with the zoning administrator or city planner at least 30 days before the expiration of the
original variance. There shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The request for extension shall
state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete the work permitted by the variance. Such petition

Sec 54-464 Generally
(a) Authority. Pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 462.358, as amended, the city council may require
subdividers requesting platting or replatting of land or a planned unit development within the
jurisdictional boundaries of the ordinance to contribute a percent of the final gross area of the
subdivision to be dedicated to the city for public use for parks, playgrounds or public open space;
or that the subdivider contribute an equivalent amount in cash based upon an amount
established by the city council at the time of final plat approval; or any combination thereof. The
form of contribution (cash, land or any combination) shall be determined based upon the
following conditions outlined below.
(b) Residential subdivisions. In residential subdivisions the subdivider shall dedicate ten percent of
the undeveloped land proposed to be subdivided for purposes outlined in subsection (a) of this
section; or a park dedication fee per lot for each new lot created in the proposed subdivision at a
rate set by the city council in its current fee schedule; or any combination thereof. If there is more
than one residential unit per lot, the fee shall be per unit, not per lot. Such contribution shall be
based upon a finding of fact as outlined in subsection (a) of this section. Residential lot splits are
considered a form of subdividing land because a new lot is created; therefore, lot splits have park
dedication requirements.
(Code 1996, § 16.24.010(A), (B))
Sec 54-465 Conditions For Contributions
It shall be deemed to be in the public interest to require land dedication, cash contribution, or any
combination thereof when the city council after review and recommendation makes one or more of the
following findings of fact:
(a) All or part of the proposed subdivision has been designated as park, playground, public open
space, storm sewer holding areas or ponds on an adopted city plan;
(b) Such contribution is necessary in order to protect adjacent land uses from potential conflicting
land uses which could exist on the land subdivided;
(c) The increased number of residents to reside or be employed within the subdivision will increase
the recreational demands upon the city;

(d) The land proposed to be subdivided contains or borders upon existing unique topographical
features including but not limited to ponds, lakes, streams, timber stands, water holding areas,
hills, steep slopes, drainage areas, or bluffs which should be preserved to prevent foreseeable
safety, pollution, or erosion hazards or to provide unique recreational and aesthetic qualities and
enjoyment to the city;
Such contribution is necessary to comply with or fulfill the goals, policies, and programs of the
city.
(Code 1996, § 16.24.010(C))
Sec 54-466 Exceptions For Outlots
In subdivisions which include outlots for future development or outlots within a subdivision that are
designed specifically for other purposes, the subdivider shall contribute land, cash, or any combination
thereof as provided in this article and the following criteria:
(a) For land contributions, the entire subdivision, including the land within the outlots will be included
in the determination of the total land dedication percentage.
(b) When deemed necessary by the city for cash contributions only that land exclusive of the outlots
will be included in the determination. When such outlots are subdivided, the cash contribution
requirement shall be met in accordance with then existing regulations as applicable, unless such
contributions have been previously met.
(Code 1996, § 16.24.020)
Sec 54-467 Special Fund
All moneys collected from cash contributions shall be placed in a special fund from which only those
public uses outlined in section 54-464 and section 54-465 of this chapter may be realized.

a PUD in accordance with City Code Sec. 66-791.
(b) Existing principal structures within the Urban Service Area must connect to Municipal Utilities, at the
owner’s sole cost and expense, no later than 2 years from the date that such Municipal Utilities are
available. For purposes of this section, the term “available”is generally defined to mean such time as
when water supply lines and/or sewer lines (to which connections can be made) are installed in a city
street, alley, easement or public right of way within 100 feet of the property line and operational.

consideration will be given to geographic barriers to making the connection to an individual dwelling
unit, the need for easements or other access to extend the connection to additional dwelling units,
distance from the dwelling unit to the nearest available connection point,and whether individual
grinder pumps or lift stations are needed to connect a dwelling unit to the nearest connection. If the
distance from the nearest connection point to the dwelling unit is more than 400 feet, in the absence
of other compelling factors, the Municipal Utility will not be considered “available” to that dwelling unit.
Written notice of availability will be provided to property owners and the date of such notice will
establish the start date for the 2 year period of time to connect. If no threat to health,safety or welfare
exists and the existing well and/or septic system is in full compliance with applicable city, county and
state code as evidenced by a Certificate of Compliance,the required connections can be deferred, at
the property owner’s option, for the term of the Certificate of Compliance and any subsequent
renewals of the Certificate of Compliance, up to a maximum of 15 years from the date on which the
initial Certificate of Compliance is issued provided that the existing septic system and well remain in
compliance with applicable city, county and state code. If any well or septic system is deemed a
threat to health and safety or poses the threat of contamination to ground water or is generally
deemed non-compliant, the existing structure must connect to available Municipal Utilities within 60
days of the date on which the city’s Building Official deems such threat to exist.
(c) In addition to the remedies set forth in Sec. 58-77, if connections are not made as required by this
section, service charges will be billed to the owner as if the structure was connected to Municipal
Utilities, based on an estimate of usage as determined by the size of the structure. The City will be
entitled to the remedies related to non-payment of the billed costs as set forth in City Code Sections
58-283 to 58-285.
(d) Once the structure is attached to city sewer, the existing septic system must be abandoned and
decommissioned as provided in City Code Chapter 14. Once the structure is attached to municipal
water service, the structure must be disconnected from the well. The owner can still utilize the well as
a water source for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation and lawn uses.

(d) There shall be two classes of sewer permits:
1. Residential and commercial service;
2. Industrial service.
In the case of industrial services; the industry, as a condition of the permit authorization, must
provide information describing the wastewater constituents, characteristics and type of
activity.
(e) All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the sewer service shall be borne
by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
(f) A separate and independent sewer line shall be provided for every building or separate part of a
building in the case of a twin home, townhouse or similar structure, except where one building stands
at the rear of another or on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to
the rear of the building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway. The sewer from the front
building may be extended to the new building and the whole considered one building sewer. The city
does not and will not assume any obligation or responsibility for sewers constructed and used in this
manner. Permit applications for connection through an existing sewer must be accompanied by an
authorization from the property owner through which the sewer will be connected.
(g) An existing service may only be utilized for a new connection if it can be demonstrated that the
existing service meets current city standards and is demonstrated to be in serviceable condition and
will meet the sanitary sewer service requirements of the new structure. This determination shall be
made by the city public works director and the city building official.
(h) The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used
in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the state of Minnesota state building and plumbing code and rules and regulations of
the city. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures
set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials, State Plumbing
Code, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. In all instances of
connections to the sewer main, a manufactured wye service connection shall be used and installed
using adaptors as required to provide a watertight sound connection to prevent leakage of I/I into the
main.
(i) Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the
basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the
public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means
and discharged to the building sewer.
(j) No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains,
surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or indirectly to the wastewater disposal system.
(k) The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the
state of Minnesota state building and plumbing code and applicable rules and regulations of the city
or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM WPCF Manual of Practice No.
9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight, and verified by proper testing to
prevent the inclusion of infiltration/inflow. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials
must be approved by the city prior to installation.

(l) The applicant for a building sewer shall notify the city when the building sewer is ready for inspection
and connection to the public sewer. The connection and inspection shall be made under the
supervision of the building official or authorized representative thereof. The sewer connections shall
be accomplished Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Any work
accomplished outside of this schedule will require a fee for the entire cost of an employee to inspect
the process. Failure to receive inspection will result in a $100.00 penalty and may require a dig up of
the installation to prove satisfactory connection.
(m) All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights
so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property
disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. The cost of
the restoration shall be borne by the applicant.
(n) Sewer connection permits will be issued with the issuance of building permits for all new homes. If
the installation of a sewer connection involves an excavation of a public street, alley, way or property
it is the responsibility of the licensed sewer connection installer to see that a sewer permit has been
issued and apply for and receive an excavation permit for a service connection to a public sewer.
Failure to have the required permits will result in double permit fees.
(o) A sewer line tracer wire will be ten-gauge solid insulated copper wire, the insulated color is to be
green. The wire is to be attached and wrapped around the sewer service line from the sewer service
collection point or from the main to the structure where applicable. The wire will then be attached to
the structure directly above the sewer service line at the top course of the concrete block by means of
a stainless steel eyelet attached to the structure. Grease caps are to be installed at each end of the
wire to prevent corrosion, a minimum of eight inches of wire must be tied to the anchor at the
structure. For sewer service line replacement the tracer wire shall be installed from the sewer main
back to the structure in the same fashion.

(d) The following described substances, materials, water, or wastes shall be limited in discharges to
municipal systems to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either sewers, the wastewater
treatment works treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream and/or soil, vegetation and ground water, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public
property, or constitute a nuisance. The public works director may set limitations lower than limitations
established in the regulations below if, in his opinion, such more severe limitations are necessary to
meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of wastes, the public works
director will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in reaction to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment
process, the city's NPDES and/or SDS permit, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of
treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or
restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer
which shall not be violated without approval of the public works director are as follows:

they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation at the expense of the
owner(s).
(h) Grease, oil and sand interceptors or extra septic tanks shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
public works director they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable
grease in excessive amounts as specified in subsection (d)(2) of this section, any flammable wastes,
as specified in subsection (c)(1) of this section, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be
to the type to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal of the captured
materials by appropriate means, and shall maintain a record of dates and means of disposal which
are subject to review by the public works director. Any removal and hauling of the collecting materials
not performed by the owner's personnel, must be performed by a currently licensed waste disposal
firm.
(i) Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial
wastes shall install a suitable structure, or control manhole with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes.
Such structure shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
the plans approved by the city. The structure shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall
be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(j) The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes at the discretion of
the city is required to provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analysis of waters and wastes to
illustrate compliance with this division and any special conditions for discharge established by the city
or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type and frequency of
sampling and laboratory analysis to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city. The
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure
that compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the
results of measurements and laboratory analysis to the city at such times, and in such manner as
prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analysis and reporting
required by the city. At such times deemed necessary, the city reserves the right to take
measurements and samples for analysis by an independent laboratory.
(k) All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference
is made in this division shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of standard methods
for the examination of water and wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association.
Sampling methods, location, times, duration and frequencies are to be determined on an individual
basis subject to approval by the public works director.
(l) Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a sanitary sewer shall provide
protection from an accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
division. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the public works director for review and
approval prior to construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this division. Users shall notify the public works director immediately
upon having a slug or accidental discharge of substances of wastewater in violation of this division to
enable countermeasures to be taken by the public works director to minimize damage to the
wastewater treatment works. Such notification will not relieve any user of any liability for any
expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or treatment process, or for any fines
imposed on the city on account thereof under any state and federal law. Employers shall insure that
all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.

(m) No person, having charge of any building or other premises which drains into the public sewer, shall
permit any substance or matter which may form a deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the
public sewer. Within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the city the owner shall install a
suitable and sufficient catch basin or waste trap, or if one already exists, shall clean out, repair or
alter the same, and perform such other work, as the public works director may deem necessary.
Upon the owner's refusal or neglect to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair or
alter the same after the period of 90 days, the public works director may cause such work to be
completed at the expense of the owner or representative thereof.
(n) Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed, broken or out of order, or
detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for the purposes of drainage, the owner shall repair
or cause such work to be done as the public works director may direct. Each day after 30 days that a
person neglects or fails to so act shall constitute a separate violation of this section, and the public
works director may then cause the work to be done, and recover from such owner or agent the
expense thereof by an action in the name of the city.
(o) The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing facility shall provide and maintain in
serviceable condition at all times, a catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent
grease, oil, dirt or mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.
(p) In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any provision of this division, the city
may assess against any person the cost of repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities
damaged as a result of the discharge of prohibited wastes by such person, and may collect such
assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public sewer system or in any other manner
deemed appropriate by the city.
(q) No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern, providing that National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and/or state disposal
system permit limitations are not violated.

relationship to the design flow capacity of the WWTF. This relationship, expressed as a
percentage, shall be applied to the total cost of construction of the WWTF as the sewer
availability charge to be applied for hookup. If the flow is other than normal domestic strength
waste said calculation shall be adjusted to deal with the increased demand placed on the
facility not reflected by a flow calculation alone;
5. The computation for new building units shall include a deduction for demolition of an existing
building unit if available.
(e) If a building permit is required for remodeling for changes of use for existing structures, a SAC fee will
be imposed to the greater use giving credit for past use as part of the SAC fee.

Sec 58-128 User Fees; Purpose
It is the purpose of this division to provide for the recovery of cost from users of the city's sewer utility for the
implementation of the program established herein and to maintain a system of charges by which each user
will pay for the costs associated with the amount of wastewater collection and treatment services received by
the user. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the city's schedule of charges and fees, to be
prepared, annually, by the city administrator and approved by the city council.
(Code 1996, § 13.16.130)
Sec 58-129 Charge And Fees; Outlined
The city council shall adopt annually user charges which may include:
(a) Rates for residential users of the sewer utility. These charges shall be assessed based upon metered
water usage;
(b) Rates for commercial, governmental and institutional users of the sewer utility. These charges shall
be assessed based upon equivalent residential units or upon a city approved metering of the user's
private water supply;
(c) Rates for industrial users of the sewer utility. There are no industries in the community known to
discharge wastes in excess of the stipulated volumetric, biological or suspended solids loading rates.
Therefore, these charges will not be assessed at present. Should an industry choose to locate in the
community and discharge wastes to the sewer utility, an industrial rate schedule will be developed
based upon equivalent residential units as identified by section 58-120.

Sec 58-130 Revenue Gathered By User Charges; Separate Accounts
(a) All revenue gathered by the user charges shall be maintained in an account separate from other
municipal accounts, and shall be used solely to defray the cost of operation, maintenance and
replacement of the sewer utility. Revenue sufficient to insure adequate replacement shall be held in a
replacement fund separate from other operation and maintenance revenues.
(b) Interest generated by the replacement fund shall remain in the replacement fund.
(c) Revenue from the sewer fund shall be used to retire the debt of the WWTF. The sewer availability
charge funds can also be used to help retire the debt if the city so chooses. Sewer user fees for debt
retirement shall be kept in the sewer fund for making debt payments on the construction of the
WWTF.
(Code 1996, § 13.16.150)
Sec 58-131 Wastewater Service Charges; General Provisions
(a) Service charges. The wastewater service charges for the use of and service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the city shall be set and adjusted from time to time by ordinance of the city
council. This may be accomplished after an audit of the operating costs and revenues concerning the
operation of the WWFT.
(b) Bills.
1. The rates or charges for service shall be payable monthly. All properties connected to the
municipal sewer system will be charged a based fee, regardless of usage.
2. The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service shall be jointly
liable to pay for the service to such premises and the service is finished to the premises by
the city only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant, and user of the
services are jointly liable therefor to the city.
3. Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the water and light department on the last day of
each month for which the service is billed.
4. All sewer bills are due and payable 15 days after being sent out. A penalty of ten percent shall
be added to all bills not paid 15 days after they have been rendered. The penalty fee shall be
applied to the amount overdue only once, and the fees shall not compound.
(c) Delinquent bills. If the charges for such services are not paid within 30 days after the rendition of the
bill for such services, such services may be discontinued without further notice and shall not be
reinstated until all claims are settled.
(d) Lien; notice of delinquency.
1. Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for 90 days after it has been rendered, the
city shall file with the county recorder a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain
the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that
the city claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the period
covered by the bill.
2. If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the city has notice of this,
notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his address be known to the city,
whenever such bill remains unpaid for the period of 90 days after it has been rendered.
3. The failure of the city to record such lien or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to
receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned
in the foregoing section.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_58_UTILITIES 36/54
(e) Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the
same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosures shall be by bill-in-equity in the name
of the city. The city's attorney is authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of
the city in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has
remained unpaid 180 days after it has been rendered.
(f) Revenues. All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewerage system shall be
deposited in the sewerage account of the sewerage fund. All such revenues and moneys shall be
held by the city separate and apart from their private funds and separate and apart from all other
funds of the city. The city shall receive all such revenues from the sewerage system and all other
funds and moneys incident to the operation of such system as the same may be delivered to them
and deposit the same in the amount of the fund designated as the sewerage fund. The fund shall be
administered in every respect in the manner provided by state statute.
(g) Accounts. The city shall establish a proper system of accounts and shall keep proper books, records,
and accounts in which complete and correct entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the
sewerage system, and at regular annual intervals shall cause to be made an audit by an independent
auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and disbursements of the sewerage system.
(h) Penalty. Any person, firm or corporation violating any provisions of this division shall be fined not less
than $50.00 nor more than $100.00 for each offense.

access to any books, documents, papers and records of the city which are applicable to the city
system of service charges for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts and transactions
thereof to insure compliance with the terms of the special and general conditions to any state grant.
(j) Sanitary sewer disconnect—User/Owner sanitary sewer disconnect/shut off request. The owner or
his/her authorized agent may request that his/her sanitary sewer be shut off from accumulating
additional sewer charges other than the base sewer connect fee as outlined in the city's fee
schedule. This request will need to be made in writing to the city's public works director stating the
reason for such request along with a copy of the letter that was given to the water department
requesting the water be shut off. The minimum monthly sewer fee will be discontinued only after the
property owner has provided a written request for the sewer to be physically disconnected from the
city's sanitary sewer main. The following sewer disconnect procedure must be utilized when
disconnecting service from the sanitary sewer main:
1. Owner must submit a letter stating reason for the disconnect.

period at two percent over the city's average rate of return for the previous year unless the
rate exceeds the bank's prime lending rate as determined by the city's official depository bank
in which case the rate should be set at one percent below prime as long as the resulting rate
is above the most recent bonding for SAC/WAC and trunk projects.
An irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of 125% of the outstanding balance shall be
posted and remain in effect until all outstanding fees have been paid.

Sec 58-215 Findings And Determinations
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_58_UTILITIES 40/54
(a) In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a stormwater
drainage system (the storm sewer system) consisting of certain storm sewer facilities. This division of
the Code is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purposes.
(b) The city has previously financed the cost of constructing, operating and maintaining the storm sewer
system by creating special storm sewer tax districts, and levying ad valorem taxes upon property
located in the storm sewer tax districts. The city has determined that it is now necessary and
desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the costs of improving,
maintaining and operating the storm sewerage system by imposing just and reasonable charges for
the use and availability of the storm sewerage system (the storm sewerage system fee) as provided
in this division.
(c) Pursuant to state law, the city finds that it is necessary to establish the storm sewerage system fee in
a just and equitable manner. On the basis of a report prepared by the city engineer dated June 1992
(the engineer's report) and subsequent reports which analyzed the status of the completion of the
storm sewerage system, past methods of recovering storm sewerage system costs, the topography
of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign
responsibility for some or all of the costs of operating, maintaining and improving the storm sewerage
system on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city
during a standard rainfall event. For the purposes of this division, a standard rainfall event is defined
as a rainfall event with a return frequency of ten years.
(d) On the basis of the engineer's report, the city finds that it would be appropriate to exempt from the
storm sewer fee lakes and landlocked basins. Lakes and landlocked basins receive little, if any,
benefit from the storm sewerage system.
(Ord. No. 123-08, § 1, 9-29-2008)
Sec 58-216 Rates And Charges
(a) Residential equivalent factor (REF). The storm sewage system fee shall be determined through the
use of a residential equivalent factor (REF). For the purposes of this section, one REF is defined as
the ratio of the average volume of surface stormwater runoff coming from one acre of land in a

(b) Stormwater drainage system charges. In determining the storm sewage system fee, the city council
shall establish a basic system rate to be charged a residential lot having a residential equivalent
factor (REF) of one. The basis of determining a REF will be a residential lot, and the average
residential lot is estimated to be one-fourth acre. The charge to be made against each parcel of land
shall then be determined by multiplying the REF for that parcel's land use classification times that
parcel's acreage times the basic system rate. The REFs for the following land uses within the city and
the billing classifications for such land uses are as follows:
Classification Land Uses Residential Equivalent Factor
1 Residential 1
2 Commercial/Industrial 4

Sec 58-254 Findings
The North Branch city council hereby finds that uncontrolled and inadequately planned use of wetlands,
woodlands, natural habitat areas, areas subject to soil erosion and areas containing restrictive soil adversely
affects the public health, safety, and general welfare by impacting water quality and contributing to other
environmental problems, creating nuisances, impairing other beneficial uses or environmental resources and
hindering the ability of the city to provide adequate water, sewage, flood control, and other community
services. In addition, extraordinary public expenditures may be required for the protection of persons and
property in such areas and in areas which may be affected by unplanned land usage.
(Code 1996, § 13.18.020; Ord. No. 227-15, § 4, 5-26-2015)

The purpose of this division is to promote, preserve, and enhance the natural resources within the city and
protect them from adverse effects occasioned by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by
regulating land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible
impact on water quality and unique and fragile environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and
encouraging compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and encouraging compatibility
between land disturbing and development activities and water quality and environmentally sensitive land;

proposed for such areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development and
protection of water quality and natural areas.
(Code 1996, § 13.18.030)
Sec 58-256 Definitions
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Applicant means any person who wishes to obtain a building permit, zoning or subdivision approval.
Best management practices (BMPS) means the most effective and practicable means or erosion
prevention and sediment control, and water quality management practices that are the most effective
and practicable means to control, prevent and minimize degradation of surface water, including
avoidance of impacts, construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed,
prohibitions, pollution prevention through good housekeeping, and other management practices
published by state or designated area-wide planning agencies.
Construction activity means a disturbance to the land that results in a change in the topography, existing
soil cover (both vegetative and nonvegetative), or the existing soil topography that may result in
accelerated stormwater runoff, leading to soil erosion and movement of sediment into surface waters or
drainage systems.
Control measure is a practice or combination of practices to control erosion and attendant pollution.
Detention facility means a permanent natural or man-made structure, including wetlands, for the
temporary storage of runoff which contains a permanent pool of water.
Dewatering means the removal of water for construction activity. It can be a discharge of appropriated
surface or ground water to dry and/or solidify a construction site. It may require Minnesota Department
of Natural Resources permits to be appropriated and if contaminated may require other MPCA permits
to be discharged.
Erosion means any process that wears away the surface of the land by action of water.
Erosion control means methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization
practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or permanent cover and construction phasing.
Erosion prevention means any measures employed to prevent erosion. Examples include but are not
limited to: soil stabilization practices, limited grading, mulch, temporary or permanent cover and
construction phasing.
Final stabilization means:
(a) All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform (e.g., evenly disturb
without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent of the na
background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas
covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the us
riprap, gabions, or geotextiles) have been employed;

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_58_UTILITIES 44/54
(b) For individual lots in residential construction by either:
1. The homebuilder completing final stabilization as specified above; or
2. The homebuilder establishing temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for
individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and informing the homeow
of the need for, and benefits of, final stabilization (homeowners typically have an incentiv
put in the landscaping functionally equivalent to final stabilization as quick as possible to k
mud out of their homes and off sidewalks and driveways); or
(c) For construction project on land used for agricultural purposes (e.g., pipelines across crop or ra
land) final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruc
agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities, such
buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface waters and drainage systems, and areas which are
being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteri
subsection (1) or (2) of this definition.

(b) Shut-off for nonpayment. Utilities shall not be shut-off until notice and an opportunity for a preliminary
hearing before the general manager of the commission (the "initial hearing") and for an appeal
hearing before the commission (the "appeal hearing") has been provided to the occupant and owner
of the property involved as described below:
1. If any bill is not paid by the due date listed on the bill, a second bill will be mailed by first class
mail to the owner address provided when establishing the account and to the property
address, if different and shall contain a shut off notice ("shut off notice") stating that if payment

bill, utility service to the premises will be shut off for nonpayment.
2. The second bill and shut off notice shall contain the address and telephone number of the
general manager of the commission. This information shall be clearly visible and easily
readable.
3. The shut off notice shall also state that the owner and/or occupant has the right to an initial
hearing before the utility service is shut-off by requesting such hearing in writing within ten
days of receipt of the shut off notice. If the written initial hearing request is not received by the
commission within such time period, the owner and occupant shall have no further hearing or
appeal rights. If both the owner and the occupant request an initial hearing, both shall appear
at the same hearing. The owner and/or occupant may be represented at the initial hearing in
person and by counsel or any other person of his, her or its choosing. The owner and/or
occupant may present orally or in writing his, her or its position to the general manager of the
commission. The general manager shall be authorized to order continuation of the utility
service and shall have the authority to adjust the owner's bill or enter into a mutually
agreeable payment plan. The general manager shall notify the owner and/or occupant of his
or her decision in writing within five days of the initial hearing. If no written decision is issued,
the owner's and/or occupant's position shall be deemed denied as of the end of such fifth day.

received by the commission within ten days of the date the general manager issues his or her
decision. The commission shall review such facts and documents and conduct such appeal
hearing and in such manner as it shall determine to be appropriate to make a decision
regarding the owner's and/or occupant's appeal. The decision of the commission is final.
5. If the owner and/or occupant requests an initial hearing before the general manager or
subsequent appeal hearing before the commission within the required time period for each,
the utilities shall not be shut off until the hearing process is complete.
6. If the owner and/or occupant fails to pay a delinquent account, fails to request an initial
hearing or subsequent to the initial hearing fails to request an appeal hearing in the manner

(c) Certification for collection with taxes. Unpaid charges on utility accounts shall not be certified to the
county auditor until notice (the "certification notice") and an opportunity for the initial hearing before
the general manager of the commission has been provided to the owner of the property involved in
the manner provided herein. The certification notice may be combined with the shut off notice
referenced in (b) above and will be mailed by first class mail to the owner's address provided when
establishing the account and shall state that if payment is not made before the date for certification,
the entire amount unpaid plus penalties will be certified to the county auditor for collection as other
taxes are collected. The certification notice shall also state that the owner may, before such
certification date, request an appeal hearing on the matter to object to certification of unpaid utility
charges as provided below.
1. The owner of the property shall have the option of paying the balance due on the account
without penalty until the date the certification notice is mailed. After the date the certification
notice is mailed, payments will still be accepted but any penalties will be added to the amount
due on the account.
2. If the owner of the property requests an appeal hearing by written notice received by the
commission within ten days of the date of the certification notice, an appeal hearing shall be
held on the matter by the commission. The commission may schedule one or more dates and
times for appeal hearings by property owners who have appealed the certification notice in a
timely manner. At such appeal hearing, property owners who have appealed the certification
notice as and when provided herein, shall be afforded the opportunity to object to the
certification of unpaid charges to be collected as taxes are collected.
3. If a property owner fails to properly appeal a certification notice or if, after the appeal hearing
(subject to subsection (4) below), the commission finds that the amounts claimed as
delinquent are actually due and unpaid and that there is no legal reason why the unpaid
charges should not be certified for collection as other taxes are collected, the list of delinquent
utilities shall be forwarded to the city council. The city council, by resolution, at the first
regularly scheduled meeting after receipt of such list, shall consider the certification of such
delinquent utilities to be certified to the Chisago County Auditor.
4. For each certification sustained at an appeal hearing, the property owner shall have the
following options:
a. Within ten days of the appeal hearing date, to pay the delinquent amount listed on the
preliminary roll including interest and late charges, but without additional interest after
the appeal hearing date;
b. After such ten-day period, but before the certification of such amounts by the city
council, to pay the delinquent amount plus late charges and interest at the rate set in
the adopted rate schedule through the date of payment; or
c. After certification by the city council, to pay the certified amount as billed to them by
Chisago County on their property tax statement with a collection term of one year.
5. Fifteen days after adoption thereof by the city council, the certified roll of delinquent accounts,
minus any payments received with respect to any such account, shall be delivered to Chisago
County by the city clerk.

use permit in the zoning district in which the property is located without first obtaining an interim
use permit from the city. Where applicable, a building permit also must be obtained from the city.

environment or adjacent land uses. These studies may examine the impacts on such
things as traffic, environment, wetlands, and utilities.
(d) Procedure. The city will process an interim use application in accordance with the procedure for
conditional use permits in section 66-63. No application for an interim use permit that has been
denied wholly or in part may be resubmitted for a period of one year after the date of denial,
except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changes of conditions found to be valid by the city
council.
(e) General standards. The city will not grant an interim use permit unless the city council

(f) Effect of permit.
1. An interim use permit is effective only for the location specified in the application.

a. The expiration date in the interim use permit;
b. The occurrence of any event identified in the interim use permit for the termination
of the use;
c. The city council revoking the interim use permit for cause; or
d. The redevelopment of the use and property upon which the interim use permit is
located to a permitted or conditional use as allowed within the respective zoning
district.
2. An interim use permit expires one year after city council approval if the proposed use has
not started or if the city has not issued a building permit for a structure to support the
interim use. The city may approve one one-year administrative time extension for the
owner or operator to start using an interim use permit.
3. An interim use permit expires if the interim use ceases operation for a continuous period
of at least one year.
(h) Revocation or modification. The city council may review an interim use permit periodically and
may revoke a permit upon violation of any condition of the permit, any law of the United States or
the State of Minnesota or any city ordinance. If the city discovers after approval of the interim use
permit that the city's decision was based at least in part on false, misleading, or fraudulent
information, the city council may revoke the permit, modify the conditions or impose additional
conditions to ensure compliance with this section. The procedure for revocation of an interim use
permit will be the same as those specified in the City Code for the revocation of other city council
approved zoning and land use decisions.
(i) Amendment. Holders of an interim use permit may propose amendments or changes to an
approved permit by following the procedures for a new permit as set forth in the City Code. No
owner or operator shall undertake significant changes in the circumstances of the scope of the
permitted uses without the approval of the changes by the city council. The city shall determine
what constitutes a significant change. Significant changes include, but are not limited to,
expansion of structures and/or the premises and operational modification resulting in increased
external activities and traffic. The city council may approve significant changes and modifications
to interim use permits, including adding or changing conditions of approval.

A variance is a modification or variation of the provisions of this zoning code as applied to a
specific piece of property. Variances shall only be permitted:
1. When they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the ordinance; and
2. When the variances are consistent with the comprehensive plan. Variances may be
granted when the applicant for the variance establishes that there are practical difficulties
in complying with the zoning ordinance.
"Practical difficulties," as used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that:
a. The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not
permitted by the zoning ordinance;
b. The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner; and
c. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. Practical
difficulties include, but are not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for
solar energy systems.

13. Where structures combine residential and nonresidential uses, such uses shall be
separated and provided with individual outside access, and the uses shall not conflict in
any manner.
(b) All conditions pertaining to a specific request are subject to change when the planning
commission or city council, upon investigation, finds that the community safety, health, welfare
and public betterment can be served as well or better by modifying the conditions.

Sec 66-141 Structures Approved Prior To Effective Date
Any proposed structure which will, under this article, become nonconforming but for which a building
permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this section may be completed in

(a) Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes
Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(b) Findings of fact.
1. The flood hazard areas of the City of North Branch, Minnesota, are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a reasonable method
of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
3. National flood insurance program compliance. This chapter is adopted to comply with the
rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of
Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(c) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 66-697(b)(1) by provisions
contained herein.

(a) Lands to which ordinance applies. This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
the City of North Branch, Minnesota shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments
thereto as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain
districts.
(b) Establishment of official zoning map. The official zoning map together with all materials attached
thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The attached
material shall include the Flood Insurance Study, Chisago County, Minnesota And Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein numbered 27025C0145D, 27025C0163D,
27025C0165D, 27025C0170D, 27025C0250D, 27025C0255D and 27025C0260D, all documents
being dated April 17, 2012 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
official zoning map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk.
(c) Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an
elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
(d) Interpretation.
1. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be
minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and
shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
2. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and
there is a formal appeal of the decision of the zoning administrator, the board of
adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on
elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on
the site at the time the community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of
the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year
floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of
the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the
board of adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
(e) Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(f) Warning and disclaimer of liability. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain
districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of North Branch, Minnesota or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(g) Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall
not be affected thereby.

2. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained
in section 66-706(d) of this chapter.
3. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
4. Fill:
a. Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the
floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or
other acceptable method.
b. Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the
floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an
erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
c. As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (b) immediately above, dredge
spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site
storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage
of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the governing body has received an
appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway
based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be
title registered with the property in the office of the county recorder.

5. Accessory structures:
a. Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
b. Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
i. Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal
axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
ii. So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the
same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
c. Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in
accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to
the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code provided
the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500
square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the
detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage.
All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional
standards:
i. The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
ii. Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed;
and
iii. To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure.
Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
6. Storage of materials and equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from
the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a
plan approved by the governing body.
7. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of
protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. ch.
103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from
the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
8. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the
100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or
storage loss on both sides of a stream.

(Code 1996, § 17.30.040; Ord. No. 177-12, § 2, 3-12-2012)
Sec 66-701 Flood Fringe District (FF)
(a) Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses
in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist,
then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the flood fringe district provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All
permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe district "permitted uses" listed in
subsection (b) and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in subsection (e).
(b) Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest
floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The
finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory
flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond
the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
2. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal
investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be
internally floodproofed in accordance with section 66-700(d)(5)c.
3. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of 1,000 cubic yards of
fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is
specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this
section.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
5. The provisions of subsection (e) of this chapter shall apply.
(c) Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with
subsections (b)(1), (2) of this section or any use of land that does not comply with the standards
in subsections (b)(3), (4) of this section shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An
application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation
procedures specified in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and section 66-706(d).

(d) Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
1. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a
structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative
methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an
enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest
floor if:
a. The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure;
b. Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and
c. Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted
alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
i. Design and certification: The structure's design and as-built condition must
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in
compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code
and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of
flooding.
ii. Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas: Above-grade, fully
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(1) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is
to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the
bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above
grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer
or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves,
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human
intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials
in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking
of vehicles or storage.
2. Basements, as defined by section 66-8, shall be subject to the following:
a. Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
b. Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance
with subsection (3) of this section.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 137/215
3. All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the
structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the State Building
Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
4. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is
located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel
operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works,
an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is
enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state
approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood
event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or
other qualified individual acceptable to the governing body. The plan may incorporate
alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood
warning time exists.
5. Storage of materials and equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from
the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a
plan approved by the governing body.
6. The provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall also apply.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 138/215
(e) Standards for all flood fringe uses.
1. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more
than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this
requirement is granted, the board of adjustment must specify limitations on the period of
use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that
adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
2. Commercial uses: Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots
may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a
permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be
granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when
multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number
exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood.
3. Manufacturing and industrial uses: Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with
normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations.
Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations
subject to requirements set out in subsection (2) above. In considering permit
applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business
requires that it be located in floodplain areas.
4. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of
riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year
flood elevation—FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards
should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood
hazard area designation will be requested.
5. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel
and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a
floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map.
6. Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in section 66-705(c).
7. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.

(b) Procedures for 1% annual chance flood (100-year flood elevations) and/or floodway and flood
fringe determinations for streams located within the general floodplain district:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain
district, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is
deemed necessary by the zoning administrator for the determination of the regulatory
flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the floodway or flood
fringe district.
a. A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of
land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be
occupied by the proposed development, and high water information.
b. Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent
structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of
all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of
streets.
c. Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream,
and soil types.
d. Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for
at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development.
2. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a
designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in
determining the 1% annual chance flood (100-year flood elevations), if not available,
whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe district and to determine the
regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations
1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be
followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly
encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective
department of natural resources' area hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The
designated engineer or expert shall:
a. Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
b. Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic
analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
c. Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without
increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than .5 foot
shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood
damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the
stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.

3. The planning director shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated
engineer or expert to the governing body. The governing body must formally accept the
technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary
or deny the permit application. The governing body, prior to official action, may submit the
application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the department of natural resources or the planning commission for review and
comment. once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined,
the governing body shall refer the matter back to the zoning administrator who shall
process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 66-
700 and 66-701 of this chapter.
Zone A lakes: Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevations (100-year
flood elevations) for lakes located in Zone A:
a. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within a Zone A, the
zoning administrator will use the 1% annual chance flood elevation for that basin
that has previously been determined in accordance with approved FEMA
methods, if available. If the 1% annual chance flood elevation has not been
previously determined, the applicant shall be required to furnish all necessary
information as deemed necessary by the zoning administrator for the
determination for the 1% annual chance flood elevation in accordance with
approved FEMA methods.
b. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to
a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in
determining the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation).
Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000—
6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this
expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to
discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective
department of natural resources' area hydrologist prior to commencing the
analysis.
c. Once the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) has been
determined, the zoning administrator shall process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 66-700 and 66-701 of this
chapter depending on whether the use is in the floodway district or the flood fringe
district, respectively, as determined by the criteria in sections 66-699(a)(1) and (2)
of this chapter.

(a) Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply
systems to be located in the floodplain shall be floodproofed in accordance with the State
Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(b) Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the
floodplain shall comply with sections 66-700 and 66-701 of this chapter. Elevation to the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these
transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads
may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services
would not endanger the public health or safety.
(c) On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public utilities are not provided:
1. On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
flood waters into the systems; and
2. New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into
flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of

(c) Board of adjustment.
1. Rules. The board of adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of business and may
exercise all of the powers conferred on such boards by state law.
2. Administrative review. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an
administrative official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
3. Variances. The board of adjustment may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or
circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in the
respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as
appropriate. In the granting of such variance, the board of adjustment shall clearly identify
in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this
chapter, any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective enabling
legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance shall have the effect of
allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood
protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit
standards lower than those required by state law. The following additional variance
criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
a. Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
b. Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting
of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. Hearings. Upon filing with the board of adjustment of an appeal from a decision of the
zoning administrator, or an application for a variance, the board of adjustment shall fix a
reasonable time for a hearing and give due notice to the parties in interest as specified by
law. The board of adjustment shall submit by mail to the commissioner of natural
resources a copy of the application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that
the commissioner will receive at least ten days' notice of the hearing.

5. Decisions. The board of adjustment shall arrive at a decision on such appeal or variance
within 60 days. In passing upon an appeal, the board of adjustment may, so long as such
action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in
part, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination of the zoning
administrator or other public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance the board of
adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as those specified
in subsection (d)(6) of this section, which are in conformity with the purposes of this
chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter
punishable under section 66-708. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be
forwarded by mail to the commissioner of natural resources within ten days of such
action.
6. Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the board of adjustment may be made, and as
specified in this community's official controls and also by Minnesota Statutes.
7. Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The zoning administrator shall notify the
applicant for a variance that:
a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
$25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and
b. Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life
and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions. A community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or
biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance
Program.

uses permissible under this chapter. Applications shall be submitted to the zoning administrator
who shall forward the application to the planning commission for consideration.
1. Hearings. Upon filing with the planning commission an application for a conditional use
permit, the planning commission shall submit by mail to the commissioner of natural
resources a copy of the application for proposed conditional use sufficiently in advance so
that the commissioner will receive at least ten days' notice of the hearing.
2. Decisions. The planning commission shall arrive at a decision on a conditional use within
60 days. In granting a conditional use permit the planning commission shall prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards, in addition to those specified in subsection (6) of
this section, which are in conformity with the purposes of this chapter. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional
use permit is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable under
section 66-708. A copy of all decisions granting conditional use permits shall be
forwarded by mail to the commissioner of natural resources within ten days of such
action.
3. Procedures to be followed by the planning commission in passing on conditional use
permit applications within all floodplain districts.
a. Require the applicant to furnish such of the following information and additional
information as deemed necessary by the planning commission for determining the
suitability of the particular site for the proposed use:
i. Plans in triplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevation of the lot, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, floodproofing measures, and the relationship of the above to the
location of the stream channel; and
ii. Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling,
dredging, grading, channel improvement, storage of materials, water
supply and sanitary facilities.
b. Transmit one copy of the information described in subsection (a) to a designated
engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance, where
necessary, in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and
velocities, the seriousness of flood damage to the use, the adequacy of the plans
for protection, and other technical matters.
c. Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer or expert, the
planning commission shall determine the specific flood hazard at the site and
evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in relation to the flood hazard.

Sec 66-707 Nonconforming Uses
(a) A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or
amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may
be continued subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined in section 66-8 of
this chapter, shall be subject to the provisions of sections 66-707(a)(1) through (5) of this
chapter.
1. No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its
nonconformity.
2. Any structural alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming use
which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or use shall
be protected to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in accordance with any of the
elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 thru FP-4 floodproofing
classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in (3) and
(6) below.
3. The cost of all structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming structure over the
life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure unless
the conditions of this section are satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and
additions must include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost
placed on all manpower or labor. If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and
additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then the structure must
meet the standards of section 66-700 or 66-701 of this chapter for new structures
depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district,
respectively.
4. If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future use of the
building premises shall conform to this chapter. The assessor shall notify the zoning

(b) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of North Branch from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions may include but are not
limited to:
1. In responding to a suspected Ordinance violation, the zoning administrator and local
government may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but
not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for
corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of
flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct Ordinance violations to the extent possible so
as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
2. When an Ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the
zoning administrator, the zoning administrator shall immediately investigate the situation
and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is
reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of
Natural Resources' and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along
with the community's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
3. The zoning administrator shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this
chapter and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation
of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the
zoning administrator may order the construction or development immediately halted until
a proper permit or approval is granted by the community. If the construction or
development is already completed, then the zoning administrator may either:
a. Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a
specified time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official
controls; or
b. Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development
approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days.
4. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the zoning administrator within
the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional
violation of this chapter and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The zoning administrator
shall also upon the lapse of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore
the land to the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.
(Code 1996, § 17.30.120; Ord. No. 177-12, § 2, 3-12-2012)
Sec 66-709 Amendments
(a) The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be removed from floodplain areas
unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above
the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the
floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the commissioner of natural
resources if he determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the
intended use.

Sec 66-738 Nonconformities
Sec 66-739 Subdivision/Platting Provisions
Sec 66-740 Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
Sec 66-732 Statutory Authorization And Policy
(a) Statutory authorization. This shoreland management overlay district is adopted pursuant to the
authorization and policies contained in Minn. Stats. ch. 103F, Minnesota Regulations Parts
6120.2500—6120.3900, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minn. Stats., ch.
462.
(b) Policy. The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public health, safety, and
general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the
local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to
provide for the wise subdivision, use, and development of shorelands of public waters. The
Legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate
the subdivision, use, and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and
enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values
of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This
responsibility is hereby recognized by the city.
(Code 1996, § 17.32.010)
Sec 66-733 District Application
The SL shoreland management overlay district shall be applied to and superimposed upon all zoning
districts as contained herein as existing or amended by the text and map of this division. The regulations
and requirements imposed by the SL shoreland management overlay district shall be in addition to those
established for districts which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the more restrictive
requirements shall apply.
(Code 1996, § 17.32.020)
Sec 66-734 General Provisions And Definitions
(a) Jurisdiction. The provisions of this district shall apply to the shorelands of the public water bodies
as classified in section 66-736. Pursuant to Minnesota Regulations, Parts 6120.2500—
6120.3900, no lake, pond, or flow-age less than ten acres in size need be regulated in a local

government's shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private user where there was
no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the governing body, be exempt from this division.
(b) Boundaries. Shoreland areas are defined as land located within the following distances from
public waters:
1. One thousand feet from the ordinary high water level of a lake, pond, or flowage; and
2. Three hundred feet from a river or stream, or the landward extent of a floodplain
designated by this division on a river or stream, whichever is greater.
The limits of shorelands may be reduced whenever the waters involved are bounded by
topographic divides which extend landward from the waters for lesser distances and when
approved by the commissioner.
(c) Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public waters; the size and shape of lots; the use, size,
type, and location of structures on lots; the installation and maintenance of water supply and
waste treatment systems, the grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland
vegetation; and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this division
and other applicable regulations.
(d) Enforcement. The city is responsible for the administration and enforcement of this division. Any
violation of the provisions of this division or failure to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of
variances or conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined
by law. Violations of this division can occur regardless of whether or not a permit is required for a
regulated activity pursuant to section 66-735(a).
(e) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this division shall be held to
be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and
shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
(f) Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this division to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this division
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this division are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(g) Definitions. Unless specifically defined in the definitions section of this chapter, words or phrases
used in this division shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in
common usage and so as to give this division its most reasonable application. For the purpose of
this division, the words "must" and "shall" are mandatory and not permissive. All distances,
unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally.
(Code 1996, § 17.32.030)
Sec 66-735 Administration
(a) Permit required.
1. A permit is required for the construction of buildings or building additions (and including
such related activities as construction of decks and signs), the installation and/or
alteration of sewage treatment system, and those grading and filling activities not
exempted by section 66-737(c). Application for a permit shall be made to the planning
director on forms provided. The application shall include the necessary information so that
the site's suitability for the intended use can be determined and that a complete sewage
treatment system will be provided.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 157/215
2. A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall stipulate that an identified
nonconforming sewage treatment system, as defined by section 66-737(h) shall be
reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this division.
(b) Certificate of zoning compliance. The planning director shall issue a certificate of zoning
compliance for each activity requiring a permit as specified in subsection (a). This certificate will
specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this division. Any use, arrangement,
or construction at variance with that authorized by permit shall be deemed a violation of this
division and shall be punishable as provided in section 66-734(d).
(c) Variances.
1. Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minn. Stats. ch. 462, as applicable. A
variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of this division. No variance
may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in which
the subject property is located. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance
to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In
considering a variance request, the planning commission and appeals must also consider
whether the property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether
the property is used seasonally or year-round, whether the variance is being requested
solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics of development on
adjacent properties.
2. The city council shall hear and decide requests for variances in accordance with the rules
that it has adopted for the conduct of business. When a variance is approved after the
department of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record,
the notification of the approved variance required in subsection (d) of this section shall
also include the planning commission and appeals summary of the public
record/testimony and the findings of facts and conclusions which supported the issuance
of the variance.
3. For existing developments, the application for variance must clearly demonstrate whether
a conforming sewage treatment system is present for the intended use of the property.
The variance, if issued, must require reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment
system.
(d) Notifications to the department of natural resources.
1. Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, amendments, or
conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to the
commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked at least
ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed
subdivisions/plans must include copies of the subdivision/plat.
2. A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting
variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to
the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked
within ten days of final action.

2. Land use descriptions. The land use districts provided below, and the allowable land uses
therein for the given classifications of waterbodies, shall be properly delineated on the
official zoning map for the shorelands of the city. These land use districts are in
conformance with the criteria specified in Minnesota regulations, pt. 6120.3200, subp. 3
listed below:
a. A special protection district is intended to be used for two basic purposes. The first
purpose is to limit and properly manage development in areas that are generally
unsuitable for development or uses due to flooding, erosion, limiting soil
conditions, steep slopes or other major physical constraints. A second purpose is
to manage and preserve areas with special historical, natural or biological
characteristics.
b. A residential district is primarily intended to allow low to medium density seasonal
and year-round residential uses on lands suitable for such uses. It is also intended
to prevent establishment of various commercial, industrial and other uses in these
areas that cause conflicts or problems for residential uses. Some nonresidential
uses with minimal impacts on residential uses are allowed if properly managed
under conditional use procedures.
c. A high-density residential district is intended for use on lands with heterogeneous
mixes of soils, vegetation and topography that are not well suited to residential
development using standards, lot-block subdivisions. This approach enables such
areas to be developed, often even with higher than lot-block densities, while also
avoiding and preserving unsuitable terrain and soils. Other compatible uses such
as residential planned unit development, surface water-oriented commercial,
multiple unit single-family, parks, historic sites, and semi-public, and also allowed,
primarily as conditional uses.
d. A water-oriented commercial district is intended to be used only to provide for
existing or future commercial uses adjacent to water resources that are
functionally dependent on such close proximity.
e. A general use district is intended to be used only for lands already developed or
suitable for development with concentrated urban, particularly commercial, land
uses. It should not generally be used on natural environment lakes or remote river
classes. Several other intensive urban uses such as industrial and commercial
planned unit development are allowed in this district if handled as conditional
uses.

4. Additional special provisions.
a. Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities exceeding those in the tables
in subsection (a)(2) and (3) can only be allowed if designed and approved as
residential PUDs under section 66-740. Only land above the ordinary high water
level of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width
standards must be met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building
line. The sewer lot area dimensions in subsection (a)(2) can only be used if
publicly owned sewer system service is available to the property.
b. One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding the duplex lot
area and width dimensions presented in subsection (a)(1)—(3) provided the
following standards are met:
i. For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex lots, the guest
cottage must be located within the smallest duplex sized lot that could be
created including the principal dwelling unit;
ii. A guest cottage must not cover more than 700 square feet of land surface
and must not exceed 15 feet in height; and
iii. A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its visibility as
viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on
conditions.

c. Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or as recreation areas for
use by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions are permissible and must
meet or exceed the following standards:
i. They must meet the width and size requirements for residential lots, and
be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access lots.
ii. If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than six watercraft to be
allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the lot (keeping the
same lot depth) must be increased by the percent of the requirements for
riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six, consistent with the
following table:
Controlled Access Lot Frontage Requirements
Ration of Lake Size to Shore Length Required Increase in Frontage
(Acres/Miles) Percent
Less than 100 25
101 to 200 20
201 to 300 15

Greater than 400 5
iii. They must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or
by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided
riparian access rights on the access lot.
iv. Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be developed
that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what
activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching,
loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must also include
other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with the
general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property
rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant conflict
activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants must
limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number
of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over
water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities
in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and
vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage
buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography
as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer
leaf-on conditions.

(b) Placement, design, and height of structures.
1. Placement of structures on lots. When more than one setback applies to a site, structures
and facilities must be located to meet all setback. Where structures exist on the adjoining
lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a
variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided
the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone.
Structures shall be located as follows:
a. Structure and on-site sewage system setbacks (in feet) from ordinary high water
level.*

d. Uses without water-oriented needs. Uses without water-oriented needs must be
located on lots or parcels without public water frontage, or, if located on lots or
parcels with public water frontage, must either be set back double the normal
ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the
water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer leaf-on conditions.

2. Design criteria for structures.
a. High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with any
floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the
elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed or floodproofed
must be determined as follows:
i. For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet above the
highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high water
level, whichever is higher.
ii. For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above
the flood of record, if data is available. If data is not available, by placing
the lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary high water level, or
by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of proposed
construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a flood
protection elevation. Under all three approaches, technical evaluations
must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with parts
6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management of floodplain areas. If
more than one approach is used, the highest flood elevation determined
must be used for placing structures and other facilities.
iii. Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed
lower than the elevation determined in this time if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration
flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and wind
driven waves and debris.
b. Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-oriented
accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in subsection (b)(1)
of this section if the water-oriented accessory structure complies with the following
provisions:
i. The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height, exclusive of
safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square feet.
Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point;
ii. The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level
must be at least ten feet;
iii. The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from
public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions;
iv. The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not be enclosed
or used as a storage area;
v. The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human habitation
and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities; and
vi. As an alternative for general development and recreational development
waterbodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft
storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented
sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet, provided
the maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the
configuration of the shoreline.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 173/215
c. Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to
major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down bluffs and steep
slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design
requirements:
i. Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on residential lots.
Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public open space
recreational properties, and planned unit developments;
ii. Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not exceed 32
square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for
commercial properties, public open space recreational properties, and
planned unit developments;
iii. Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings;
iv. Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground
on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed
and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
v. Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually
inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public
water assuming summer leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
vi. Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped
persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided
that the dimensional and performance standards of subsections 66-737(b)
(2)b.1.—5. are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota
Regulations, ch. 1340.
d. Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a significant historic site in
a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about the
site has been removed and documented in a public repository.
e. Steep slopes. The planning director or the city engineer must evaluate possible
soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a
permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures,
or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, the city will
attach conditions to permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation
screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of
public waters, assuming summer leaf-on vegetation.
3. Height of structures. All structures in residential districts, except churches and
nonresidential agricultural structures, must not exceed 25 feet in height unless otherwise
regulated in the ordinances.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 174/215
(c) Shoreland alteration. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent
erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values,
prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
1. Vegetation alterations.
a. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and sewage
treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking areas regulated by
subsection (d) of this section are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards
that follow.
b. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest management
uses as regulated in subsection (f)(2) and (3) of this section, respectfully, is
allowed subject to the following standards:
i. Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and
on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest land
conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed
and approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the
property is located.
ii. In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of
trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to
provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas,
access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access
areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities,
provided that:
(1) The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed
from the water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
(2) Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved; and
(3) The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of trees,
limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards.

2. Topographic alteration/grading and filling.
a. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of structures,
sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly issued construction
permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a separate grading and
filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this section must be
incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage
treatment systems, and driveways.
b. Public roads and parking areas are regulated by subsection (d) of this section.
c. Notwithstanding subsections a. and b. of this section, a grading and filling permit
will be required for:
i. The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep slopes or
within shore or bluff impact zones; and
ii. The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of steep
slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 176/215
d. The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the
issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use
permits, variances, and subdivision approvals:
i. Grading or filling in any Type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland must be
evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity would affect
the following functional qualities of the wetland:
(1) Sediment and pollution trapping and retention;
(2) Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
(3) Fish and wildlife habitat;
(4) Recreational use;
(5) Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
(6) Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or
others.
The applicant is responsible for determining whether the wetland
alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals
by other local, state, or federal agencies such as a watershed
district, the department of natural resources, or the United States
Army Corps of Engineers. Documentation of such is required prior
to issuance of permits.
ii. Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures only
the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time
possible;
iii. Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible;
iv. Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach
any surface water feature must be used;
v. Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards
consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation Service;
vi. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that creates an
unstable slope;
vii. Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be reviewed
by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must not create
finished slopes of 30 percent or greater;
viii. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact zones;
ix. Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters must
first be authorized by the commissioner under Minn. Stats. § 103G.245;
x. Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are accessory to
permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or
nearby properties; and

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 177/215
xi. Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the
shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope
does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward
extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water level, and
the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does not
exceed three feet.
e. Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose is
connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors,
must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be
given only after the commissioner has approved the proposed connection to public
waters.
(d) Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas.
1. Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of
natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public
waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that all roads and
parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public
waters consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation district, or other applicable technical materials.
2. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and must not be
placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible
placement alternatives exist. If no such alternatives exist, they may be placed within these
areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
3. Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related parking
areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening and
erosion control conditions of this subpart are met. For private facilities, the grading and
filling provisions of subsection (c)(2) of this section must be met.

(e) Stormwater management. The following general and specific standards shall apply:
1. General standards.
a. When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and vegetated soil
surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before
discharge to public waters.
b. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the
extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and
delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon
as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on the site. Erosion
and sediment control best management practices shall meet the standards of the
city's engineering design standards for stormwater management.
c. When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation
conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural
features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions,
settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used to
control and regulate stormwater. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
manmade materials and facilities. Stormwater management best management
practices shall meet the standards contained in chapter 58, section 58-260,
approval standards and the city's engineering design standards for stormwater

(f) Special provisions for commercial, industrial, public/semipublic, agricultural and forestry.
1. Standards for commercial, industrial, public and semipublic uses.
a. Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public or semipublic uses
with similar needs to have access to and use of public waters may be located on
parcels or lots with frontage on public waters. Those uses with water-oriented
needs must meet the following standards:
i. In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks, and other
zoning standards in this division, the uses must be designed to incorporate
topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and structures;
ii. Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must centralize
these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of navigation and to
be the minimum size necessary to meet the need; and
iii. Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs and
lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the following
general standards:
(1) No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be placed
in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety
messages may be placed in or on public waters by a public
authority or under a permit issued by the county sheriff;
(2) Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the shore impact
zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary
to convey needed information. They must only convey the location
and name of the establishment and the general types of goods or
services available. The signs must not contain other detailed
information such as a product brands and prices, must not be
located higher than ten feet above the ground, and must not
exceed 32 square feet in size. If illuminated by artificial lights, the
lights must be shielded or directed to prevent illumination out
across public waters; and
(3) Other outside lighting may be located within the shore impact zone
or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential
safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent
direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude
use of navigational lights.
b. Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without
public water frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public water frontage,
must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be
substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography,
assuming summer leaf-on conditions.

structures subject to state pollution control standards, but not including
commercial feed lots or other commercial operations and not including
agricultural uses located in platted subdivisions.
c. Animal feedlots must meet the following standards:
i. New feedlots must not be located in the shoreland of watercourses or in
bluff impact zones and must meet a minimum setback of 300 feet from the
ordinary high water level of all public water basins; and
ii. Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are located within 300
feet of the ordinary high water level or within a bluff impact zone are
allowed if they do not further encroach into the existing ordinary high water
level setback or encroach on bluff impact zones.
3. Forest management standards. The harvesting of timber and associated reforestation
must be conducted consistent with the provisions of the Minnesota Nonpoint Source
Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the provisions of water quality in forest management
"Best Management Practices in Minnesota."

pollution control agency.
2. Sewage treatment. Any premises used for human occupancy must be provided with an
adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows:
a. Publicly-owned sewer systems must be used where available.
b. All private sewage treatment systems must meet or exceed the state pollution
control agency's standards for individual sewage treatment systems contained in
the document titled, "Individual Sewage Treatment Systems Standards, ch. 7080,"
a copy of which is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
division.
c. On-site sewage treatment systems must be set back from the ordinary high water
level in accordance with the setback contained in subsection (b)(1) of this section.
d. All proposed sites for individual sewage treatment systems shall be evaluated in
accordance with the criteria in subsection 66-737(h)(2)d.1.—4. If the determination
of a site's suitability cannot be made with publicly available, existing information, it
shall then be the responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient soil borings
and percolation tests for on-site field investigations. Evaluation criteria:
i. Depth to the highest known or calculated ground water table or bedrock;
ii. Soil conditions, properties, and permeability;
iii. Slope; and
iv. The existence of lowlands, local surface depressions, and rock outcrops.
e. Nonconforming sewage treatment systems shall be regulated and upgraded in
accordance with section 66-738(2).
(Code 1996, § 17.32.060; Ord. No. 227-15, § 2, 5-26-2015)
Sec 66-738 Nonconformities
All legally established nonconformities as of the date of this division may continue, but they will be
managed according to applicable state statutes and other regulations of the city for the subjects of
alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and intensification of use; except
that the following standards will also apply in shoreland areas:
(a) Construction on nonconforming lots of record.
1. Subject to the requirements of section 66-133 et seq., lots of record in the office of the
county recorder on the date of enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the
requirements of section 66-737(a) may be allowed as building sites without variances
from lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has
been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became substandard,
was created complying with official controls in effect at the time, and sewage treatment
and setback requirements of this division are met.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 183/215
2. A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any use, sewage
treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the
planning commission shall consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities or
constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
3. If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any individual lot
does not meet the requirements of section 66-737(a), the lot must not be considered as a
separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be
combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land,
each meeting the requirements of section 66-737(a) as much as possible.
(b) Additions/expansions to nonconforming structures.
1. A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of section 66-737(h) must be
upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any
improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage
treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the
sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
2. The governing body of the city has by formal resolution notified the commissioner of its
program to identify nonconforming sewage treatment system. The city will require
upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system identified by this program within
a reasonable period of time which will not exceed two years. Sewerage systems installed
according to all applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under Minn.
Stats. § 105.485, in effect at the time of installation may be considered as conforming
unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching
pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment
area separation above groundwater than required by the state pollution control agency's
chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered
nonconforming.
(Code 1996, § 17.32.070)
Sec 66-739 Subdivision/Platting Provisions
(a) Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivisions, including planned unit developments
authorized under section 66-740, must be suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with
minimal alteration. Suitability analysis by the local unit of government shall consider susceptibility
to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for
development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, inadequate water supply or sewage
treatment capabilities, near shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water based recreation,
important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of the
natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the
proposed subdivision of the city.
(b) Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions must conform to all official controls of the city. A
subdivision will not be approved where a later variance from one or more standards in official
controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by
publicly owned sewerage and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless domestic
water supply is available and sewage treatment system consistent with section 66-737(b) and (h)
can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional
requirements of section 66-737(a), including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is
free of limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment systems. Lots
that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved.

(c) Information requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted by the applicant for the
community to make a determination of land suitability. The information shall include at least the
following:
1. Topographic contours at two foot intervals or less from United States Geological Survey
maps or more accurate sources, showing limiting site characteristics;
2. The surface water features required in Minn. Stats. § 505.02, subd. 1, to be shown on
plats, obtained from United States Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or
more accurate sources;
3. Adequate soils information to determine suitability for building and on-site sewage
treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current existing sources or from field
investigations such as soil borings, percolation tests, or other methods;
4. Information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply; extent of anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic conditions, including depths,
types of bottom sediments, and aquatic vegetation; and proposed methods for controlling
stormwater runoff and erosion, both during and after construction activities;
5. Location of 100-year floodplain areas and floodway subdistricts from existing adopted
maps or data; and
6. A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level, the "toe" and the "top" of
bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from the top of the bluff and the lake
or stream.
(d) Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of subdivision approval, the
approval must provide easements over natural drainage or ponding areas for management of
stormwater and significant wetlands.
(e) Platting. All subdivisions that create two or more lots or parcels shall be processed as a plat in
accordance with Minn. Stats. ch. 505. No permit for construction of buildings or sewage
treatment systems shall be issued for lots created after these official controls were enacted
unless the lot was approved as part of a formal subdivision.
(f) Controlled access or recreational lots. Lot intended as controlled access to public waters or for
recreational use areas for use by nonriparian lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the
sizing criteria in section 66-737(a)(4).
(Code 1996, § 17.32.080)
Sec 66-740 Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
(a) Types of PUDs permissible. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are allowed for new projects on
undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built sites, or conversions of existing buildings
and land. The land use districts in which they are an allowable use are identified in the land use
district descriptions in section 66-736(b) and the official zoning map.
(b) Processing of PUDs. PUDs must be processed as a conditional use, except that an expansion to
an existing commercial PUD involving six or less new dwelling units or sites since the date of this
division was adopted is permissible as a permitted use provided the total project density does not
exceed the allowable densities calculated in the project density evaluation procedures in
subsection (f) of this section. Approval cannot occur until the environmental review process
(EAW/EIS) is complete.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 185/215
(c) Application for a PUD. The applicant for a PUD must submit the following documents prior to final
action being taken on the application request:
1. A site plan and/or plat for the project showing locations of property boundaries, surface
water features, existing and proposed structures and other facilities, land alterations,
sewage treatment and water supply systems (where public systems will not be provided),
and topographic contours at the foot intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined
commercial and recreational development, the site plan and/or plat must indicate and
distinguish which buildings and portions of the project are residential, commercial, or a
combination of the two.
2. A property owners' association agreement (for residential PUDs) with mandatory
membership, and all in accordance with the requirements of subsection (f) of this section.
3. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other instruments that:
a. Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations, construction of
additional buildings, beaching of watercraft, and construction of commercial
buildings in residential PUDs; and
b. Ensure the long term preservation and maintenance of open space in accordance
with the criteria and analysis specified in subsection (f) of this section.
4. When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and the floor plan for all
commercial structures to be occupied.
5. Those additional documents as requested by the city that are necessary to explain how
the PUD will be designed and will function.

(d) Site "suitable area" evaluations. Proposed new or expansions to existing PUDs must be
evaluated using the following procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the
dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in section 66-739(e).
1. The project parcel must be divided in tiers by locating one or more lines approximately
parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the following intervals,
proceeding landward:
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
Unsewerd Sewered
(feet) (feet)
General development lakes - First tier 200 200
General development lakes - Second and additional
tiers 267 200
Recreational development lakes 267 267
Natural environment lakes 400 320
All river classes 300 300
2. The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier area all
wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This suitable
area and proposed project are then subject to either the residential or commercial PUD
density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.

(e) Residential and commercial PUD density evaluation. The procedures for determining the "base"
density of a PUD and density increase multipliers are as follows. Allowable densities may be
transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the water body, but must not be transferred
to any other tier closer.
1. Residential PUD "base" density evaluation.
a. .The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size
standard for lakes or, for rivers, the single residential lot width standard times the
tier depth, unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative
minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of
dwelling units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling
units or sites for the residential PUD are then compared with the tier, density, and
suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in subsection (f) of this section.

2. Commercial PUD "base" density evaluation.
a. Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each
tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside
living area sizes need not include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or
porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.

200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios listed for 1,500
square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400 square
feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational camping areas shall use a ratio
equal to the size of the manufactured home, or if unknown, the ratio listed for
1,000 square feet.
c. Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor
area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or site.

(f) Maintenance and design criteria.
1. Maintenance and administration requirements.
a. Provisions. Before final approval by the city of a PUD, adequate provisions must
be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and
for the continued existence and functioning of the development.
b. Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements,
public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent
means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation and maintenance of
open space. The instruments must include all of the following protections:
i. Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs);
ii. Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine maintenance
prohibited;
iii. Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles and other
materials prohibited; and
iv. Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
c. Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally effective alternative
community framework is established, when applicable, all residential PUDs must
use an owners association with the following features:
i. Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site purchaser
and any successive purchasers;
ii. Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association's expenses,
and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites;
iii. Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing conditions;
and
iv. The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes, and
maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.

https://northbranch.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=code&name=Chapter_66_ZONING 192/215
2. Open space requirements. PUDs must contain open space meeting all of the following
criteria:
a. At least 50 percent of the total project area must be preserved as open space;
b. Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces,
parking areas, or structures, except water-oriented accessory structures or
facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the computation of
minimum open space;
c. Open space must include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for
development in their natural states, and areas containing significant historic sites
or unplatted cemeteries;
d. Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of
dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling units or sites, and
by the general public;
e. Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if the use of the
space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems;
f. Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may contain wateroriented
accessory structures or facilities;
g. The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation, and
allowable uses, must be preserved by the use of restrictive deed covenants,
permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally
effective and permanent means; and
h. The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be included as
open space. For residential PUDs, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone
area of existing developments or at least 70 percent of the shore impact zone area
of new developments must be preserved in its natural existing state. For
commercial PUDs, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone must be
preserved in its natural state.
3. Erosion control and stormwater management. Erosion control and stormwater
management plans must be developed and the PUD must:
a. Be designed and the construction managed to minimize the likelihood of serious
erosion occurring either during or after construction. This must be accomplished
by limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground exposure. Temporary
ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or other
appropriate techniques must be used to minimize erosion impacts on surface
water features. Erosion and sediment control best management practices shall
meet the standards of the city's engineering design standards for stormwater
management. Erosion control plans approved by a soil and water conservation
district may be required if project size and site physical characteristic warrant; and
b. Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected
quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within
any tier must not exceed 25 percent of the tier area, except that for commercial
PUDs 35 percent impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of
general development lakes with an approved stormwater management plan and
consistency with section 66-737(c). All stormwater management plans shall meet
the standards contained in chapter 58, section 58-260, approval standards and
the city's engineering design standards for stormwater management.

4. Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design of facilities and structures
must be done according to the following standards:
a. PUDs must be connected to publicly owned water supply and sewerage systems,
if available. On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems must be
centralized and designed and installed to meet or exceed applicable standards or
rules of the state department of health and sections 66-737(b) and (h). On-site
sewage treatment systems must be located on the most suitable areas of the
development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors must be provided for
a replacement soil treatment system for each sewerage system;
b. Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups and located on
suitable areas of the development. They must be designed and dimensional
standards for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high
water level, elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height.
Setbacks from the ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with
section 66-740 (e)(2)b. of this division for developments with density increases;
c. Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to swimming areas, docks, and
watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must be centralized and located in
areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability must include consideration of land
slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, and depth to ground water and bedrock, or
other relevant factors. The number of spaces provided for continuous beaching,
mooring, or docking of watercraft must not exceed one for each allowable dwelling
unit or site in the first tier (notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing
commercially used harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for
loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of
dwelling units or sites located in other tiers;
d. Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be treated to reduce visibility
as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the local unit of
government, assuming summer leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic
screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided;
e. Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented accessory structures,
must meet the required principal structure setback and must be centralized; and
f. Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed if they meet or
exceed design standards contained in subsection (b) and are centralized.

(g) Conversions. The city may allow existing resorts or other land uses and facilities to be converted
to residential PUDs if all of the following standards are met:
1. Proposed conversions must be initially evaluated using the same procedures for
residential PUDs involving all new construction. Inconsistencies between existing features
of the development and these standards must be identified.
2. Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment, structure color, impervious
coverage, open space, and shore recreation facilities must be corrected as part of the
conversion or as specified in the conditional use permit
3. Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be evaluated and reasonable
improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements must include, where
applicable, the following:
a. Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or other facilities that no longer need to
be located in shore or bluff impact zones;
b. Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve vegetative cover and
screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from the water; and
c. If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff impact zones, conditions are
attached to approvals of conversions that preclude exterior expansions in any
dimension or substantial alterations. The conditions must also provide for future
relocation of dwelling units, where feasible, to other locations, meeting all setback
and elevation requirements when they are rebuilt or replaced.
4. Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed standards in subsection (e)
may be allowed to continue but must not be allowed to be increased, either at the time of
conversion or in the future. Efforts must be made during the conversion to limit impacts of
high densities by requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative screening, centralizing
shore recreation facilities, installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means.

Sec 66-765 District Application
(a) The WL wetland systems district shall be applied to and superimposed upon the zoning districts
contained in this chapter existing or amended by the text and map of this chapter. The
regulations and requirements imposed by the WL wetland systems district shall be in addition to
those established for the district which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the
more restrictive requirements shall apply.
(b) The wetland systems district within the city is defined and established to include those areas
which include any watercourse, natural drainage system, water body or wetland, that may be
subject to periodic flooding, overflow or seasonally high water tables. The district boundary lines
shall be established at the edge of the aforesaid areas as depicted on the wetland systems map.
The wetland systems map is based upon geographical, hydrological and surficial geological data
obtained from the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service. These
specific soils are characterized as unsuitable for development due to their poor drainage
qualities, flooding proneness, poor texture, high water table depth and general organic content.

Sec 66-767 Development Regulations
(a) Wetland systems impact plan. Land owners or developers desiring to develop land, construct any
structure or any artificial obstruction on land, dig, dredge or in any other way alter, remove or
deposit material or structures onto or from a wetland within the city shall first submit a conditional
use permit application as regulated by section 66-62 et seq. and a plan of development,
hereinafter referred to as a wetland systems impact plan, which shall set forth proposed
provisions for sediment control, water management, maintenance of landscaped features, and
any additional matters intended to improve or maintain the quality of the environment. Such a
plan shall set forth proposed changes requested by the applicant and affirmatively disclose what,
if any, change will be made in the natural condition of the earth, including loss or change of earth
ground cover, destruction of trees, grade changes and its effect, if any, upon lakes, streams,
watercourses and marshes, lowlands and wetlands in the area. The plan shall minimize tree
removal, ground cover change, loss of natural vegetation, and grade changes as much as
possible, and shall affirmatively provide for the relocation or replanting of as many trees as
possible which are proposed to be removed. The purpose of the wetland systems impact plan
shall be to eliminate as much as possible potential pollution, erosion and siltation.
(b) High water elevation. For lakes, ponds or flowages, no structure except boat houses, piers and
docks, shall be placed at an elevation such that the lowest floor, including basement floor, is less
than three feet above the highest known water level. In those instances where sufficient data on
known high water levels are not available, the elevation of the line of permanent shoreland
vegetation shall be used as the estimated high water elevation. When fill is required to meet this
elevation, the fill shall be allowed to stabilize and construction shall not begin until the property
has been inspected by the planning director. Cut slopes shall be a maximum of 1:1, or 100
percent; fill slope 3:1 or 30 percent; and construction slope 5:1, or 20 percent.

connecting to municipal utilities when available subject to Section 58-76 of City Code;
6. that all remaining buildable property will have restrictions placed upon the land requiring
connection to municipal utilities and a requirement of additional lots to be created above
that which would be required under the zoning code should the acreage lots without
municipal services had not been created;
7. that the lots to be developed will be located as far from the existing services as practical
so as not to interfere with the construction and installation of future municipal services;
8. that a separate deed or deed restriction, as appropriate, must be filed for the affected
